"1",17,"AFG",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  it is my pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the high post of the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly  it is our conviction that  under your able guidance  our gathering will bear fruitful results in the preservation and consolidation of peace.I should like to express my Government's full appreciation of the efforts of Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuellar  the United Nations Secretary-General  and his wise conduct of the Organization's work.The people and Government of Afghanistan attach enormous importance to the role played by the United Nations in regulating international relations and peacefully resolving conflicts through political means  based on acceptable and just solutions.The international problems under discussion in the Assembly are serious and difficult. There is no doubt  however  that the threat of a nuclear conflagration and the use of force are the central concerns of all nations  all realistic and far-sighted statesmen and peace-loving circles of the globe. Solution of these problems requires а new way of political thinking.My Government believes that no exceptional security can ever exist for any individual Power unless durable and genuine peace  founded on general and complete disarmament  is established for all. Not a single country can ever breathe freely under the shadows of nuclear missiles and the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) project of the United States of America. The possibilities existing in contemporary international relations and all the potentialities of the United Nations should be deployed for the solving of world problems and towards the establishment of a universally acceptable political and legal mechanism to regulate international relations.We warmly welcome the possibility of the signing of an agreement on the elimination of medium- and short-range nuclear missiles in Europe created during recent talks in Washington between the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union and the United States of America. It is our hope that the experience gained during those talks will be utilized towards banning nuclear tests and reducing and finally eliminating strategic nuclear weapons.The Government of Afghanistan follows with increasing concern dangerous regional developments in various parts of the world. In the strategic Gulf region  expansionist and neo-globalistic imperialist policies have created an explosive situation. The concentration of huge naval forces of the United States of America and its allies has posed the serious threat of a new flare-up of uncontrollable dimensions. We favour implementation of the proposal for the withdrawal of foreign naval forces from that region.The senseless war between Iran and Iraq has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands and has inflicted heavy material losses on both sides. We support resolution 598 (1987) of the Security Council  which calls for an immediate cease-fire.The powder-keg tension in the Middle East  which is on the verge of explosion  remains unchanged because of the continued Israeli occupation of Arab lands and denial of the Palestinian people's legitimate right to self-determination and statehood. The convening of an international conference with the participation of all parties concerned is the only reasonable way for the solution of this issue. It is imperative to search for a viable and comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem and thus to eliminate a dangerous centre of tension in the Eastern Mediterranean region through the convocation of an international conference within the framework of the United Nations. In this region  again  provocations from across the ocean has further escalated discord and conflict In Lebanon.The Pretoria regime continues its policy of apartheid in South Africa through the violent oppression of the people  in spite of the unanimous demand for its termination by the entire world.The noble efforts of the United Nations for securing the independence of the people of Namibia is being obstructed and aggression is still being carried by the apartheid regime against Angola and other front-line States  Here  too  the interventionist hand of the United States is clearly involved.The United States armed threats against Latin America have clearly surfaced  with the scandalous military and financial aid to the Nicaraguan contras. The recent accord reached in Guatemala among the leaders of the five Central American nations once again revealed the practical nature of the Contadora peace process as well as the need for putting an end to foreign interventions in the affairs of the region.We express our solidarity with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the unification of North and South Korea and for the denuclearisation of the Korea peninsula. The reconciliation process Initiated in the People's Republic of Kampuchea deserves appreciation and support. It is our hope that all sides concerned will welcome this meaningful and positive process. I should like to express high appreciation and support for the role of the constructive peace proposals and initiatives offered by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other socialist countries  peace efforts initiated by the United Nations  member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement  reflected in the Harare Declaration and the Delhi six proposals  as well as for endeavours of the national liberation and progressive movements.The world economic situation la still appalling. No doubt this will have grave consequences. The increase in the number of the least developed countries from 31 in 1981 to 40 in 1986 indicates the sad reality of the prevailing international economic life. The present world economic situation Is not unrelated to the arms race. Only checking the arms race can release the necessary resources to improve the world economic situation.Unless international economic security becomes an Integral part of the overall global security and is strictly observed  a rapid and stable harmonious growth rate and the establishment of a new International economic order will not be achieved.The debt crisis  debt servicing and high interest rates along with protectionist policies have led to the retardation or total suspension of development programmes in the developing and least developing countries. Concerning the objective realities in my country  I should like to state that with the victory of the April Revolution  our people rose only to fight against backwardness  illiteracy  ignorance  disease  poverty and unemployment in our society.For nine years  however  an undeclared war has been continuing against our country by the enemies of Afghanistan. Prom its very inception this war  waged through some neighbouring countries  has been increasingly intensified and has assumed new dimensions every year. Billions of dollars have been poured in by the Washington Administration and other imperialist and reactionary circles for fuelling this war. As a result  thousands of Afghans have either been martyred or crippled  and hundreds of thousands of others have been displaced and now live pathetic lives in exile.The war has also ruined our national economy. For instance  2 000 schools  350 bridges  50 cultural centres  131 hospitals  224 mosques and holy places of worship  258 production institutions  thousands of kilometres of highways and communication lines  and thousands of trucks have been destroyed or burned. Total damage to our national economy has reached billions of Afghanis  amounting to three fourths of all the total development investment in the past 50 years in Afghanistan. Huge defence expenditures  which otherwise could have brought about an improvement in the living conditions of the people  have burdened our fragile economy.This situation has made it imperative for every Afghan to think about how to overcome this state of affairs. This necessary determination  new political thinking and the common endeavour of every patriot is directed towards putting an end to fratricide and establishing peace and tranquillity in the country. This determination and new political thinking found reflection in the policy of national reconciliation which came into effect on 25 January 1987. This policy is in total conformity with the principles of humanism  Islam  Afghan traditions  the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The proclamation of a unilateral cease-fire and its further extension; the proclamation of a general amnesty  including the release of prisoners; the endorsement of new legislation regarding better regulation of agrarian issues; the exemption of interest on debts and tariffs of the peasants; the returning of confiscated properties to the returnees; the encouragement and development of private investment; the adoption of new and suitable terms for conscription to the national service; and other such steps have recently been taken for the public welfare.More than 3 200 commissions for national reconciliation have been established throughout the country. About 83 000 of our refugee compatriots have returned  despite obstacles created by neighbouring countries. More than 30 000 members of the armed opposition groups have laid down their weapons inside the country and are co-operating with the Government in preserving peace and security in their localities. Nearly 600 armed opposition groups encompassing 53 000 people are in contact and negotiating with the Government.The new Law of Political Parties which guarantees the activity of various parties has been endorsed. This is the first of its kind in the entire history of the country. The draft of the new constitution has been prepared and published for public debate by the people of Afghanistan both in and outside the country. In line with its history and traditions  Afghanistan has been proclaimed  in the constitution  as an independent  sovereign and non-aligned country  which shall enter into no military pacts and shall allow no foreign military bases on its territory. It is enshrined in the new constitution that Islam is the religion of the people of Afghanistan. Comrade Najib  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  has rightly stated that ""the new constitution is the constitution of conciliation.The achievement of national reconciliation would have been much greater if some of the countries had not adopted a hostile stand towards it. Yes  it is not proceeding without difficulty. However  no alternative exists for putting an end to war and bloodshed. To realize the policy of national reconciliation  the practical participation of all the political parties and groups  together with the clergymen  patriotic personalities and social organizations is required· Consistent efforts have been made to establish a national unity coalition government with the participation < f the representatives of all sects and strata of society· These include the seven Islamic parties  supporters of the former King  and other groups and individual who are ready to join the process of national reconciliation. In this regard  various specific high posts of State in the legislative  judicial and executive organs have also been proposed to them. The policy of national reconciliation has not only been welcomed in the country but also enjoys international support. The socialist countries  the majority of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement and some of the countries members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (QIC)  as well as international organizations  political parties and peace-loving and progressive forces  have welcomed this bold and courageous peace initiative of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and given it various kinds of support. The resolute support of the Soviet Union for national reconciliation  and its economic assistance  once again refute the charges from some quarters against Afghan-Soviet friendship.Goodwill delegations from the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan recently paid visits to various countries of the world. The purpose behind these visits was to inform those countries about the realities of Afghan society and invite their delegations to visit Afghanistan to acquaint themselves with developments in our country. I should like to express my gratitude for the goodwill of those countries and their support for the noble and humane cause of my country.I also express my appreciation to those international organizations - including the International Committee of the Red Cross  the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees - which have begun visiting and communicating and co-operating with Afghanistan. It is precisely since the announcement of the programme for national reconciliation that the flow of modern weapons supplied to the opposition by their supporters abroad has sharply increased. The United States of America has increased its financial aid for the continuation of the undeclared war from $530 million last year to $630 million in the current year  and it will reach $1 000 million next year. The United States has also increased the dispatch of modern Stinger missiles to the extremists from 6o units last year to 600 units this year and has started to supply them with 12ϋ mm long-range mortars. The United Kingdom  too  has further increased the dispatch of Blowpipe missiles to the extremists. These weapons have been used to shell cities and villages  carry out terrorist acts and shoot down civilian aircraft  murdering innocent passengers  including children  women and old people. It is clear that our enemies have not abandoned the policy of ""war to the last Afghan"".Our people firmly believe that with the full realization of the policy of national reconciliation  nationwide peace will inevitably be ensured in the country. Unfortunately  however  in the course of the general debate at this session of the General Assembly  there have been some speeches in which attempts have been made to distort the substance of the processes going on in and around Afghanistan and to cast doubts on the policy of national reconciliation.I should like to emphasize another very significant development which is at variance with the allegations of those who want to transform the constructive discussion going on in the General Assembly into a battleground of confrontation. I have in mind the fact that it is precisely since the last session of the General Assembly that there has been radical progress at the Geneva talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan  with the participation of the representative of the Secretary-General.The negotiating sides have been able to prepare the main documents comprising a political settlement  and these are virtually complete. The gap between the positions of the two sides on the time-frame for the return of troops has been narrowed down to only eight months. We appeal to the Pakistani side to adopt a constructive stand and demonstrate political realism. This will enable us to solve remaining differences  including those concerning the time-frame  and the next round of talks will prove conclusive.The policy of national reconciliation and the Geneva talks are contributing as two separate processes to the achievement of a single objective. That objective is to ensure peace inside the country and achieve a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan.In this connection  I wish to point to the ineffective nature of the resolutions on Afghanistan adopted by this Assembly over some years now. They have failed to bring about a guaranteed cessation of Interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan as the root cause of the tense situation there. The removal of that root cause could rapidly make possible a comprehensive settlement  I therefore appeal to all in this Assembly to embark upon a move which instead of Impeding will facilitate a settlement.I assure representatives that the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is fully prepared to take a constructive position and participate actively in the preparation of a truly balanced draft resolution that would contribute to the speediest possible political solution of the situation around Afghanistan.it is our conviction that the General Assembly can help bring about a favourable international atmosphere conducive to the political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan and to the process of national reconciliation in the country. Both processes have recently gained considerable momentum. Afghanistan is on the threshold of a crucial historical change. We believe that a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan is in full accord with the interests of both our people and all the nations of the region. It will ensure peace and security in the region and in the world and in no way prove contrary to the national interest of any other country."
"2",56,"AGO",42,1987,"﻿First of all  Sir  please allow me  on behalf of my Government  to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the office of President of the General Assembly at this session. There can be no doubt that your election is testimony to  and recognition of  your personal devotion to the struggle that is being waged by the international community to realize the rights of peoples to freedom and independence. It is likewise a well deserved tribute to the country you represent so worthily. I should like therefore to take this opportunity to convey to you our best wishes for success in carrying out your task.Permit me to take this opportunity also to express my appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh  for the outstanding  very wise and skilful way in which he was able to overcome the obstacles to his mandate and to carry out successfully his difficult mission. It would be unpardonable if I were not also to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General  for his untiring efforts in the quest for solutions to the many problems still facing mankind and for his devotion to the basic principles of the Organization  despite the limited means available to him and the political and economic circumstances which are so difficult and which characterize today's world.Allow me also to congratulate Mr. Reed on his recent nomination to the high post of Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs.At the same time every year  the representatives of most of the nations of the world meet in this same hall to take up the questions that afflict mankind and to try to find lasting solutions to them. Despite this  the spectres of famine  drought  underdevelopment and foreign debt continue to haunt the minds of the leaders of the least developed countries  and these factors  together with the unbridled arms race  particularly in the nuclear sphere  continue to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. Moreover  the arms race remains  we feel  a grave threat to the survival of all of mankind.The Government of the People's Republic of Angola is convinced that a policy of dialogue and harmonization is the only assurance of a genuine policy for reducing conflicts and tensions among nations thus creating a climate of trust conducive not only to the peaceful settlement of disputes but also to disarmament. We therefore welcome the historic meeting between the leaders of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany which took place less than three weeks ago  as well as the agreement of principle reached between the Soviet Union and the United States of America several days ago to sign a treaty on the total elimination of medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe.The problems of development are inseparable from the problem of peace.Without peace there is no stability and without stability there will be no possibility of development. The implementation of the development programmes in our country is inseparable from political and economic stability. This requires solving the so-called regional conflicts which some of our countries have faced either directly or indirectly. In our humble opinion these efforts for peace should be made by the international community as a whole. For that reason the Government of the People's Republic of Angola supports the idea of the creation of a fund for the economic and social development of the developing countries.Indeed  the problem of underdevelopment facing most of the third-world countries is widening the gap that already exists between the rich and poor nations and thus constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.In this context  we hail the holding  under the auspices of the United Nations  of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. To be sure  much remains to be done: there are many gaps in the final document and it does not reflect all the hopes of the underdeveloped countries  particularly the hope for the establishment of a development fund for the developing countries. The holding of the Conference and the adoption by consensus of a final document by the Conference  despite the attempts to frustrate it  are  in any case  an important milestone in the efforts we are all making to attain our objectives of peace and security. It marks a beginning and we hope that this trend will continue and increase and that it will yield much more tangible results for the benefit of peace and development.Moved as we are by the desire to contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the United Nations Charter  the African countries are sparing no effort to keep our continent free of nuclear weapons. The People's Republic of Angola feels that the proclamation of the southern Atlantic as a zone of peace and co-operation  free of nuclear arms and military pacts  is a sure way to guarantee peaceful co-existence. In this context  the independence of Namibia  on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)   and the elimination of apartheid would also contribute to strengthening international security and co-operation in the region in the mutual interests of the countries of the southern Atlantic region.Allow me to express our profound gratitude for the untiring efforts of the international community and of the United Nations to find fair and lasting solutions to the problems of our times. Nevertheless  I cannot fail to express my concern at the fact that there remain many unresolved issues  such as decolonisation  apartheid  famine and drought.Since its independence almost 12 years ago the Government of the People's Republic of Angola has followed a policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence. This policy is set down in its constitutional law  which establishes  as clearly as possible  its intention to maintain diplomatic relations with all the countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect  sovereignty  territorial integrity  non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of each State  and respect for the norms of international law governing relations among independent States.Unfortunately  in the sub-region of southern Africa  a reactionary and anachronistic regime  that of racist South Africa  continues to flout United Nations resolutions and arrogantly carries out  with impunity  acts of subversion and destabilization against the countries of the area  including my own  with the sole purpose of perpetuating its illegal occupation of Namibia and thereby delay the elimination of the odious system of apartheid.We are a people that cherishes peace and justice  but ever since our country achieved independence we have not known a single day of peace. In an undeclared war imposed on it  Angola has been victimized by acts of armed aggression on the part of the racist regime of South Africa. Our people and our Government are thus obliged to make enormous sacrifices for the effects of the war are fraught with heavy consequences in terms of our financial  material and human resources and inevitably undermine the economic and social development of our country.In this unjust war imposed on us by South Africa  women  children and the elderly have no defence  and our basic infrastructure  such as roads  bridges  railroads  hospitals  schools and industrial plants  is not spared; these are indeed the preferred targets of the South African army and its UNITA auxiliary forces.The damage suffered by our country as a result of the atrocities committed by the South African regular army and the UNITA puppets is estimated today at more than $US 12 billion. That figure does not include lost earnings resulting from the fact that our young people are engaged in military service  instead of attending school or working in factories where they would be contributing to increasing production and improving the living standard of our population.After achieving independence at the cost of great sacrifices our people aspire to life in peace and the reconstruction of their country; they wish to build a strong nation by exploiting the vast natural potential of our soil.Contrary to what some of the media would have international public opinion believe  there is no civil war in our country  it is in fact a case of foreign invasion of a State Member of the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  part of whose territory remains occupied by the racist South African troops. That is why the People's Republic of Angola continues to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from the southern part of its territory.South Africa is using Namibia's territory as a springboard for acts of aggression against Angolan territory. Thus South African military bases - where armed bandits and mercenaries are trained and later sent to our territory  and from where South African troops carry out incursions into our territory - are to be found in the north of occupied Namibia.In the face of these facts  and based on the rights recognized under international law and the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter  particularly Article 51 the Government of the People's Republic of Angola has appealed for assistance from friendly countries  in particular Cuba and the Soviet Union - assistance for which we wish once again to express our gratitude.Nevertheless  aware of the complexity of the situation in southern Africa and in order to remove the impasse created by South Africa and its allies with regard to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)   the Government of the People's Republic of Angola submitted an approach to global negotiations contained in its letter  dated 17 November 1984  addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  by the President of the People's Republic of Angola  Mr. Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.Despite this gesture of understanding and goodwill on the part of the Angolan Government  the plan for the independence of Namibia still faces the intransigence of the Government of South Africa and its allies.Once again  in a spirit of co-operation and openness  ray Government very recently proposed to the parties concerned  the general framework for a comprehensive agreement on the settlement of the Namibian question  a solution taking into account not only the legitimate right of the people of Namibia - under the leadership of its sole  genuine representative  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) - to self-determination and independence  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1970)   but also the right of the other countries of the region to live in peace and security. The agreement would be signed by the representatives of the Governments of Angola  Cuba and South Africa and of SWAPO  under the auspices of the Security Council or its permanent members.Moreover  the recent talks held in Luanda between representatives of the Angolan Government and the United States Administration clearly show my Government's constant readiness to seek a solution to the problems of peace and security in southern Africa. It is now up to the regime of South Africa and the United States Administration to accept or reject this new olive branch. If they persist in their obstinacy  history will judge them  for in wanting to link the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to the withdrawal of the internationalist Cuban troops from Angola the South African regime and its allies are simply invoking a cowardly and fallacious pretext to prevent the independence of Namibia and allow South Africa to continue using its territory as a base for aggression against and the destabilization of the People's Republic of Angola and other States of southern Africa  thus interfering with our efforts for national reconstruction.Twenty years have now elapsed since the establishment of the United Nations Council for Namibia. But we must note that implementation of its mandate is being obstructed by the intransigence of the apartheid regime. Such behaviour is possible only because of the support and encouragement that some Western countries continue to give it. In view of the illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African regime  the international community must now adopt firm measures to ensure that international legal order is restored.In South Africa we are witnessing extremely violent confrontations between the power of the white racist minority on the one hand and the oppressed and exploited black people on the other hand. New facts  however  have recently surfaced. Some elements of the white minority are beginning to understand that only a policy of dialogue and harmony can avoid a bloodbath with unforeseeable consequences. Thus  a delegation of white South Africans met with a delegation of the African National Congress (ANC) in Senegal. This is one more proof that many members of the white minority recognize the role of the ANC in the solution of the problem of South Africa. The People's Republic of Angola commends the courageous action of that group of South African citizens who have dared to defy the repressive power of apartheid. We feel that such initiatives open the way to a peaceful solution in South Africa and should be encouraged.Unfortunately  despite these positive steps  the present political picture within South Africa remains sombre. The racist regime continues to use oppression as its main weapon against the patriots of South Africa  as was the case in the recent cruel repression of the striking miners  who were seeking fair wages and the satisfaction of their just social claims. This alarming situation in South Africa presents a greater challenge than ever before to the international community  which should without further delay tackle the root causes of these phenomena that are endangering regional and international security and stability. The total elimination of apartheid and the end of the illegal occupation of Namibia must therefore be demanded.Consequently  the Government of the People's Republic of Angola believes that comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter should be imposed as a form of pressure on the racist South African Government It is disquieting to note that despite some encouraging signs the international situation continues to be darkened by the persistence of various other hotbeds of tension.On the African continent the Western Sahara conflict continues to affect the lives of the people of the territory. We believe that the implementation of resolution AHG/104 of the 19th Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) would make a great contribution to the settlement of the conflict. We therefore appeal to the parties concerned to continue the dialogue begun through the intermediary of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Concerning Chad  we hope that peace will be restored in that country in the interest of well-being and social progress of its people.The Middle East  where the State of Israel continues to carry out its aggressive expansionist policies against the Arab people  is another source of serious concern for us. We reaffirm the sacred and inalienable right of the Palestinian people  under the enlightened leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO)  to form their own State. We thus support the idea of convening an international conference on the Palestinian problem  with the participation of the PLO  and hope that this session can take the relevant measures to bring this about as rapidly as possible.We advocate respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon and the safeguarding of its independence  and we oppose foreign interference in the internal affairs of that State.The war between Iran and Iraq cannot fail to concern us  too  since it is a war between two non-aligned countries that seriously threatens international peace and security. We hope for an early end to that war.We also note with great concern that the question of East Timor remains deadlocked. We call for a dialogue between Indonesia and Portugal  with the mediation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  to find a just and lasting solution that takes into account the interests and rights of the Maubere people. The situation in the Korean peninsula is also a source of alarm for us. We welcome the initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the reunification of the great homeland of the Koreans and cannot support the admission of the two parties separately to the great family of the United Nations. We welcome with great satisfaction the initiatives of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea with regard to its policy of national reconciliation and are convinced that these will contribute to peace and stability in the region.In Latin America  we welcome the positive results achieved by the Heads of State of the five Central American countries - Nicaragua  Honduras  Costa Rica  El Salvador and Guatemala - at their last meeting and hope that these results will contribute to peace and thereby reduce instances of foreign interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region.We condemn the policy of intimidation  aggression  blackmail and economic blockade directed against Cuba and advocate the immediate cessation of the occupation of the Guantanamo base.We reaffirm our support for the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence  in accordance with resolution 1514 (XV) and the Declaration adopted by the Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Harare  Zimbabwe  last year.The world economic situation has hardly improved since the last session of the General Assembly  and the economic and financial crisis has become established and taken root in all the developing countries. The growing indebtedness is preventing those countries from carrying out their national recovery plans and becoming  as a result  an additional factor of instability and insecurity.The absence of the political will on the part of some developed countries to respond to the appeals of the international community  the arms race and the political instability created in some regions have helped to make the imbalance already existing in international economic relations even worse. The present structural crisis is also the result of the anachronistic development of the world economic system  which is shown by the fact that some countries are becoming ever richer  while the overwhelming majority of countries are becoming ever poorer and lack the means with which to tackle the problems of under development.The foreign debt is the clearest indicator of the scope and gravity of the world economic crisis. To deal with this  political effort and will are necessary not only on the part of the developing countries  which are at present the most affected  but also and above all on the part of the developed countries.The Government of the People's Republic of Angola continues to advocate the establishment of a new international economic order as an effective tool for overcoming the crisis and restoring balance to international economic relations.With regard to the present financial and monetary system  we feel that our action should be oriented towards its restructuring as quickly as possible so that the developing countries can participate in the taking of decisions and profit as much as possible thereby. Scrupulous respect by the developed countries  for the principles  rules and norms in force in this area would also contribute to avoiding deterioration of the situation and exacerbation of the crisisThe proliferation of discriminatory measures imposed by the developed countries in their trade with the developing countries  protectionism and other restrictive measures are resulting in the reduction of the earnings from products exported by the developing countries and a consequent reduction in the resources and funds available for development. However  all these measures required of the developed countries should not prevent the developing countries from themselves taking steps to restructure the management of their economies in such a way as to facilitate the task of those of the rich countries that wish to help them to overcome the crisis. My country has just taken various measures along those lines. In this context  the People's Republic of Angola reaffirms the importance of the ratification by both developed and developing countries of the Integrated Programme for Commodities  dealt with in resolution 93 (IV) of the fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IV)   and its Fund in order to permit its rapid entry into force. We therefore welcome the Soviet Government's decision to subscribe to the Fund.In the context of co-operation  the People's Republic of Angola also reaffirms the role of economic co-operation between developing countries - South-South co-operation - as a means of promoting the rational and effective use of their human  material  financial and technological resources. In this context  co-operation between the States of southern Africa in the framework of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) has already yielded significant results in various sectors  as acknowledged by the regional Heads of State or Government at their last summit meeting in Lusaka.However  we recognize that much remains to be done. The convening by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) next December of a conference of Heads of State and Government devoted to the foreign debt of the African countries reflects the importance that our countries attach to this problem and the political will to combine their efforts to redress Africa's economic situation.In reviewing all these situations  we have tried to interpret in our own way the problems of peace and development and to express our desire for the progress and well-being of all mankind. In this context  we reaffirm our devotion to the principles of the United Nations and to multilateralism as a whole as an instrument for seeking solutions to the complex problems of a world that is growing more and more interdependent.The struggle continues. Victory is certain."
"3",103,"ALB",42,1987,"﻿Allow me  Sir  on behalf of the Albanian delegation  to extend to you my warm congratulations on your election to the high post of President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-second session and to wish you success in the performance of your task.Although more than four decades have elapsed since the founding of the United Nations  the international community is still very far from achieving those objectives and goals pertaining to peace that are clearly stipulated in the Charter and constitute the fundamental purpose for which this Organization was founded. The political situation in the world today presents a grave picture. Various peoples and countries continue to be threatened with aggression by imperialist forces or have been the victims of declared and undeclared imperialist wars - wars in which a number of States and millions of troops are involved  with resultant huge human losses and colossal material damage  and with serious consequences for international peace and security.In fact  the stationing of military troops by the United States of America and the Soviet Union indefinitely in the territory of many States has been legitimised under various pretexts  such as the threat from the East  or the West  and so on. Indeed  repeated meetings have been held  where there is talk about the maintenance of the balance of forces and military manoeuvres conducted alternately by one bloc or the other  but the most that is ever heard is satisfaction at the participation in them of observers from the two blocs  and there is never any talk of the complete withdrawal of American and Soviet troops from foreign territories where they are stationed. For the sake of co-ordinating policies in the context of blocs  even the taking of independent decisions has been restricted  and made virtually impossible. All the political activity of the two super-Powers  whether in the bilateral talks between blocs or in a broader framework  has concentrated on maintaining  and indeed extending  their respective spheres of Influence. This impermissible situation of undeclared occupation in modern times cannot but remind us of the long-drawn-out invasions of past centuries and the lessons of history.We hear a lot of talk at present about the United States and the Soviet Union reaching an agreement on the removal of medium-range missiles from Europe. From the very outset the Albanian Government has expressed its opposition to the deployment of these missiles in Europe  just as it has always been and still is in favour of the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons  and against the miniaturization of space and the arms race in general. It is a well-known fact that when the two super-Powers installed those missiles  they paid no attention to the strong opposition of the peoples of Europe. Now they are talking about dismantling and removing them from Europe  and are trying to present this as an important step in the field of disarmament. It is abundantly clear that in this whole business the super-Powers have made their calculations. When they speak about international security  they are in fact talking only about their own security  which means insecurity for the others. Even after such an agreement  thousands of nuclear weapons  regardless of type  will still remain in and around Europe and hundreds of military bases established in a number of European States will still be there. Hence  the factors that threaten peace on the continent and in the world remain. Thus an agreement  on the removal of short- and medium-range missiles must absolutely be accompanied by other steps in the field of disarmament  and that would constitute a victory for the peoples and democratic States that are continuing to fight against the arms race as they have been fighting for years. For some time  especially in recent years  much has been said about summit meetings between the United States and the Soviet Union in the hope that they would solve the problems of safeguarding peace and assuring the future of mankind. For the super-Powers to meet and hold talks is their right and business  but what is unacceptable is that they should discuss and take decisions for others. It would be dangerous if peoples were to accept the institutionalisation of summit meetings between the super-Powers as a forum empowered to take decisions for third parties. The super-Powers would like to be given a free hand and have other States welcome and accept as fait accompli everything they decide.The Albanian delegation believes that on issues connected with the destinies of peoples  with world peace and security  every sovereign State must have its say.The problems of Europe and European security are of direct concern to socialist Albania. Peace on the continent  friendly relations among European peoples and countries signify peace and normal development also for the People's Socialist Republic of Albania. Our people  which throughout the centuries have suffered from wars and foreign invasions  have been and continue to be in the vanguard of those fighting for peace and friendship among peoples.But who and what threatens European security? Who and what jeopardizes peace on this continent? Europe has been shackled hand and foot with heavy fetters. It is the military pacts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and of the Warsaw Treaty  the military bases and arsenals of nuclear and conventional weapons deployed in so many countries  the armies of the United States and of the Soviet Union which  for more than the 40 years that have elapsed since the Second World War  continue to make themselves at home in Europe; it is the warships  cruisers and aircraft carriers of the super-Powers which criss-cross the Mediterranean and European waters like sea serpents; it is imperialist economic and political pressure and cultural aggression which is stifling the continent. It is precisely this that is undermining the sovereignty of various countries  affecting their personalities and independence and endangering peace and security in Europe.Albania does not participate in the meetings of the Conference on European Security and Co-operation  for we are convinced that these meetings  which are manipulated by the two super-Powers  cannot lead to any fruitful results unless one believes that the United States and the Soviet Union are going to frustrate their own ends. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania  which under its Constitution prohibits foreign military bases and troops on its territory and which has solemnly declared that no harm will ever come to any of its neighbours from Albanian territory  appreciates the genuine aspirations of peoples  honest men and progressive personalities in Europe to peace and security in our continent  and we welcome their efforts in that direction.However  the Albanian Government has always been firmly convinced that European security cannot be achieved through such meetings and conferences where the super-Powers impose their will. European security can be achieved only by getting rid of the chains with which the two super-Powers have shackled it and by opposing their presence and interference in the internal  affairs of European States. Only thus can their freedom  independence and sovereignty be guaranteed.Also  the Balkan region does not enjoy tranquillity  neither is it without problems. In addition to interference by the super-Powers  there are a number of negative regional elements that have increased tension. It is common knowledge that history has intermingled the peoples of the Balkans and that there are many ethnic minorities. Regrettably  in recent years chauvinistic feuds and passions have been incited in one way or another. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania is opposed to these dangerous trends. It cannot reconcile itself to acts and deeds that restrict the national rights of the peoples of the Balkans  or that divide them and sow hostility among them  it advocates respect for the rights of every people and each ethnic minority.The Albanian Government believes that minorities should be viewed as a bridge to unity and friendship among the peoples of the peninsula and not as a source of discord. Acceptance and recognition of their identities  cultures and national traditions and respect for their own languages and their spiritual bonds with their own nation would greatly contribute to strengthening an atmosphere of understanding and sincere co-operation.From time to time initiatives are taken regarding various political activities and meetings at the Balkan level. The Albanian Government appreciates every sincere and constructive step aimed at serving peace and stability in the region. Hence we support in principle the holding of bilateral and multilateral meetings and talks. At the same time we believe that it is necessary first to create the kind of atmosphere that will ensure their making a contribution towards genuine solutions of the problems of our region and not their becoming a source of further exacerbation of the situation.For its part Albania has acted with a high sense of its responsibility and has never been the cause for any exacerbation of the situation. It favours the removal of nuclear and chemical weapons and so on  not only from the Balkans but also from other regions and countries. That is in keeping with its political line. Also  Albania has realized in practice what the Balkans need to ensure peace and understanding.Friendly Balkan co-operation is the hope and aspiration of the peoples of the region  but to achieve this it is necessary to face up realistically to the problems of the peninsula. We believe that at present it would be advantageous to each country and to the region as a whole to settle existing differences by means of bilateral negotiations  just as it would be equally necessary to develop bilateral relations. We believe also that inter-Balkan activities in the fields o trade  transport  culture  science and technology  ecology and so on help to develop co-operation and strengthen trust and understanding  which are so indispensable for the concerted consideration of the major political problems of the Balkans.The problems of security in the Balkans and in Europe are closely connected with those of security in the Mediterranean. For years this basin has been transformed into an arena of rivalry between the super-Powers  which have deployed their fleets there thousands of kilometres from their own borders and are threatening the peoples and the peace of the region. Their growing presence and activities keep the Mediterranean peoples and countries in a state of continuous tension. The anchoring of American and Soviet cruisers and other warships  which in the guise of ""friendly"" or ""tourist"" visits have secured permanent access to port services and facilities in various countries  also constitutes a real danger to neighbouring countries.The worsening of the situation and the continuation of the crisis in the Middle East and the repeated American military operations in the western Mediterranean and so forth is eloquent evidence of the urgent need to oppose the military presence of the super-Powers in the Mediterranean with their bases and fleets. Albania continues to maintain the view that  their removal constitutes the primary and decisive pre-condition for turning the Mediterranean into a sea of peace. For years now the tense situation in the Middle East  with its almost regular flare-ups  has been a constant threat to international relations.To the terrible tragedy of the Palestinian people  who have long been the victims of genocide like that carried out by the Nazis against the Jews during the Second World War  has now been added the drama and the tragic events in Lebanon  which has been turned into an arena of fratricidal strife whipped up by the imperialist Powers and Israel  and all those that are playing their game. Irrespective of the political groupings or religious sects of those engaged in the present fighting  it is Arab blood that continues to be shed in Lebanon and it is the Arab cause in general and the Palestinian cause in particular that are constantly under attack.The People's Socialist Republic of Albania and the Albanian people  sincere friends of the Arab peoples  with whom they are linked by traditional bonds  are saddened by the events in Lebanon  which we follow with concern  just as we follow the overall developments and crisis in the Middle East. We rejoice at every step towards Arab unity  just as we welcome whole-heartedly any positive development towards the strengthening of the unity in the ranks of the Palestinian movement  of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).Recently there has been talk  which continues  of convening an international conference on the Middle East. We believe that no conference on this question can yield results if it ignores or seeks a substitute for the PLO. Still less can be expected from such a conference if it fails to deal with the very heart of the Middle East problem  the Palestinian problem.The Middle East and Gulf areas have been transformed into permanent hotbeds of war  and the imperialist Powers bear a grave responsibility for this. The continuance of the Iran-Iraq war has caused incalculable human losses and material damage to the peoples of the two countries. The war benefits only the enemies of those countries and of peace  who one day may use it as a pretext to in the flames of war not just throughout the Gulf but beyond. The United States and other Powers have now sent their battle fleets to the Gulf on the pretext of guaranteeing freedom of navigation and clearing the waters of mines. This sets n extremely dangerous precedent. The guns in the Straits of Hormuz have made the situation even more explosive. Battle fleets were sent there before the ink was even dry on resolution 598 (19B7) which the Security Council adopted unanimously calling on all other States to refrain from any act which might lead to further escalation and widening of the Iran-Iraq conflict.It is now more essential than ever for the sincere appeals of democratic and peace-loving States  which represent the voice of reason and sound international opinion  for an immediate end to the war to be heeded. This would be in the interest of both Iraq and Iran and of the peace and stability of the region and the world.A number of hotbeds of tension are being kept alight and fanned by imperialism and reaction in other areas of the world  such as Africa  Central America and South-East Asia.Contrary to the will of the Korean people  Korea continues to be divided. The Albanian Government supports the right of the Korean people to the independent reunification of its country without any outside interference.The People's Republic of Kampuchea is not being left in peace to build a new and independent life  and is still denied its lawful place in the United Nations. Peoples everywhere - whether in the occupied Arab territories  Nicaragua  Afghanistan  Namibia or South Africa - are stepping up their patriotic resistance to foreign aggression and interference. They are intensifying the anti-imperialist struggle  along with the struggle against racial discrimination and apartheid  for their democratic and national rights.Current political developments cannot be viewed in isolation from the effects of the prolonged economic and financial crisis and the intensification of neo-colonial exploitation. An indication of the degree of exploitation and injustice in existing international economic relations is the fact that 50 per cent of our planet's raw material resources are utilized by the industrialized countries  although  of course  they make up only 15 per cent of the population of the world. The developing countries are up to their necks in debt and the repayment conditions imposed have become impossible to meet; in fact  the economies of many States are being stifled. International trade is encountering difficulties of many kinds  as was clearly confirmed at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Similarly  the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development brought to light new facts about the paradoxical and tragic situation of the world today. The colossal sum expended on arms is equal to the total debt. Yet the production of all types of weapons continues unabated  as does the arms trade.The peoples and the developing countries are exerting every effort to fight the system of neo-colonial relations imposed by the imperialist Powers. We associate ourselves with the efforts to change the inequality of international economic relations. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania has always been and remains in favour of the development of international relations on a basis of justice and mutual advantage. In the future  too  we shall continue to participate actively in these relations. This we consider to be both a right deriving from our status as an independent and sovereign State and a duty deriving from the policy of a truly socialist country. The Albanian Government believes that development and international co-operation in various fields must contribute to the strengthening of friendship among peoples and strengthening of peace and security.The Albanian people and Government  as in the past  will continue in the future to give its unreserved support to the struggle of peoples for freedom and national independence  which is one of the fundamental trends of world development at the present time and a contribution to the cause of peace  freedom and democracy."
"4",171,"ARE",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates  I am pleased to extend to the President our congratulations on his election to his office at this forty-second session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that with his ability  wisdom and experience he will fulfil his task with great efficiency and distinction.I would also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation and thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Huroayun Choudhury  for his able leadership and distinguished contributions to the work of the previous session - a session during which the United Nations faced one of its most challenging problems. On this occasion I should like to stress once again our confidence in the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and our deep appreciation of the steps he has undertaken to bolster the Organization  and also of the efforts and initiatives he has put forth to solve existing problems and disputes through peaceful means.In his latest report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General stated from the outset that greater solidarity among nations had been evident in handling serious problems with global implications throughout the past year. We observed: ""This can provide a promising basis for broadened multilateral co-operation and increased effectiveness of the United Nations."" (Л/42/1  pt2| While we share this hope and this vision with the Secretary-General  we should like to point out that this year has been characterized by international multilateral actions aimed at settling conflicts through diplomacy or through resort to United Nations organs. We therefore urge that this method be reinforced and that it be given more momentum in order that we may achieve what we all yearn for: international peace and security on the basis of justice  and the attainment of the rights of all people without discrimination.Far from being new  our call is based on the principles and convictions that guide the foreign policy of our country. Foremost among these is our commitment to the United Nations Charter  our support for the United Nations organs  and our unshakeable belief in the peaceful settlement of conflicts between States.Our very nature makes our commitment to the Charter even firmer. Being a small developing country  we believe that adherence to the principles of the Charter by all States  especially those which have special international responsibilities  is the only effective guarantee of our security. Because of our experience as a non-permanent member of the Security Council  we cannot but emphasize the need to strengthen the system of collective security and enhance the role of the United Nations  including use of the Security Council on a more regular basis and resort to it for preventive measures. Moreover  we should make use of the Council as a forum for negotiations on outstanding international problems. The Council should also convene at the highest possible level in order to discuss at length  and with fairness and detachment  the causes underlying the United Nations failure to implement the functions provided for in the Charter. These functions embody the essence of international organization  in that they reflect the desire of the international community to have a world in which equality and justice reign supreme  unhampered by war and armed conflicts.The Iran-Iraq war has entered its eighth year. Far from abating  the war has expanded over the past twelve months or so in a manner that has ramifications not only for the two warring parties but for others also. Military fleets and vessels are as numerous and ubiquitous in the Gulf waters as commercial vessels. If this portends anything  it is the danger that threatens international shipping  and the feeling of fear and tension engendered by the spiralling escalation of the war. The events of the last few days should serve as a stern warning of other battles that may erupt/ with inestimable and uncontrollable results.This tragic development gave rise to lengthy negotiations and to concerted efforts with a view to containing the ongoing war by pursuing a political settlement. Finally  international efforts bore fruit and the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 598 (1987). Jointly with other members  notably the non-aligned States  my country participated in the efforts that led to the adoption of that resolution. Not only is the resolution balanced  but it also takes into account .the legitimate interests of the two parties in the conflict. Like the other members of the Security Council and the world in general  we believe that Security Council resolution 598 (1987) outlines an integrated approach to ending the war and settling all outstanding problems between the two warring parties by peaceful means. Furthermore  the resolution represents a unique  historic opportunity for a peaceful and just settlement of the conflict. We strongly urge everyone to take this opportunity.The Secretary-General's visit to Iran and Iraq  coupled with his tireless efforts and the discussions he had with the two patties  enhanced the hope of a political settlement. Needless to say  we are fully aware of how much needs to be done to achieve the objectives that we all cherish. Although we stress the need for maintaining the unified position of the members of the Security Council  we do not believe that this should be at the expense of the implementation of the resolution. In our view  both are of great importance. My country has always been prepared to contribute to all political efforts to bring about a just and peaceful settlement that will safeguard the legitimate interests of the two parties. We have participated in efforts of this nature through different channels. Our efforts in this direction will continue  because peace is a noble cause.We reject the use of holy shrines for political propaganda  as happened recently in the case of the holy mosque of Mecca Al Mokarama. We also reject the dragging in of parties that have nothing to do with the war  as happened recently with the acts of aggression against our sister State  Kuwait.With regard to the Middle East  to say that the situation there is at a standstill would be an understatement. Indeed  things have gone from bad to worse. The Israeli forces of occupation are still on Arab land. The Palestinian people are still living in forced exile  scattered all over the world and barred from exercising their rights. As far as the tragedy of Palestine is concerned  this year evokes painful memories. Exactly 70 years ago a declaration was made without Palestinian consent. This was the Balfour Declaration  the landmark in the process which led to the emergence of the Zionist State. This year  40 years have passed since the partition resolution was adopted by the General Assembly. That resolution  which led to the creation of Israel against the backdrop of special international circumstances  was a travesty of law and justice. This year  1987  also marks the passage of 20 years since Israel completed the usurpation of Palestine and conquered parts of the neighbouring Arab countries.While we may speak with optimism about the progress achieved this year with regard to international co-operation in the field of the peaceful settlement of conflicts  we can hardly do the same when it comes to the Middle East. All initiatives and attempts to break the stalemate on Middle East problems and the Palestine question have foundered. The prospects of a peaceful and honourable settlement ate as bleak as ever  despite the almost universal consensus on the need to convene an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations  as stipulated in resolution· 38/58 G  and despite the efforts of the Secretary-General. In the words of the Secretary-General:""Unfortunately  it has not yet proved possible to obtain the agreement of all the parties to the principle of an international conference..."" (A/42/1  p. 3) We all know who supports the principle of a peace conference and who does not. So far  Israel and its supporters have resorted to stalling tactics and procrastination.We wish to underscore once more the right of the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization  to participate on an equal footing in any effort to find to a just solution of the Middle East conflict. As we all know  the Palestine problem lies at the heart of this conflict and  a priori  a Middle East peace conference should be convened on the basis of this principle.In Lebanon  Israel persists in its defiance of the will of the international community. It still occupies parts of Lebanese territory in violation of numerous United Nations resolutions  including Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982)  which explicitly call on Israel to withdraw forthwith and unconditionally. In addition Israel interferes directly in internal Lebanese affairs and continues its attacks against Lebanese towns and villages by land  sea and air.We salute the heroic struggle of the Lebanese resistance against the forces of Israeli occupation  but at the same time we appeal to our brothers in Lebanon to settle their differences and close their ranks so that Lebanon may regain its strength and ensure its freedom and Independence.The situation in southern Africa and the absence of a peaceful settlement there arouse our utmost concern. The reasons for this stalemate are not hard to pinpoint. The white racist minority Government of South Africa tenaciously holds to its apartheid ideology and practices in an attempt to perpetuate its position of dominance and socio-economic affluence. It deprives Namibia of its independence  and employs its war machine in acts of aggression against the African front-line States.We strongly deplore the system of apartheid of the racist regime in Pretoria  which denies the basic rights of the black majority population  in violation of the principles of the Charter  international law and justice. We also deplore the stalling tactics used by the apartheid regime to prevent the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which provides for Namibia's independence. We oppose with equal vigour the attempts to establish a linkage between the implementation of that resolution and external issues that concern the sovereignty of a neighbouring State  Our support for the noble struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People'sOrganization (SWAPO)  is as firm as ever. Victory  freedom and independence  we believe  are the fruits that the Namibian people will reap. My country strongly condemns the continued acts of aggression  terrorism and destabilization perpetrated by the Pretoria regime against neighbouring African States.Guided by the principle which governs our position with regard to South Africa  my country has always endorsed the draft resolutions submitted to the Security Council with a view to the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions against the apartheid regime. This  we believe  is the ideal course of action to force Pretoria to abandon its policy of apartheid.The central principle underlying the establishment of the United Nations is the preservation of international peace and security to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which in the- life-span of one generation had twice inflicted on humanity untold sorrow and pain. That goal will continue to elude us for as long as the arms race persists and the stockpiling of nuclear and conventional weapons continues unabated. It is disarmament on the basis of balanced military reductions that holds the promise of establishing the edifice of peace and preventing war. In view of this  we welcome the recent agreement between the two super-Powers on the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear missiles and consider it to be an important step on the road to disarmament. We sincerely hope that the forthcoming super-Power summit meeting will help to accelerate this process. 	In this regard we wish to encourage once again the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones  in particular in the Middle East  We also reiterate our support for and commitment to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  adopted by the United Nations.I have outlined in my opening remarks the principles which guide and regulate our foreign policy with respect to international problems. Among the most important are the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries  the non-use of force or the threat of force and the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means.We therefore call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and urge all outside parties not to interfere in the country's internal affairs. The people of Afghanistan should be allowed to choose for themselves the system of government that they desire. We are encouraged by the reports which suggest that the gap between the conflicting parties is narrowing. The same applies to Kampuchea  whose people have long suffered from the aggression and interference of outside Powers It also applies to the crisis-ridden region of Central America  As far as this region is concerned  we support the regional agreement signed on 7 August 1987 by the Presidents of El Salvador  Guatemala  Costa Rica  Nicaragua and Honduras. That agreement contains the principal elements necessary for achieving a stable and permanent peace in Central America.Concerning Korea  we urge the north and the south to settle their differences: through free dialogue unhampered by pressure and pre-conditions. This should defuse the crisis and bring about the unity that the Koreans so earnestly seek. We also hope that the Secretary-General will proceed with his mediation efforts so that the differences between the two parties may be overcome. With regard to Cyprus  we ate saddened by the setback in the attempts to solve this problem. As the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization indicates the state of affairs in Cyprus gives increasing cause for concern ... The possibility of serious confrontations cannot be excluded in the months ahead if present trends continue."" (A/42/1  p. 6)We hope that the Secretary-General will continue his efforts to bring the points of view of the Turkish and Greek communities closer together. The ultimate objective is the achievement of a just  comprehensive and permanent settlement within whose framework security and coexistence will be ensured for the two communities. Such a settlement should also guarantee justice and equal rights for the two communities  as well as the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the Federal Republic of Cyprus.On the international economic horizon the picture is dismal and uncertain. The world economy has slowed down considerably since the first half of the 1980s. Earlier events in 1986 and the first half of 1987 have failed to restore resiliency to the world economy and foster faster  stable growth. Last year's collapse of the price of oil and the steep fall in the value of the United States dollar have not produced the desired results. On the contrary  they have caused concern regarding inflationary expectations and the consequent rise in the interest rates in the industrialized world  weakening further the efforts of the debtor nations to lighten their burdens. Uncertainty over trade deficits in some key industrialized countries have triggered protectionist sentiments  causing anxiety concerning the developing countries' exports. It is important to note here that world prices for primary commodities are at their lowest level in 50 years. As a result  per capita incomes  in the developing countries are at their lowest level in the present decade. At the centre of this bleak picture lie the world economy's three most pressing problems; exchange rate volatility  protectionism and the debts of the developing countries. They are all closely linked. A high degree of uncertainty with regard to these problems has caused a crisis of confidence among investors  leading to a deterioration in the world economic outlook.The present situation inevitably gives rise to the question of the ability of the existing international system to cope with these strains. In view of all this  we believe that the existing economic order is not conducive to balanced and equitable development or to just relations of equality among States.We emphasize that an expansive world economy and sustained economic growth are essential ingredients of the solution of the many complex problems that face the world community. Therefore renewed commitment by all nations and the revival of the North-South dialogue are necessary as the basis for restoring stability to the global economy.We must therefore continue the efforts aimed at restructuring international economic relations on the basis of justice  equality and mutual interest. To this end  the industrial countries must demonstrate a positive attitude and undertake serious negotiations with the developing countries to promote the cause of development. We believe that it is the responsibility of those countries with the greatest influence on the world trade and finance markets to remedy the disarray in the world economy.The solution of world economic problems will require large and often painful changes in the domestic policies of all countries. It is imperative that the major actors in the world economy overcome their preoccupation with domestic problems  internal disputes over trade and macro-economic problems in the common interest of all nations and the world economy in general. The United Nations reflects the hopes and expectations of the peoples of the world for the establishment of a world public order free from wars and confrontations  multilateral or bilateral  and based on the maintenance of peace and security and the realization of justice and equality. In order to achieve these noble goals  the Charter prescribed organs and mechanisms whose functions and achievements depend on solidarity and multilateral co-operation among all States. Several States  especially those with primary responsibilities  have disregarded these facts  which has resulted in a world order that is not in line with the hopes and expectations of those who drafted the Charter. Over the past year signs of a promising means of broadened multilateral coo-operation and the utilization of United Nations machinery has started to emerge. Now that a start has been made to move from the sad realities of the past to the promising signs of the present  we hope that in the future those encouraging signs will be transformed into practical realities  thus making our future brighter and more secure.

"5",218,"ARG",42,1987,"﻿My first words are words of congratulation to you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the Presidency of the General Assembly. The delegation of Argentina is pleased to have supported the election of the Bureau. Let me assure you that we will co-operate with you in your efforts so that the forty-second session of the General Assembly may contribute to the solution of the problems facing mankind.At the same time I wish to acknowledge the wisdom with which my distinguished colleague Mr. Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury fulfilled his duties.I wish also to express our congratulations to Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed in his new duties as under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. From this rostrum  we often warn about the serious crises that affect our planet and we call attention to the misunderstandings and conflicts that threaten the harmony of mankind.I believe that in 1987 we must begin recognizing the progress towards peace that has taken place in the world. One fact suffices to explain my statement  which is also the reason for my hope - the recent historic understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union concerning the dismantling of short- and medium-range missiles in Europe. It is the first time since the development of nuclear weapons that an effective commitment to disarmament has been initiated. The fact that common sense has prevailed in the relationship between the major ' Powers is  I believe  the event of the greatest political importance to affect the planet in recent decades.All members of the international community have an important role to play in this regard. Nuclear disarmament is undoubtedly a priority task  which cannot be delayed  with that conviction  the leaders of Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden  Tanzania and Argentina are actively pursuing the initiative for peace and disarmament known as the Group of Six  which since its inception has postulated the adoption of decisions that might halt and reverse the nuclear arms race.In the multilateral sphere  we feel encouraged by the progress evidenced in the disarmament conference towards achieving a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. We hope to see that convention materialize in the near future  on a non-discriminatory basis. There is thus evidence in the world of a greater willingness to have recourse to negotiation as the proper way of approaching the solution of conflicts. Such an attitude must obviously be encouraged by all means - among these  our Organization  the United Nations  provides an ideal framework for the development of negotiations and understandings  in that sense  my Government wishes to stress the tireless activity of our Secretary-General  whose efforts to make the United Nations the most valuable element for peace available to us are widely recognized and appreciated. His work is a source of legitimate pride for his country - so dear to us Argentines - and for our regional group  from which he was chosen.In its participation in the Security Council Argentina is inspired by its desire to make a concrete and effective contribution to the strengthening of the United Nations. Through our votes  and our participation in general  in the Security Council we have in view the consolidation of the system set forth in the Charter  convinced as we are that small and medium-sized countries may contribute significantly to the maintenance of international peace and security.In that light  we have considered various international conflicts  some of them  such as the war between Iran and Iraq and the questions of southern Africa and the Middle East  are obvious and exert daily pressure on the international conscience through their manifestations of destruction and death. Others  such as terrorism and drug trafficking  constitute a more subtle and less orthodox  but none the less dangerous  form of violence.As regards the armed conflict between Iraq and Iran  we have achieved  with the agreement reached among the 15 members of the Security Council  which led to the adoption of resolution 598 (1987)  an instrument that allows us to act  to mediate and to promote conditions would allow both countries to safeguard their vital interests  preserve their national honour and dignity  and  above all  regain peace. But we are seriously concerned by the events that have taken place since the adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). That is why  in the view of the Argentine Government  immediate compliance with a cease-fire is necessary as the primary and indispensable condition for achieving the objectives set forth in resolution 598 (1987).The main challenge is  indeed  to achieve peace  but it also seems appropriate to state that we face another challenge - that of demonstrating the effectiveness of our Organization and  in particular  of its Security Council. Accordingly  my Government believes that  without ever putting aside the exercise of political restraint  the Security Council should - if circumstances so require - intensify the search for machinery that might ensure the effective implementation of resolution 598 (1987).Also among the many promising signs this year is the fact that the two Koreas are analysing proposals for reducing armaments and troops and are considering the possibility of signing a non-aggression pact. We must likewise call attention to the meeting of the German leaders as another element favouring the reduction of tension.Among these encouraging events  the Latin American countries would  obviously  also wish to emphasize the development of the situation in Central America. It would be hard to enumerate all the meetings  contacts  proposals and negotiations carried out by the Foreign Ministers of the Contadora Group and the Support Group. Today  we can say that nothing seems to have been in vain  that no effort has been useless. But for that to be so  if peace again becomes possible it will undoubtedly be due to the political will of the five Central American countries whose Presidents  resolutely confronting the regional crisis  signed the Guatemala agreement on 7 August last with a view to working out fundamental solutions with regard to security  the consolidation of institutions  and social and economic development. The Argentine Government continues to be firmly committed to its support of a lasting peace in Central America and has given evidence of that will in a practical way through Its participation in the mechanism for the verification and follow-up of the Guatemala agreements drawn up at Caracas on 22 August.There Is therefore cause for rejoicing that peace in Central America appears possible  but we must also be aware that although the progress achieved is substantial  the situation remains fragile. No political will  no diplomatic skill  can ensure peace without self-determination  non-interference  pluralistic democracy and economic development. And we are all well aware how difficult it is to bring about these conditions. It is therefore essential that the entire international community co-operate in order to create the basic conditions for peace in Central America. If we rejoice at peace  if we search for it and preach it  let us all share the responsibility for its attainment.The situation In the Middle East continues to be unstable and dangerous. We consider it imperative to continue to explore all feasible formulas for obtaining a just  honourable and equitable peace. We are convinced that this will become possible only if the solution Includes recognition  at the same time  of the Inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to live in their own territory - with the authorities and forms of government they freely choose - and the rights of all States of the region - obviously including Israel - to live within internationally recognized boundaries. In that context  the convening of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation and approval of all parties  would represent a definite step forward. With regard to the critical scene in the Middle East we continue to follow with particular concern the situation in Lebanon  and we feel it is necessary to step up efforts to ensure that Lebanon may recover its full territorial sovereignty and exercise its inalienable right to live free of all foreign interference.The growing deterioration of the situation in southern Africa and the problems of that region have a common cause in South Africa's persistent refusal to abide by the decisions of the United Nations. The continuation of the apartheid regime constitutes one of the worst and most urgent of today's problems. Argentina reiterates its solidarity with the oppressed people of South Africa and its rejection of the Pretoria regime  whose inflexibility endangers international peace and security.In addition  the Government of South Africa continues to occupy Illegally the Territory of Namibia. It is imperative that progress be made towards the self-determination and Independence of the Namibian people. To that end  the Organization must fully assume its direct responsibility over the Territory  adopting the measures necessary for that purpose. In this connection  as in the question of apartheid  my country supports the adoption of mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter  since we view that as the most appropriate and effective means to establish justice and the principles of the Charter in southern Africa.Tense situations between States are often aggravated by acts of international terrorism. The General Assembly has unanimously condemned such criminal acts. We undertake to lend our support to the search for measures that would enable us to make co-operation in this area even more effective.Argentina also wishes to reaffirm in the General Assembly its support for the legitimate and just aspiration of the Republic of Bolivia to recover a direct outlet to the Pacific Ocean. We have followed with interest and attention the talks that took place at Montevideo and we hope that the spirit in which they were convened may be renewed in the search for a solution through negotiation and dialogue.The identification of our foreign policy with the principles and purposes of the United Nations is concretely evidenced In those subjects in which we are directly involved. Thus  with regard to the question of the Malvinas Islands  the Argentine Government Is firmly committed to the search of a peaceful and lasting settlement of the sovereignty dispute and related problems that at present exist between my country and the United Kingdom. In this context we have accepted General Assembly resolution 41/40  which requests both Governments to initiate negotiations with a view to finding the means to resolve peacefully and definitively the problems pending between both countries  including all aspects on the future of the Malvinas  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. It is worth recalling that that resolution received overwhelming support  which included close friends of the United Kingdom. That wide support confirms the genuine interest of the international community in finding a solution to the question of the Malvinas Islands.Unfortunately  that feeling of the international community has not been shared by the British Government  which has repeatedly rejected the idea of global negotiations without exclusions that may allow us to resolve the dispute between the two countries. The Argentine Republic  while reaffirming its sovereign rights over the Malvinas  South George and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding sea  also repeats its permanent willingness for dialogue  its decision to respect theinterests and life-style of the inhabitants of the Malvinas  guaranteeing their well being and prosperity  and its firm commitment to peace. In that sense ray Government expresses its permanent willingness to find mechanisms that may ensure peace in that region without altering in any manner its titles and claims over the islands.The Argentine Government expresses once more its gratitude for the mission of good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  in accordance with General Assembly resolutions  in the question of the Malvinas. My Government appreciates his efforts and is convinced that the Organization has an important role to play in the process of settling the dispute over the Islands.Turning to another area  my delegation is duty-bound to express its gratitude to the outstanding and noble task of the World Commission for the Environment  presided over by the Prime Minister of Norway. The relative reduction in world tension will enable us to devote greater efforts and resources to environmental conservation and to ensure a harmonious and sustained development. From that perspective  for example  the Malvinas region  which today is an area of tension  might  through appropriate solutions  become a region for co-operation and détente that would generate progress and development  with a priority concept of environmental conservation. Once the Argentine territorial claim has been answered  the South Atlantic might become a formidable experiment for co-operation and progress with an inestimable effect on the economies of the Malvinas and Patagonia.Today Latin America is confronting a triple challenge.In the first place  there is a challenge to recover and strengthen the democratic political system in places where it has not hitherto existed or where it had been allowed to lapse. The 1980s signalled the recovery of the founding ideals and values of our region. Our destiny is once more in the hands of our peoples. Nothing could be more encouraging for universal peace  because a democratic Latin America is a guarantee of stability and common sense for all the international community.In this new stage  in itself fragile because of the traces left by authoritarianism in Latin America  we are now confronted with a second challenge  the challenge of the threat of war in Central America  the consequences of which would undoubtedly affect the entire region. Contadora has shown that Latin America is capable of facing this second challenge  even at times when all hope seemed lost.Our region also faces a third challenge  that of resolving the crisis caused by the external debt and the distortion of the international economic and financial system. Our peoples and Governments have also shown their abilities and decisiveness vis-à-vis this challenge  which casts the darkest shadows over our future.The consequences of this crisis were defined with common sense and resolve in the Cartagena consensus  in which  with unprecedented courage  we initiated structural adjustment programmes that meant and continue to mean great sacrifices for our peoples.At the same time  we understand that we are facing a re-organization of international political and economic relations and  in spite of the narrow perspectives of the present day  we have made significant progress towards shaping a common regional space. This is evident  for example  in the creation of the so-called Rio Group which  at the forthcoming meeting of the eight Presidents to be held in Mexico  will take one more step towards the integration of Latin America. Consolidation of political systems  a concrete contribution to peace  compliance with the demands of an exorbitant and unfair debt  far-reaching economic restructuring  substantial progress towards integration - these  in short  are some of our achievements in response to that triple challenge. Nobody could reasonably expect so much; nobody could reasonably demand more of us.However  despite all this  our future is still dark. The present economic situation cannot continue without the chances of deep social crises  which would seriously affect all the progress that we have made. Latin America cannot and should not continue to subsidize the creditor countries as a net exporter of capital. Latin America cannot continue to be the victim of trade wars between the industrialized countries  which have caused an unprecedented fall in the prices of its traditional products  while markets are closed or lost because of the unfair competition created by subsidies. Common sense prevents us waiting passively for an end to that situation.A few figures suffice to show the magnitude of the Latin American economic problem. In the last five years alone the main countries of the region have produced a net transfer of capital to the developed world of about $150 billion  which represents an annual reduction of approximately 5 per cent in the investment capacity of our countries  whose investment levels are already below those needed for sustained growth.Those figures and that situation are applicable to all the other countries of Latin America  too  and we are sure that our Latin American brothers feel the same. We Argentines have no doubt that the main responsibility for change and growth in our country lies with the Argentine people themselves. Like all our Latin American brothers  we do not beg for help or shift on responsibility on the other shoulders. Having said this  we roust affirm that we have no doubt either how limited is the viability of our countries  however hard we try to achieve our own reforms  however much we reduce our concessions to legitimate social demands  however firmly we reject any demagogic temptation  as long as the present international situation persists. In present international conditions resulting from the debt and the restrictions on trade it will be very difficult to achieve the goal of strengthening democracy and securing an acceptable level of development.The majority of the industrialized countries  if not all  often show their solidarity when an authoritarian regime afflicts our nations; similarly  they rejoice when we Latin Americans return to democracy. It is high time for us to state clearly that we Latin Americans hope that we shall not again in the future need that solidarity in our misfortunes  not having found solidarity in our reconstruction. In that case it would be  as President Alfonsin has so often said  a post-mortem solidarity.Rightly  since we are responsible for our own future  and are determined never >gain to need that post-mortem solidarity  we believe that it is not possible to deal with situations which are no longer traditional and conventional with the traditional and conventional models and instruments. This is true of the debt. It is fair to acknowledge that in several developed countries there is a growing understanding of the need for a new  unconventional approach to a new problem. The United States Senate recently passed a Bill in which  analysing the question of the external debt  it proposed the creation of an international authority to develop new methods so that creditors and debtors might find a solution to this problem on which to a great extent the present and future of Latin America now depend. The viability of democracy  its continuity and its strength depend above all on the hope of the people  the conviction that it is democracy that makes possible the struggle for a better future. It must be made clear to the Assembly that in Latin America the persistence of the unjust situation created by the debt and discriminatory trade practices is destroying the hope of the peoples."
"6",323,"AUS",42,1987,"﻿It had been the intention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  Mr. Hayden  to be present at this session of the General Assembly for his general debate statement. It is evidence of the Australian Government's deep attachment to the United Nations and the principles which underlie the Organization that Mr. Hayden has presented each Australian general debate statement since his appointment in 1983. On this occasion  however  events in our own region compelled Mr. Hayden to return home from New York. The statement I shall now make is the statement Mr. Hayden would have delivered if it had been possible for him to attend this session.Let me first extend to Mr. Peter Florin my congratulations on his assumption the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. At the same time I should like to express Australia's warm appreciation to the outgoing President and representative of a fellow Commonwealth country  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh.As Australia prepares to commemorate the 200 years which have passed since the first European settlement in 1788  a feeling of celebration is naturally enough developing in my country But there is also occurring in Australia a new degree o analysis of the developments that have brought Australia to its present condition and the reasons for them. As a result  more Australians are becoming more clear about the real meaning of their past and their future.Australia's relative advantages in the production and export of raw materials served us well in colonial times and have continued to be the mainstay of our exports until the present. The sharp decline in the terms of trade for primary commodities — something we share with many developing countries - has/ however  made it clear to us that we need to diversify our export base without neglecting our traditional strengths.At the same time we are finding that our past policies which created a sheltered and protected environment for manufactured goods and services  have poorly prepared those sectors of our economy for competition in world markets. We are now addressing seriously the task of structural adjustment  which is needed to put our economy on a more mature footing.Our bicentenary particularly reminds Australians of the extent of the disruption suffered by the original inhabitants of our country  the Aboriginal people  now a minority in the land. Australia  in other words  is at an especially important point in its development  seeking to understand the reality of its past and preparing for the realities of its future. Our economic and industrial structures are undergoing fundamental out necessary reform.Australians are going through an equally stressful process towards a proper understanding of the effect of their history on their Aboriginal compatriots. That demands great change - in such matters as land rights  protection of cultural systems and heritage and economic development. It is a difficult  complex process  often frustrating  always demanding unusual understanding and new attitudes of mind. So  in their bicentenary year  Australians are going through a period both of celebration and of deep reflection. I mention this because the process gives Australians a better appreciation of many of the issues that are preoccupying the world community; because we all have a significant stake in seeing these issues dealt with effectively  expeditiously and fairly.With such a perspective  two issues are clearly of immediate importance and pressing concern; one is our failure to agree on systematic  effective and just ways to solve the problem of international debt; the other is the distortion of world markets and the resultant hardship to innocent bystanders caused by the trade policies of the major economies.The two issues are connected  not least in that they both threaten grave consequences for all - industrial nations and developing nations. North and South alike. In this context I commend Ambassador Yeutter's comment to members of the United States Congress last February  ""Would that our grandchildren were to understand what we are doing to them.""Present international economic conditions reflect the difficult economic circumstances in both rich and poor countries. The latest world development report of the World Bank points out some of the dangers in the international economy and mentions the need for the wealthier countries to face more squarely the damage that their domestic policies are causing the developing countries. It is therefore time to ask whether or not the paralysis in economic policy-making is becoming so serious that the world economy is on the verge of sliding into an era of stagnation and protectionism.The Baker plan set out the framework for the resolution of the international debt crisis. It was an attempt to forge an international consensus in which the different parties would all contribute to a solution and they would all gain from co-operation. Unfortunately  the plan in our view is not working  mainly because the richer parties have not been pulling their weight. Not only have the wealthier countries failed to tackle fiscal and trading imbalances  but private international banks have also failed to support the Baker plan. As a result  there is really no effective world plan to solve the continuing international debt crisis.Although the Baker plan has in essence failed  its three original elements remain the key to the solution of the world economic crisis. These elements are  first  that heavily indebted developing countries need to formulate and implement structural adjustment plans at home  in particular by curbing excessive Government spending and promoting exports in an endeavour to service their international debts; secondly  creditor nations in turn would need to support structural adjustments in the developing countries through such institutions as the World Bank  by increasing resources flows to the heavily indebted countries thirdly  private international banks would also be expected to support such a plan.It is important  however  to resist the notion that the first step to a solution is to allocate blame to one side or another. The great task is to find a solution that does not  on the one hand  destabilize the international financial system or  on the other hand  increase the severity of the social and political burdens which the debt crisis imposes on the people of less developed nations.In this  each side to the issue has a great responsibility. Debtor nations should not undermine the financial system by walking away from their obligations. Creditor nations cannot insist on debt repayment pressed to the point that it destroys the human and other resources of debtor nations. Each side must therefore recognize the validity of the other's point of view. A solution should be approached by seeking  not only to maximize the advantage of all concerned  but also to ensure that the broad economic interdependence between nations is recognized. Neither party can be seen in isolation  important interdependences must be considered  including the responsibilities of the debtor countries  the creditor countries  the private banks and the multilateral agencies. It is in the long-term interest of all parties to co-operate in overcoming these grave and continuing economic difficulties.In the long term the solution also demands some form of broad structure that would help to invest resources intelligently and would establish  in advance  ways in which debt could be repaid more effectively  more systematically and more fairly. This requires a more supportive external economic environment  which must include adequate external financing in support of macroeconomic and structural policies in debtor countries  efforts by surplus industrial countries to maintain the maximum rate of growth they can afford  continued reductions in international interest rates  and action by the major industrialized countries to reduce protectionism  including protectionism in agriculture.In addition to these points  another critical ingredient should be a co-ordinated economic adjustment by the major economies: a managed mixture of monetary and fiscal change and reduced trade protection along the lines emphasized at various economic summits. The alternative to such managed adjustment is the chaos which will result when the market enforces its own adjustment to the detriment of both culpable participants and innocent bystanders alike. This is an essential point: the policies driving towards this conclusion are not only endangering the interests of developing countries; they also threaten the interests of the developed countries.The dangers to the world economy are equally serious from trade protectionism  which is such a feature of the current world trading environment. The World Bank has warned of the results of the resurgence of protection in the form of non-tariff barriers to trade in manufactures. This policy will undermine the integrity of the system of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT') even further and will impede the exports of less developed countries  which in turn will aggravate their debt problem.Unfair trade in agricultural products is especially serious. Indeed  it is potentially ruinous. The Tokyo Summit offered not much more than a bare acknowledgement of the problem almost 18 months ago although it was the first time that the major economies admitted that there was a problem and that it needed their joint attention. Their perception of it has changed significantly since then. The change has been noticeable at such developments as the GATT meeting at Punta del Este a year ago  at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Ministerial Council in Paris last May  and at the Venice Summit last June. Indeed  the Venice Summit made an important commitment towards reforming agricultural trade by calling on all involved to refrain from actions which ""by further stimulating production of agricultural commodities in surplus  increasing protection or destabilizing world markets"" (ft/42/344  para. 20) would damage trade relations. This increase in consciousness of the problem over only 18 months has been an important and  in the Australian Government's view a hopeful  development in that it injects urgency into finding ways to solve a problem which is contributing significantly to uncertainty and disorder in the global economic system.Distortions in global agricultural trade caused by barriers to market access and subsidization policies of the major economies have seriously affected Australia  among other efficient and competitive producers. They have raised a huge impediment to the efforts of the Australian Government towards recovery from our economic difficulties of the early 1980s. Australia  therefore  attaches high priority to the Uruguay round of multilateral negotiations on agriculture. Australia's concern led it to joining 13 other non-subsidizing exporters in the Cairns Group of fair traders in agriculture in August last year. That group played an important role at Punta del Este in the successful campaign to include agriculture in the negotiating mandate and for the mandate to encompass negotiation of rules for all measures affecting market access and export competition.These negotiations on agriculture will be a major test of the commitment of GATT members to an open  market-oriented trading system. The GATT rules and disciplines which have overseen world trade for the last 40 years have never been extended to cover agricultural products in a comparable way to their coverage of manufactures. This failure has been a major problem in the current world economic environment.Australia put a proposal to the European Management Forum at Davos in January of this year to help solve problems in world trade in agriculture. Our proposal underlined the need to reassert the role of comparative advantage in shaping world trade in agriculture and to restore the link between market signals and production trends. Our proposal aimed progressively to reduce the gap which exists between world and domestic prices in many countries  and it called for the careful management of stocks to restore order in world markets. Acceptance of such an approach would produce a world order in agricultural trade in which comparative advantage and market signals are once more the major influences. But it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the most important and necessary ingredient in programmes to alleviate the crisis in agricultural trade is immediate action by the major agricultural subsidizers to eliminate all agricultural subsidies.As with international debt  a solution will emerge  one way or another  to the problems caused by unfair trading. What is not so clear is whether it will be a benign solution or a disorderly one; whether it will be a planned solution by well-informed and well-intentioned policymakers; or a chaotic one forced on recalcitrant governments by market forces driven by uncertainty and frustration. If markets enforce their own solutions to the problems of international debt and unfair trading  there will be instability in foreign exchange rates and on commodity exchanges  debtor default  world recession and world tension  or even worse.With such serious prospects threatening us all  some blunt truths need to be expressed to those who have the capacity to find and enforce sensible solutions. Unfair trading is in essence an extremely unfriendly act - even a hostile one. One should not be surprised  therefore  if its victims react accordingly.Secondly  if developed economies' policies  particularly protectionist policies  impoverish their customers  they themselves will suffer the consequences of reduced export prospects and restricted world trade. Finally  when unfair trading reduces the capacity of countries like Australia to promote political and social stability through aid programmes  one should not be surprised if donor countries like Australia  find themselves forced to reduce these aid programmes. This threat of economic and political instability adds weight and urgency to the third great imperative facing the world community; control of armaments  to which I now turn. Australia argued at the recent Conference on disarmament and development that security is a wider concept than a definition in purely military terms would allow. In our view  security has important economic and social  as well as military  dimensions.Disarmament and development may not be tied together in an exclusive relationship; the abolition of arms may not lead automatically to the abolition of our economic problems. But it is a fact that military spending does take up a disproportionate share of global resources: this has been estimated to be 20 times the amount disbursed through official development assistance. Arms imports  to take another example  are responsible for roughly one-quarter of the debt burden of the nations of the South.While Australia believes that effective and lasting disarmament should lead to larger and more predictable flows of assistance to less developed countries  we also believe that the economic benefits of the implementation of a wider concept of security will be of greater importance to all countries.The other obvious  major reason for the urgency in dealing with the arms race  particularly the nuclear-arms race  is the destruction that it threatens. Australia warmly welcomes the prospect that the United States and the Soviet Union will reach an intermediate nuclear forces (INF) agreement  and particularly we welcome their decision to eliminate ground-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asian region as well.If this agreement is reached  three critically important principles will have been accepted. One is that it will be the first agreement which not only reduces but also entirely eliminates a whole class of modern  front-line nuclear arsenals. It will also give concrete expression to the principle that security cannot be achieved by a build-up in weapons alone. And it will bear witness to the idea that security can be enhanced by balanced and verifiable arms reduction and disarmament assures. Regrettably  the chances of an agreement to reduce the levels of strategic nuclear arms have not advanced far since the Reykjavik Summit last year. Discussions in the defence and space components of the negotiations between the super-Powers have also not yet achieved a breakthrough. In the strong belief that the issue is not the preserve only of the nuclear Powers  Australia has been an energetic participant in efforts by the international community to achieve nuclear-arms control and disarmament. We have urged the leaders of both the United States and the Soviet Union not to miss the opportunity apparently before them now o reach accord on all the topics under negotiation. Further progress on the issue f strategic arms would be greatly facilitated by agreements also to eliminate chemical weapons and to control conventional weapons. In a specific field to which Australia has devoted special attention  our resolution with New Zealand last year on the urgent need for a comprehensive test-ban treaty attracted the highest support of any of the draft resolutions submitted to the Assembly on the issue of nuclear testing. We are co-operating again this year with New Zealand and our other traditional co-sponsors to produce draft resolution which reflects a practical  non-declaratory approach to a treat which we hope will receive very wide support.We have also taken steps towards the development of an international system monitoring network so that the necessary verification measures will be ready for test-ban treaty. And we have made special efforts to contribute to the international effort to eliminate chemical weapons  efforts which appear to be close to fruition Australians share with other peoples good reasons for this active interest this issue: that is  the extra dimension of danger which unconstrained armament add to developments which are already unstable.I refer in this context  to the Middle East dispute  the war between Iraq and Iran  the deteriorating situation in southern Africa and the divisions between North and South Koreans. Australia continues to support the principle that the international community has a major role in resolving such disputes.We especially support the Security Council and the Secretary-General in the efforts to end the Iraq-Iran conflict. We support the proposal that the United Nations should contribute to reconciling North and South Korea by admitting both Members of the Organization. Both North and South Korea have  for example  recently acceded to the Antarctic Treaty.We profoundly regret that the Government of South Africa continues to turn back on the sincere demands of the world community for genuine dialogue and peaceful change in that troubled country  that it continues to reject the legitimate aspirations of the majority black population to political rights. The actions of the international community in adopting economic and other measures against South Africa are welcomed by Australia  which understands the growing anger and frustration of African countries in the face of continuing South African intransigence.Australia also continues to be concerned by the plight of the Kampuchean people and disappointed at the lack of movement towards a political settlement during the past eight years. We hope that the increased level of activity in recent months represents real elements of flexibility among the parties and that it might free the way to the start of talks and lead to an end to foreign occupation of Kampuchea and to the self-determination of its people. There are also some encouraging signs of progress in Central America.Australians have a particularly compelling reason for their energetic interest in the arms issue  to which I have just referred. The region in which we live is feeling ever more strongly the pressures exerted by the clash of ideology  distortions in the world economy  the legacy of colonialism and the rivalry between the super-Powers. Our immediate neighbourhood is mercifully relatively free of the immediate military effects of these pressures. With our island neighbours  we are concerned to ensure that the South Pacific remains peaceful. This is why we are committed to the principle that the South Pacific and the Antarctic continent remain nuclear-free under the arrangements established for these zones. We believe that the disarmament provisions of the Antarctic Treaty  which ensure that the territory of Antarctica is used only for peaceful purposes and the obligations that the Treaty carries for the effective management of the Antarctic in support of the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter  continue to be in the best interests of all peoples.That is also the reason for the concern felt by Australia and its island neighbours for a viable  peaceful political solution in New Caledonia. We believe that the people of New Caledonia should have been given a wider range of options in the recent referendum and that this referendum should have been conducted in a manner consistent with the established United Nations principles of decolonization. We trust  nevertheless  that a peaceful transition to a truly multiracial independence will take place in New Caledonia and that the situation there will not be allowed to threaten the stability of the region. This is of course a matter to which the United Nations Special Committee of 24 has been devoting its attention  in which process we are interested.Australia also shares with its South Pacific neighbours concern over the destructive effects of the protectionist commodity policies of major economies. Small primary producers with fragile economies tend to be the first to feel the effects of these policies and the last to recover from them. The South Pacific is a region with many examples of this distressing reality. In such circumstances  the prospects of preserving its peaceful nature depend not only on fair and rational solutions to the problems of unfair trading and colonialism  but also on a realistic resolution of the arms issue. Peace in the South Pacific  after all  is connected closely with developments in the North Pacific  where there is a concentration of military forces second only to that in Europe  Australia has suggested that there would be advantage in the United States and the Soviet Union initiating dialogue on their respective security perceptions and concerns in the North Pacific area. We hope that this will lead in time to the development of greater confidence and security  mutually between the super-Powers  but also among the countries of the region. Australia offers this suggestion  once again making the point that efforts to defuse the nuclear-arms issue should not be confined to those most immediately involved. Arms-control and disarmament questions ate the legitimate concern of the whole international community.For this reason  I wish to conclude this statement by suggesting ways in which this Organization can improve its capacity to act for the international community. I do so as a representative of a country which gives way to no other country in this Hall in its support for the United Nations.The fact is that many countries are showing a lack of confidence in the United Nations. Worse  this lack of confidence is most obvious in those countries which contribute most to the finances of the United Nations. The lesson should not be lost on us. Several factors are working to erode the credibility of this Organization. Secretariats have grown in size. Their salaries and other emoluments sometimes outstrip those enjoyed by ministers and civil servants in the countries which fund them. Committees  commissions and special conferences have proliferated  giving the United Nations the reputation in some quarters of being an ineffective talking shop.Dr. Herbert Evatt  as Australia's Minister for External Affairs  played a notable part in the founding of the United Nations As early as 1947 he asked the General Assembly to consider whether United Nations machinery was translating into life and reality its economic and social pledges. He referred then to the risk of the United Nations becoming ""all harness and no horse"". It is essential that that question be considered anew. The Special Commission established by the Economic and Social Council provides an opportunity for Member States to examine the nature of the horse and to ensure that the harness is as effective and as light as possible. In particular  the Australian Government urges Member States to use the Special Commission to review the 280 or so bodies which have grown over the years  with a view to avoiding duplication  abolishing some bodies and amalgamating the functions of others  while preserving the machinery which works well.Australia wishes to emphasize the point that while the cost of international organizations continues to grow at an alarming rate  many Member States  including Australia itself  face serious budgetary and adjustment problems which limit their capacity to meet such costs. Our taxpayers' enthusiasm for the burden of funding the United Nations will be strained while the impression persists that the Organization is escaping the economic discipline they and their Governments are facing.In areas where the United Nations has shown its effectiveness  Australia has this year raised its contributions to programmes it considers have priority. I mention  for example  assistance to the United Nations Development Programme  Palestinian refugees  population programmes  control of drug abuse  the environment and international health concerns. Our contributions in these areas have been increased. But the resources Australia can provide to the United Nations are not without limit. So long as the costs to us of multilateralism continue to rise so steeply  we will have to make difficult choices; whether or not  for example  we should consider membership of all United Nations agencies.We make that point forcefully because it is centrally important to the continued effectiveness of this Organization's capacity and even to its future  make the point in the interests of the United Nations as well as of Australians. Equally forcefully  Australia emphasizes that this in no way suggests any diminution of our commitment to United Nations ideals which  after 40 years  is as profound as ever. Mr  Evatt told the General Assembly 40 years ago that the Australian Government regarded the support of the United Nations as a cardinal principle in its foreign policy. Firm support for the multilateral system and for an effective United Nations is still a central feature of the Australian Government's foreign policy."
"7",370,"AUT",42,1987,"﻿It is with great pleasure that I congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. It is an expression of esteem for your country. We wish you luck and success in carrying out your important task. I also wish to convey my sincere thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Humayum Rasheed Choudhury  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  for the leadership that he showed on so many occasions during the forty-first session of the General Assembly.Let me  further pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Pérez de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts to promote peace and international co-operation. We thank him for his dedicated work to improve the effectiveness of our Organization.In the Charter of the United Nations our solemn obligation ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"" is enshrined as a matter of utmost importance. Thus  already in its preamble  the United Nations Charter reflects mankind's basic aspiration for personal liberty and economic prosperity  safeguarded by a network of social security.One of the most important tasks with which the international community is confronted is the elaboration of concepts of disarmament that are both ambitious and realistic. Multilateral disarmament negotiations are a necessary complement: to the negotiations between the most powerful States.Assessment of the result of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development might vary from State to State. Austria agrees with the conclusion reached by the Conference that disarmament and development are among the priority concerns of the international community and are pillars on which enduring international peace and security must be built.The recent agreement in principle reached by the Foreign Ministers of the United States and the Soviet Union on the complete elimination of intermediate-range nuclear forces augurs well not only for the relations between East and West but for the entire world community.We welcome this agreement as a first step in the right direction. If it is to lead to more stability  it will have to be followed by substantial reductions in conventional armaments and by the total elimination of chemical weapons. We also regard the early conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty as a vital measure to inhibit the further vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons. A few days ago the fourth negotiating session of the follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) was opened in Vienna. The Conference has thus entered the decisive stage.The Conference must now transform the more than 150 proposals into a concluding document which contributes to the full implementation of the Helsinki commitments and serves as a blueprint for a renewed and genuine European detente policy.We expect substantive progress in removing the barriers which  contrary to the Final Act of Helsinki  still inhibit contacts  communication and the free flow of information between the people of East and West. Only when people in all participating States enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms  only if they can come together and communicate freely  will we have achieved our goal; a genuine and lasting European peace order.In spite of positive tendencies in some important areas of international co-operation  multiple crises and armed conflicts remain unsolved.The war between Iraq and Iran has caused immense suffering. Yet the fighting goes on unabated in defiance of numerous calls to end hostilities. The unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) expresses clearly the demand of the world community for an immediate cease-fire. Austria fully associates itself with that resolution. The efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about a just and honourable end to this war deserve our full support. The Austrian Government considers his role in this regard to be of particular relevance. We join those who have called on both parties to show the greatest flexibility in the search for a negotiated solution of the conflict.The situation in the Middle East continues to pose one of the most serious threats to global peace and security. We note with satisfaction that the idea of convening an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations is gaining increased international support. We consider the following elements essential to a solution of the Middle East conflict:Observance of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which still provide the most widely accepted basis for a solution; withdrawal from occupied territories; respect for the right of all States to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries; and recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people and participation by its representative  the PLO  in the entire negotiating process.We remain deeply concerned about the continuing occupation of Afghanistan and the violation of its sovereignty. The tremendous suffering of the Afghan population  whether inside the country or in refugee camps  must not be forgotten. We have taken note of certain steps of the recent policy of national reconciliation  as well as the invitation of the Special Rapporteur  Mr. Brnacora  on the question of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Afghanistan. These first signs should be followed by more decisive measures leading to a full and free exercise of the right to self-determination of the Afghan people as a whole.The foreign occupation of Kampuchea is also a cause for continuous and serious concern for my country. Recently a number of diplomatic moves have been undertaken with a view to breaking the present deadlock. Austria has followed these developments with keen interest. We will carefully examine all ideas and proposals aimed at promoting a peaceful solution with a view to identifying possible Austrian contributions.I sincerely hope that a negotiated political settlement  which should be based on the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the International Conference on Kampuchea and which has to be acceptable to all sides  can be reached and that the suffering of the Kampuchean people can come  at long last  to an end. Austria calls upon all parties concerned to demonstrate the necessary political will to overcome remaining obstacles in order to engage in a genuine process of negotiation.Central America has been a hotbed of tension for a number of years  we welcome the signing of the Arias Plan by five Central American countries as a useful step towards peace and stability in this region  Austria supports this regional plan for peace and democracy  based on respect for human rights  Internal political dialogue  national reconciliation and non-intervention. Only pluralistic democratic societies closely co-operating in the spirit of good-neighbourliness can successfully address the underlying social and economic problems of the region. There is an historic chance for the nations of Central America. This chance must be seized.Austria remains fully committed to the cause of freedom and dignity for the people of southern Africa  Austria strongly rejects and firmly condemns apartheid  a policy that negates the very foundation of civilization: dignity of roan. We are convinced that only the eradication of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic  United and non-racist society  based on the free exercise of universal suffrage  can lead to a peaceful solution of the deeply rooted problems of South Africa and bring peace to the whole region. This means  of course  also the realization of independence for Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) .Austria started to contribute actively to the aims of the United Nations immediately after being admitted as a Member State in 1955. In his first statement: before this Organization  the then Austrian Foreign Minister  Leopold Pigi stated that: Neutrality would keep us free from military alliances and that intensive co-operation in the framework of the international community of nations  with all means at our disposal  would contribute to maintain international peace.In practice these guiding principles represent the corner-stone of our permanent neutrality and at the same time the expression of our active participation in international co-operation based on the principles of the United Nations Charter.One of the most respected applications of these principles are the peace-keeping operations. Peace-keeping operations have proved to be an effective instrument for the stabilization of dangerous conflicts  a service to which Austria contributes in the interest of the international community as a whole. Since 1964 well over 20 000 Austrian soldiers have served in United Nations peace-keeping operations. At present more than 850 Austrian soldiers are serving on the Golan Heights  in Cyprus and at various locations in the Middle East. I am pleased to be able to inform the General Assembly that the Austrian Government has only recently decided to respond favourably to a request by the Secretary-General to Increase its contingent in the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNPICYP) by another 100 soldiers at the end of October.Troop contributors to UNPICYP are bearing a heavy and disproportionate financial burden. I hope very much that the proposal of the Secretary-General for a partial solution of this problem  namely the financing of UNPICYP through assessed contributions  will be accepted by the members of the Security Council at the earliest possible date. Pending such a decision  we appeal to all Member States to increase their voluntary contributions to this Important peace-keeping operation. Developing and strengthening contacts and co-operation with all its neighbouring countries regardless of their political system is a central element of Austria's foreign policy. Close ties  not only between governments but also between individuals  are the beet guarantee for fruitful and stable relations. Austria therefore continues to diversify co-operation with all neighbouring countries regardless of their political system.Allow me to add a few words on our relations with Italy. The good and friendly  relations with this important neighbouring country were developed even further in recent years. This has been fully confirmed to me at an unofficial meeting by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Giulio Andreotti in June 1987  I should like to stress that in this context the question of South Tyrol is of special importance. In 1960 and 1961 the General Assembly adopted resolutions which  in 1969  led to an agreement between Austria and Italy on a new framework for the autonomy of South Tyrol. Notwithstanding the important progress realized since then  some essential provisions of the autonomy measures have yet to be implemented. This holds true especially for a centrepiece of autonomy  the use of the German language in court as well as before police and administrative authorities. We regret that  in spite of a basic agreement reached in May 1983 between representatives of the Italian Government and the German-speaking minority  and in spite of a political compromise arrived at in September 1986  this very important provision has not yet been enacted.Austria shares the ongoing and justified concern of the population of South Tyrol. We believe that any further delay in the implementation of the Autonomy Statute agreed on in 1969 carries the danger of increasing radical tendencies and ethnic tensions in South Tyrol  as has been reflected in recent election results. We hold that it is high time for a speedy completion of the implementation of the Autonomy Statute in order fully to implement the rights of the ethnic minorities and to guarantee that the ethnic groups in South Tyrol live together peacefully.The world economic situation in recent years has been characterized by a continuing debt burden for many developing countries  increasing protectionist tendencies  a decline in real-commodity prices and slow growth in general  although a number of countries have achieved remarkable performances. On the other hand  several of the poorest countries suffered further losses in their per capita income.The present weak international economic environment hardly promotes innovative and liberal tendencies  but  rather  protectionism and structural immobility. Multilateral economic co-operation is thus endangered by bilateralist forces or unilateral action. Last year a successful special session of the General Assembly devoted to the economic crisis in Africa  the first ever to focus on problems of a whole continent  adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  Determined efforts to speed up that Programme are essential to alleviate the economic plight of many sub—Saharan African countries.Even after the encouraging results of the special session on Africa and the successful launching of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year  there was still widespread doubt and scepticism about the outcome of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). However  the adoption by consensus of the final act of UNCTAD VII within an atmosphere of pragmatism and constructive co-operation heralds a major achievement.Economic progress is not an end in itself. It has to serve the individual. Improving the quality of life and allowing man the pursuit of happiness is not only a matter of growth rates. It is equally important to solve our pressing environmental problems.Serious incidents and shocking research results have induced growing public awareness that the ongoing degradation of our environment affects all nations. International co-operation to counteract this danger is urgently called for.The depletion of the ozone layer poses an increasing threat of global climatic change. Austria has taken a leading role in endeavours to achieve international countermeasures in this regard. The early entry into force of the Vienna convention on the protection of the ozone layer and the further development of international environmental law must be pursued with high priority.Nuclear radiation  like other forms of pollution  does not stop at national borders. Therefore  Austria firmly believes that the legitimate interests of countries that could be affected by the trans boundary effects of the use of nuclei energy have to be taken into account. Accordingly  Austria attributes particular importance to the conclusion of bilateral agreements with all its neighbouring countries in this field. We recognize the achievements in the process of multilateral codification realized within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Austria none the less advocates the elaboration of additional international rules in such areas as State liability and binding international safety standards for nuclear-power plants.Some environmental problems  like long-range trans boundary air pollution  can be successfully addressed on a regional level. For my region  the Economic Commission for Europe (ЕСЕ) has become the most important framework in that respect. Austria  together with countries from different regional groups  has submitted proposals in the context of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) with a view to enlarging and deepening the relevant activities of the ЕСЕ.	'My country highly values the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development  under the chairmanship of Norway's Prime Minister Brundtland. It is indeed impossible to separate environmental aspects from economic and development issues. We agree with the Commission's conclusion that  if we do not succeed in embarking on a policy of sustainable development  we do in fact erode the basis for our common future. The tragic effects of deforestation prove that once nature's balance is distorted the vicious circle can be broken only with difficulty.Development strategies - and  indeed  any economic policy - have to take duly into account all possible environmental implications. The ecological dimensions have to be considered on an equal footing with strictly economic factors  from the formulation to the evaluation of every single project.The Charter of the United Nations contains the obligation of all States to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. Social policy must be among out central concerns during the coming decades. Clear policy guidelines will have to be established and the solution of economic and development problems seen in close relation to social policies and social welfare. Social progress  the advancement of women  questions relating to youth  the elderly or disabled  control of crime and drug abuse are among the most urgent topics in the area of social concern.The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held in June at Vienna constitutes a very promising start to combating drug abuse and solving related social and economic questions in a constructive and coherent manner. A well-co-ordinated follow-up on national and international levels  as well as within the United Nations system  is of utmost importance. The Interregional Consultations on Developmental Social Welfare Policies and identified priorities for strengthening co-operation in social welfareidentified procedures to facilitate international co-operation in the Lamentation of norms in this area. We welcome the growing awareness of global social dimensions in the international community.Recognizing the increasing importance of strengthening and consolidating the role of the United Nations in the social field  the Secretary-General has taken measures to concentrate all major activities on questions of broad social policy social development  including the co-ordination of illicit-drug control  within the United Nations offices in Vienna. We warmly welcome this Liaison in the light of the recommendations of the Group of High-Level governmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Functioning of the United Nations.In his annual report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has identified a ""growing commonality factor in international affairs"". (A/42/1  p.2)My colleague the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany  Genscher  has spoken in this context of ""an age of global domestic policy"". Í2/PV.10  p.47)The recognition of the increased level of interdependence in all fields calls an improved capacity of the Organization to assure an efficient collective response to emerging world issues.A reform process is thus not only necessary to improve the organizational response and global management capacity  but also to restore full confidence in the United Nations. The reform process has started; the Secretary-General has taken the first steps. But reform is an ongoing and continuous process  for which the Member States and the leadership o£ the individual organizations of the United Nations system are equally responsible.We are encouraged by the fact that so far we have been able to proceed on the basis of consensus  a path that should be vigorously pursued in the interests of the Organization.We welcome in this regard the proposal of the Secretary-General to revitalize the Economic and Social Council  to enable it to fulfil its original mandate. The proposal that the ""Council might become  in practice  a Council of Ministers foe Economic and Social Affairs"" with authority to give ""greater strength and coherence to the system as a whole"" (Ā/42/1  p.15) is of great validity. We believe  however  that adequate organizational arrangements and preparations will have to be made to guarantee the maximum effectiveness of such high level meetings.Austria equally welcomes contributions to the reform process from the outside. In this regard  the recent study by a panel of eminent personalities on United Nations reform  sponsored by the Ford Foundation and the United Nations Association of the United States  deserves our full attention. That and similar research work testify to the general growing interest and commitment to a strong United Nations.Two years ago  in the context of International Youth Year  Austria launched an initiative to promote youth employment. We called it ""HOPE '87"". Austria  together with the United Nations  organized a world-wide competition of more than 500 original employment projects run by young people. During this session of the Assembly my country will present an exhibition and a film about this initiative and the intended follow-up. We very much count on the continued support of Members for the ideas and aims of this initiative  which nave already given new hope to many young people from all over the world. Hope should not only be given to youth  but to all those people suffering from violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this regard  over the last 40 years the United Nations has developed an impressive body of legal instruments. However  negative phenomena such as arbitrary executions  torture  the denial of fundamental rights  racism and intolerance still prevail in many parts of the world.Let us intensify our co-operation to ensure that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universally guaranteed and respected. We should support  in particular  all efforts to strengthen the implementation machinery of the numerous international instruments that already exist in the field of human rights. Only on the basis of the conviction that human rights are of truly universal concern will we be able to fulfil our duties in this regard  duties which have the individual human being  his rights and his dignity  at their very heart.The resolution of regional conflicts  the strengthening of international partnership  the reform of international institutions and the preservation of the environment all seem to have one particular element in common: the need for a comprehensive legal framework. The development of this framework could not have been possible without the United Nations. We must all continue to contribute actively to endeavours to find solutions based on international law for the challenges of today and tomorrow.Among these challenges we find a particularly odious phenomenon: international terrorism. There can be no exculpation whatsoever for those who endanger and destroy human lives  irrespective of their motives. The international community took an important step to fight this scourge by adopting a resolution by consensus two years ago. We sincerely hope that that consensus will prevail also during the current session of the General Assembly. A further intensification of international co-operation to combat terrorism - including the elaboration of new legal instruments - remains an absolute necessity. Austria is committed to join in this urgent and important task.International relations must remain firmly based on international law. International law can only represent a foundation for the behaviour of States if it is scrupulously respected. In many cases  it is not an international legal instrument but its implementation which is lacking. One field where this gap between norm and reality seems particularly wide is the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.Before concluding  I should like to share a few thoughts. My delegation was impressed by the statement of the President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  Mr. Choudhuty. Mindful of financial constraints  in his speech before this forum he concentrated on only a few thoughts  while distributing in writing Bangladesh's position on other important world matters. Perhaps that example could be followed by all of us in the future. The distribution of the written texts would ensure that the positions of all Member States on the various subjects would still be made known and would receive due attention. Then  general debates in the plenary Assembly could be structured in such a way as to permit a genuine general debate among political leaders o£ Member States.Austria believes in a strong United Nations; a United Nations that in the self-interest of its Member States will be able to bring about a greater consensus on the solution of existing and the definition of newly emerging problems. It is time to enter the age of global domestic policy. We are called upon to put our thoughts and imagination  our creativity and vision  our sense of pragmatism and realism  to this vital task."
"8",441,"BDI",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  your election to guide the work of this session honours you and gives us cause for rejoicing for  given your qualities as an experienced diplomat and your great experience of the United Nations system  we know that you will lead us to our objective. Moreover  coming from the German Democratic Republic  a country with < rich history  and belonging as you do to a rather special generation  you have a special sensitivity that will enable you to help us in finding the compromises necessary to resolve the many problems that confront us. My delegation  which is particularly pleased at your election  will give you and the other officers of this Assembly all possible assistance.We join other delegations in extending our sincere thanks to your predecessor Mr  Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  for the work he accomplished during his term of office. We pay a tribute also to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our Organization's Secretary-General  for his untiring and increasing work in the service of the international community.Before stating my country's views on some of the items on our agenda  I should like to extend to the Assembly the greetings and best wishes for the success of our work of the President of the Military Committee for National Safety and President of the Republic of Burundi  Major Pierre Buyoya.I shall also venture to explain briefly the reasons that led the armed forces of Burundi  supported by patriotic forces  to take up the difficult but noble and inspiring task of guiding our country's destiny.The regime that was overthrown on 3 September 1987 had been guilty of many violations of our citizens' rights and fundamental freedoms  flouting the cardinal principles enshrined in and guaranteed by our laws and the Constitution  Thus  freedom of expression and thought were no longer tolerated  and this had led to the arbitrary and prolonged detention of innocent persons. Similarly  a watch was being kept on freedom of religion and worship. As a result  disputes between the State and the Catholic Church emerged - sterile wrangling designed only to cover up the mistakes being made in overall policy. National unity  built up so patiently and re-established with such difficulty  was threatened. Finally  the worsening of relations with neighbouring countries and other friendly nations naturally had an impact on co-operation.It was for all those reasons - and many others that it would take me too long to set out here - that President Buyoya  with the support of other dynamic forces in the nation  took over the country's leadership without bloodshed  in an atmosphere of calm and dignity characteristic of the people of Burundi.In his speech on his programme made on 3 October this year. President Buyoya reaffirmed that the new regime would guarantee fundamental rights and freedoms and the safety of foreigners living in our country  so that our country might regain the characteristics for which it was noted: a welcoming and hospitable land where it is a joy to live.That is why I would highlight  among the measures already taken to recover our national health  the release of all political prisoners  amnesty for some prisoners under common law  the opening of churches that had been closed and resumption of the right to worship.The President also declared;""Burundi will continue to work with other African countries within the Organization of African Unity to find solutions to the serious political and economic problems that face our continent. The resolve of our political will  with respect for our commitments to neighbouring countries and other countries of the subregion  is the basis of ail our hopes for a future improvement in our relations. Burundi's presence at and participation in deliberations within United Nations bodies will be assured ...""  Burundi's position on the major international problems of the day  and more specifically on the items now before the Assembly  is based on our analysis of them in keeping with the principles of our foreign policy: good-neighbourliness  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  positive non-alignment  international co-operation and solidarity and support for genuine national liberation movements.Burundi's position will also be based on those well-known objective criteria with regard to disarmament  the relationship between disarmament and development  the economic and debt crisis  political problems such as the illegal occupation of Namibia  apartheid in South Africa  the situation in Central America  the wars in Asia and the tragic problem of the division of the Korean people.In my delegation's view  one of the challenges facing the United Nations  to whose solution it must give priority if it wishes to retain its credibility  is that of southern Africa  where a Territory for which our Organization has direct responsibility is illegally occupied; where independent countries Members of out Organization are constantly being attacked  without being given any breathing space; where armed bands are supplied and financed at great cost to destroy the infrastructure and sow death and devastation among the peoples; and where an inhuman regime denies millions of men and women the right to participate in running their country.In addition to our duty of solidarity to the front-line countries  Burundi has genuine reasons for being interested in what happens in that region. After all  we are not fat from the theatre of those deadly operations  and their impact is felt on our economy in one way or another. Therefore  we are interested in a solution to the region's problems being found as soon as possible. We regard the tragic and anachronistic situation of the Namibian people as a thorn in the flesh of the people of Africa  an insult to the United Nations Council for Namibia  a challenge to the Security Council and a cause of shame to the United Nations. What has not been done  or attempted  in order to drive South Africa out of Namibia? And what has been the result?Despite resolution 2145 (XXI) of 27 October 1966  ending South Africa's Mandate; despite the advisory opinion given by the International Court of Justice on 21 June 1971  declaring that South Africa had an obligation to withdraw its administration from Namibia and end its occupation; despite Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  setting forth the plan for Namibia's independence; despite innumerable resolutions  conferences and seminars - the international community still finds itself powerless in the face of South Africa's continuing refusal to withdraw from Namibia  where it continues to plunder and exploit the wealth of the Namibians on the land and underground.Faced with this situation  the delegation of Burundi believes the international community must mobilize to take up the challenge and give the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole  authentic representative of the Namibian people  all the assistance it needs in its day-to-day struggle against the South African occupier. The actions that must be taken urgently include the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter  because South Africa's illegal presence is a permanent threat to the neighbouring countries in the region and to international peace and security.As for South Africa itself  this Organization has on many occasions condemned and criticized the system of Government that the authorities of that country have imposed by force on their citizens. The apartheid regime of Pretoria  which is the very negation of the universally recognized principle of the equality of all human beings  has no right to rule  and it must disappear·That is why my delegation supports and encourages the nationalist movement  the African National Congress (ANC)  in the struggle against the inhuman racist apartheid regime  and calls for the unconditional release of the nationalist leader Nelson Mandela and his comrades·The acts of aggression and destabilization constantly carried out by the racist Pretoria regime against neighbouring independent States - Angola  Mozambique  Zambia and Zimbabwe in particular - call for total condemnation by our Organization. Not only must we condemn the Pretoria regime for its underhanded actions against the front-line States; we are also duty bound to call for compensation for the losses incurred and to demand that adequate measures be taken to prevent any further acts of destruction.In the northern part of the African continent there is a situation which/ despite the efforts made by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations  has not yet been satisfactorily resolved. Members will have guessed that I have in mind the case of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic. A number of States represented here have recognized it  while others consider that its territory should be an integral part of another State  itself a Member of the Organization. That is a situation which  to say the least  is paradoxical  and legal niceties have not been able to give the advantage to one side or the other on this question  which is a question of puce decolonization. We urge the parties directly involved in the situation to demonstrate great political flexibility and by carrying out the referendum advocated in resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations.As for the conflict between Chad and Libya  we call on these two brother countries  these two neighbours  to demonstrate African wisdom by avoiding a situation that would once again paralyse the pan-African organization  which has not yet recovered from the Western Sahara conflict. Burundi hopes that a peaceful solution to this problem will be found through negotiations within the context of the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU  or else through arbitration by the International Court of Justice at The Hague.In the Middle East  where the problems are as old as this Organization  the situation is far from being a pretty one. When the Israelis deny a homeland to the Palestinians  when the Palestinians swear to destroy the Jewish State  when the friends of both do not urge them to practise moderation and to seek viable political compromises  when Lebanon remains occupied and divided  we have to realize that the chasm is indeed wide and that peace is hardly imminent.We for our part would advocate that the Palestinians' right to a homeland be recognized and that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)   the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  should participate on a footing of equality with the representatives of other States in the region in the search for a lasting solution to the Middle East problem.That region  of strategic importance to the entire world  is  alas  despite the tireless efforts made by many statesmen - most recently by the Secretary-General  Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar - still the scene of one of the most devastating and deadly wars of our age. The conflict between Iran and Iraq may  if we are not careful  provide additional proof of the impotence of this Organization  and particularly of the ineffectiveness of decisions taken by its principal organ  the Security Council. If resolution 598 (1987)   adopted unanimously by the Security Council in July last  suffers the same fate as its resolution 435 (1978)   which established the plan for Namibia's independence  it will be difficult to restore our Organization's credibility. We call on those who have special responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security to pay heed. As for the situation in Afghanistan  my delegation believes that the sons and daughters of that country  if left to themselves  without any pressure from foreign forces  can find a solution that is in their own interests. The same approach is valid for the situation in Kampuchea  in the South-East Asian region. The Kampuchean people can achieve national reconciliation  and the eight-point proposal submitted by the Coalition Government can serve as a basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict.Also in the Par East region  my country is concerned at the unjust fate imposed on the Korean people by the division of their territory into two parts. North and South  and by the presence of foreign troops. It is our view that without outside interference the two parties can achieve peaceful reunification. In that spirit  we welcome the contacts that have occurred between North and South and we trust that they will be continued and even extended to all levels  in order to achieve the full and peaceful reunification of the Korean nation.Turning to the situation in Latin America  my country supports the diplomatic efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group to find a peaceful  mutually acceptable solution to the crisis in Central America. That is why we welcomed the signing  on 7 August 1987  of the Guatemala agreement between the five countries of Central America  which are resolved to create a better future for the Central American region. We call upon all those who have interests in that part of the world to make a positive contribution to ensuring the success of the implementation of the treaty signed in Guatemala City  so that peace and stability can be restored to that region.Although my statement has dealt primarily with political issues  it is my delegation's view that they are far from being the only  or indeed the most important  hindrances to international peace and security. Indeed  in Burundi we believe that the survival of our planet Earth depends also on solutions being found to such thorny problems as poverty  hunger  overpopulation  the worsening economies in the majority of our States  over-armament  indebtedness and so on.According to figures published in the Final Document of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which took place only recently in New York - from 24 August to 11 September - it is estimated that in the developing countries about 1 billion people live below the poverty line  780 million suffer from malnutrition  850 million are illiterate  1.5 billion have no access to medical care  1 5 billion are unemployed  and 1 billion do not have adequate housing. Those statistics speak for themselves and  alas  the projections for the future are not encouraging. On the contrary  it is forecast that most of our countries are simply not economically viable. That is a euphemism for saying that these States should simply disappear.Without a doubt  those are matters of concern. The analyses that led to these alarmist conclusions are based on the deterioration of the economies of those States. But this deterioration is not necessarily to be attributed to the leaders of  or the policies followed by  the States whose disappearance is being predicted. In fact  the prices of the commodities and services that these countries provide by producing  exporting and selling their commodities and agricultural goods are set in bureaucratic offices that are unaware of the concerns of those States. A reorganization of all aspects of the international market is the only way to correct the economic disparities in the world today. The debt problem of many of our countries is simply a logical result of the policy of price fixing and the fluctuations in the abilities of our countries to pay. An equitable solution can be found only in the context of global negotiations on the implementation of decisions on the international economic order.When the President of the United States of America  Mr. Ronald Reagan  addressed the Assembly on 21 September  he confirmed that the United states of America and the Soviet Union had  four days earlier  agreed to conclude an agreement before the end of the year on the elimination of medium- and short-range missiles. This was confirmed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze  when he spoke on 23 September in the Assembly.While we welcomed this communication of historic significance  my delegation would have been even more delighted if we could have been assured that this agreement would enable us to tackle the economic and financial problems facing the world.The resources made available in this way should be directed towards the sectors of economic and social development to enable us  particularly the least developed countries  to catch up in this area.Those who are well versed in disarmament matters tell us that the arms that are to be eliminated relate primarily to Europe. They apparently account for 20 per cent of global military expenditure and so far have never been used. The destruction that has occurred to date has resulted from the use of conventional weapons  which account for the remaining 80 per cent of global expenditure.We cherish the hope that this move to reduce and eliminate the instruments of death will continue and be extended to all categories of weapons. In this connection  my country welcomes the convening here of the first International Conference on the Relationship Between Trade and Development which highlighted the close interrelationship of disarmament and development. We express the hope that the Final Document adopted by the Conference  which is a first step in the right direction  will generate positive effects  so that the world can move towards total and complete disarmament and devote more attention to development  justice  peace and international security."
"9",488,"BEL",42,1987,"﻿Last week the General Assembly unanimously elected Minister Florin to the presidency of its forty-second session. I congratulate him warmly  especially since his diplomatic experience is the best guarantee of the harmonious unfolding of our work. The relations between his country and my own  which have been excellent for a long time  are undergoing a remarkable development. My delegation will be happy to contribute  within its means  to the full success of his difficult task.I should also like to thank his predecessor  Minister Choudhury  who guided the work of the forty-first session with exemplary efficiency.I wish also to pay a particular tribute to the Secretary-General  to his professional qualities  his diplomatic talents and relentless dedication. His efforts to resolve international problems  in particular the conflict in the Gulf  deserve our support and gratitude. In his report to the General Assembly  the Secretary-General affirms his conviction and hope that there will be improved multilateral co-operation  facilitated by a new vision and the necessary pragmatism on the part of Member States. I fully share these conclusions.As in previous years  I wish to make a plea for true universality of the United Nations system. I cannot  therefore  fail to mention the question of the Korean peninsula. I should Like to reiterate that Belgium is in favour of the admission of both Koreas to the United Nations  and in this context  my country expresses the hope for a positive conclusion of direct dialogue between both parties.In his capacity as current President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community  my Danish colleague  Mr. Ellemann-Jensen  has eloquently presented from this rostrum the way in which the 12 member States of the European Community approach the international questions on our agenda. I wish to thank him warmly) and I hasten to stress that Belgium closely associates itself with the statement he made.I should like to focus my remarks on a theme which is particularly dear to me namely  the human dimension of international relations. Two years ago we solemnly celebrated the fortieth anniversary of our Organization. It gave us an opportunity to reflect on the purposes of the United Nations  as inscribed in the Charter  and to evaluate their implementation in all fields. Possibly the picture we drew then of the world situation was not an encouraging one  but all Member States did  nevertheless  renew on that occasion the pledge they had made when adhering to the Charter.It was indeed a pledge  a profession of faith. The peoples of the United Nations have declared in the Preamble of the Charter their determination:""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small"".The Preamble  which contains the entire philosophy of the United Nations  speaks of social progress  tolerance  common interest  justice and peace; the constituent elements of a universal faith. We made this pledge with conviction  some in 1945 and others as they gradually attained independence. Belgium  for its part  enthusiastically joined the founding Members of the ""United Nations for a better world"" as early as at the San Francisco Conference.In past centuries my country had the sad privilege of being the battlefield of European Powers. Successive foreign occupations have fashioned the personality and way of life of the Belgians: we are deeply attached to freedom and democracy; we love our common sense  our spirit of tolerance and conciliation are such that our adherence to the Preamble of the Charter is today as in 1945  marked by fervour and great sincerity. Nobody has expressed those feelings better than my illustrious predecessor Paul-Henri Spaak  who presided over the first session of the General Assembly.	-But reality falls considerably short of pledges. The United Nations may indeed have prevented the outbreak of a third world war. None the less  numerous wars or conflicts continue to plunge families into mourning; millions of individuals suffer from malnutrition and lack of basic health care; fundamental freedoms are flouted in many States Members of our Organization  economic imbalances are not being reduced) and the totalitarianism of some and the fanaticism of others have swollen· the flows of refugees  who are unprovided for and often unwelcome.Hence public opinion is asking some questions and wants to know how the United Nations is endeavouring to implement the credo of San Francisco. Young people  who are the driving force of the better world we all await  are anxious and restless. They realize with bitterness that international relations are not founded primarily on respect for the individual but are essentially inspired by exacerbated ideological considerations  fanaticism and State selfishness  which have little concern for individual and family welfare. In these conditions it comes as no surprise that a sometime sizeable segment of public opinion turns its back on the United Nations.Two years ago we embarked together upon collective self-examination  but I cannot shake off the impression that debates in the United Nations  in New York and in Geneva  sometimes take on an unreal form and often disregard the human dimension without which all multilateral co-operation is condemned to remain sterile.My experience of international relations goes back far enough to keep my optimism intact. This optimism is warranted  I sincerely believe  by a certain number of recent developments on a few essential issues East-West relations  regional conflicts  world economic problems  and human rights. Allow me to dwell upon some of them.The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  which I was honoured to sign on behalf of my country in 1975  is  in so far as it concerns East-West relations  a balanced achievement that tries to overcome the divisions built on the ruins of the last war in Europe. As the emanation of the will of 35 States to foster and develop in mutual respect and tolerance a Europe free from violent conflicts  the Final Act of Helsinki also embodies the hopes for peace of mankind as a whole  since it is true  without a doubt  that a European war would inevitably lead to world tragedy. The Final Act demonstrates our common will to proceed in a particular direction - towards harmonious relations between States  it shows also that for my country and its partners it is essential that in the field of human rights  as in humanitarian matters  the idea must prevail that States exist to serve their citizens  not the other way round.For us  the human dimension is the essence of relations in Europe. True to its long-standing tradition of struggle in the name of human liberty  from the beginning of CSCE Belgium did everything to ensure that in what became the Helsinki Final Act there were appropriate commitments ensuring the improvement of the conditions of life of the individual.The debates at meetings in Belgrade  Madrid and Vienna have demonstrated that the implementation of the provisions of the Final Act in the field of human rights and human contacts has not as yet fully lived up to the hopes of the signatories. Certainly there has been some progress  but it is insufficient  as is clear from the number of violations that have been denounced.The basic principle that laws must be made for man is too often forgotten and supplanted by the concept of man as servant of regulations. That is what guided Belgium's action in the drafting of the Final Act and  later  in the implementation of that instrument and its corollary documents.The Vienna meeting  which opened on 4 November 1986  gave Belgium the opportunity to make its views known and to take appropriate initiatives. In this spirit  Belgium  in agreement with its partners and allies  prepared a proposal the concept and eventual implementation of which should lead to considerable improvement in respect for human rights among all 35 States members of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. That proposal is based on the actual text of the Final Act. It envisages a system of information and representations to Governments in which the individual  as such  has a role to play. Furthermore  it proposes the convening of bilateral meetings to consider litigious cases and a notification procedure for cases or particularly difficult situations  it also offers the possibility for all States to ask for and obtain special meetings of the Thirty-five to discuss and resolve situations or specific cases. This system is completed by the convening of meetings and conferences on the human dimension of CSCE  which will evaluate the implementation of the system  assess the circumstances and possibly recommend new measures. This text constitutes a logical and coherent set of proposals  the driving force for progressive action.In the chapter on the ""Third Basket""  the Final Act  in addition to the general provisions on ""principles""  also went into specific themes of fundamental and immediate interest for the free and entice fulfilment of the human being: human contacts  information  culture and education.At the meeting in Vienna  Belgium was also very active in those fields. It submitted proposals pertaining  inter alia  to the right of the citizen to be aware of his rights  a ban on arbitrary arrests  and the rights of national minorities. In the same spirit Belgium has shown its desire to foster progress in matters of freedom of religion  thought  conscience and conviction  freedom of information and working conditions for journalists. Proposals such as those should  in our opinion  be supported unanimously by all signatory States.Belgium has also contributed to proposals aimed at improving economic co-operation among participating States while at the same time stressing the part that the individual can and must play in such relations  which also contribute to his personal fulfilment.Finally  in conformity with its traditions  Belgium has also used the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to foster new progress in the fields of confidence-building measures and conventional armaments balance. I shall elaborate later on this subject  in which the human element is predominant. In dealing with these important issues of security  disarmament and arms limitation I shall restrict myself to a few points of priority interest to my country since the essence of our views has already been stated by ray Danish colleague  Mr. Ellemann-Jensen  on behalf of the Twelve.The first point that must be made is that the international context and climate are more relaxed than before. We have witnessed over the past few months a series of developments that are unquestionably positive in terms of both East-West relations and disarmament and arms limitation. The odds in favour of meaningful agreements are better than at any other time in recent history. This is the case in particular with regard to intermediate-range nuclear missiles  as shown by the developments of last week  it is true also in respect of the questions of a total  comprehensive ban on chemical weapons.The agreement in principle on the global elimination of intermediate-range nuclear missiles reached in Washington by the United States and the USSR has historic import  as was rightly pointed out by one of the protagonists. It will  indeed  be the first time that negotiations will have led not merely to the beginning of a reduction of nuclear weapons but also to the effectively supervised elimination of an entire category of such weapons.Belgium and its allies have done everything possible in the efforts to arrive at this agreement. Since it is directly affected by the question of intermediate-range missiles  my country has a particular interest in it.An agreement of this kind is clearly to be sought on its own merits  given its importance in both the European and the global context. Without seeking to establish a direct link  the agreement on intermediate-range missiles augurs well for speedy and positive result in strategic arms reduction talks. Like its partners  Belgium favours a 50 per cent reduction in the strategic capacity of both super-Powers  so long as this is carried out in conditions that maintain balance and stability.In this context  the problem of the use of space for military purposes clearly remains. We do not think that the possibility of including a defensive element in the strategic balance should be ruled out a priori. The essential point is to retain what we have already achieved: the anti-ballistic missile Treaty. Clearly this requires a common interpretation and a readiness to envisage to the future  if need be  on the basis of a mutually agreed transitional regime. Here too  we should guarantee stability at the lowest possible level of forces.In agreement on intermediate-range nuclear missiles would have a considerable impact on the overall handling of arms limitation and disarmament questions  especially if it could be followed by a strategic arms reduction treaty. A substantial reduction in the nuclear arsenals of the super-powers leads inevitably to questions about the balance of conventional forces.It is certainly possible to dream of a nuclear-free world  but we should begin in a more realistic way by creating simply a less nuclear world  on the understanding that  for Europe at any rate  any progress in this field must be through a balanced reduction in the level of conventional forces.For this reason  my country looks forward to the beginning next year of new negotiations on conventional stability at a reduced level of forces in Europe as a whole.Reverting to nuclear Issues  the question of a test ban must not be seen as a goal in its own right but rather in the overall context of nuclear disarmament. Belgium believes that realism and a gradual approach are required.At the last session of the General Assembly  I suggested that  while conducting negotiations on a total halt to nuclear testing  the nuclear Powers  in the first place the two super-Powers  should agree to systematic prior notification of all tests and to an exchange of technical data which would make possible progress towards a solution of the remaining problems with regard to verification. It would be useful to couple such exchanges of information with the gradual implementation of a system of verification which  having been tested during nuclear tests could ultimately ensure reliable verification of a general and complete test ban.The most recent round of talks between the United States and the Soviet Union  in Washington  confirms that their differences of opinion have narrowed. Negotiations are soon to begin. The advantages of a gradual approach now seem to be recognized  and we welcome this.Another priority for Belgium Is the speedy conclusion of a convention on the total prohibition of chemical weapons. The urgent need for such an agreement was unhappily underlined once again this year by the use of these horrifying weapons in the Iraq-Iran war. For the first time in that conflict  civilian populations were the victims. Belgium notes with satisfaction the progress made on this subject in the Conference on Disarmament  thanks to the positive attitude of all the countries concerned. The acceptance by the Soviet Union  after that of several other countries  of the principle of challenge inspections made it possible to eliminate a major obstacle. We may thus hope that the Conference on Disarmament will soon succeed In formulating a coherent set of measures to prevent violations by making them detectable.In our opinion the international verification organization will be the cornerstone of a system of verification of chemical disarmament. It should be enabled to begin its work as soon as possible after the entry into force of the convention. I announced during my statement at the Conference  and I am pleased to repeat here  that my country would consider favourably acting as host to that international organization should the Conference request it to do so. In that way my country  the first on whose soil these terrible weapons were used  more than 70 years ago  would place itself at the service of the international community and all mankind in order to contribute to the total elimination of these inhuman weapons.Our delegation  together with its partners  will redouble its efforts to attain its goal of eliminating chemical weapons as quickly as possible  and appeals to all the other participants to help to resolve the problems  the technical aspects and complexity of which I do not underestimate.Although questions of disarmament and arms limitation are global in nature  I have tried to show that our approach  both world-wide and in Europe  is one and indivisible.The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development concluded its work with the adoption of a final document. Belgium welcomes that positive outcome of a Conference that was called upon to analyse for the first time the complexity of the link that might be established between those two concepts that dominate international relations.For Belgium  both two concepts have their own purposes and logic  and should not be considered as mutually dependent. The link that might be established does not have an exclusively financial dimension. Realism compels us to take into account also the right to security  which is essential for the fulfilment of the aspirations of mankind. Security needs should  however  be evaluated as objectively as possible. Without a doubt  underdevelopment is not only a severe threat to the security of States hut also an impediment to the thriving of individuals and societies.Hence solutions to such a serious problem must be found world-wide. In this search for solutions  it is not advisable. In my view  that we should try to draw a distinction in the world between the guilty and the innocent parties. Belgium insists on allowing an open-minded  scientific and realistic spirit to prevail. Numerous regions in the world are badly shaken by bitter conflicts some of which have lasted for 40 years.In the Middle East  suffering and violence are daily realities. The parties concerned  opposed to one another for far too long  are unable to apply in their relations the principles and purposes of the Charter. Civilian populations are the first victims of this situation.However  the idea of an international conference on the Middle East has made progress. My Danish colleague has voiced here the views and aspirations of the 12 Member States of the European Community in this regard. At the beginning of this year I had the privilege to make  on behalf of the Twelve  a trip to the countries most directly involved in the painful Middle East problem. On behalf of my colleagues  I tried to bring positions closer to one another  while recalling the necessary human dimension of a peaceful  just  global and durable settlement. I thought I could detect goodwill on the side of my interlocutors. This made me very happy and restored my hopes.The large number of. victims of the Gulf war cannot leave us indifferent  whatever the political  strategic and economic interests at stake. Let us  however  leave it to the Security Council to try to humanize this conflict  and then to resolve it. Its cruelty and inanity have shocked and outraged the international community. While maintaining strict neutrality in the conflict between Iraq and Iran  Belgium has decided to participate in a purely defensive operation of minesweeping in order to ensure respect for the principle of freedom of navigation in international waters.In southern Africa  positions are polarized to the detriment of the populations involved. It is urgent to establish a genuine dialogue in South Africa and to allow the Namibian people to exercise its right to self-determination.In Central America  rays of hope are appearing. With all my heart I call for an agreement between the countries in the region  based on co-operation  tolerance  non-interference  democracy and the humanization of relations between States and between individuals. I shall not restate the European Community's wish to make a contribution to this effect; my Danish colleague dwelled on it yesterday in his statement on behalf of the Twelve.Finally  in Asia  the Afghan and Cambodian peoples are still unable to determine freely and sovereignty their destiny  and this in spite of repeated appeals by the overwhelming majority of Members of our Organization. The Afghan refugees  whose fate I have witnessed during a recent visit  Reserve  in our opinion  more attention from the international community.When we consider these various conflicts and their consequences  it is not surprising that numerous men and women in the world should ask; What meaning do we give to the obligations Governments have accepted under the Charter? What does the goodwill we proclaim in all circumstances stand for? why are we sometimes brought to trample underfoot the principles of international law though we have reaffirmed them in many resolutions and statements of our Assembly? Mankind needs peace  security  justice and economic and social progress to survive. We need finally to have our deeds match our words. In the economic field  the interdependence of nations has become the leading issue of our debates  and I welcome this. I note  however  that the North-South dialogue is not making progress  that more and more countries have a tendency to withdraw within themselves  or even to wage bitter economic wars. Markets are closing  monetary relations remain unstable  export earnings of developing countries are decreasing  foreign indebtedness rises. The standard of living of populations remains a constant preoccupation. How can we in these conditions preserve human dignity?World economic recovery is still too slow and uncertain. But it is the urgent duty of us all to co-operate  in solidarity  in creating the necessary conditions for a resumption of genuine growth of the world economy  which would benefit in a fair and balanced way both the industrialized and the developing countries. Like other speakers before me  I welcome the consensus which was reached last July in adopting the Final Act of UNCTAD VII. This consensus  remarkable in itself  augurs well for the outcome of the multilateral trade negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).These expressions of international solidarity are all too rare; that is why I should like to express my real satisfaction on this occasion. Indeed  it is common knowledge that there is very often a direct link between economic stability and peace. Together they form the basis for the advancement of the human person  something to which we have committed ourselves when adhering to the Charter.I have tried to put the emphasis on the human dimension in international relations. No one will be surprised therefore if I now also touch upon the problems of terrorism  drugs and AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In spite of their fundamental differences  each of these problems is directly related to the preservation of the physical integrity and the life of human beings. I mention there as instances where international co-operation aimed at the individual must be strengthened urgently  in conformity with the respective fields of competences of the institutions of the United Nations system and leaving aside any narrow political considerations.The human rights situation around the world is far from satisfactory. Much remains to be done. Belgium acknowledges the unity and interrelation of all human rights - political and civil on the one hand; economic  social and cultural  on the other.My country has stressed the importance of the latter category of rights when it voted in favour of the Declaration on the Right to Development (resolution 41/128)  adopted by the Assembly last year. We cannot  however  accept pre-conditions for the exercise of civil and political rights.Belgium considers that respect for these universally recognized and accepted rights is given to varying interpretations depending on geo-political systems  ideologies and cultural environments. For this reason  I stressed five years ago  from this rostrum  the importance my country attaches to the promotion and protection of human rights at the regional level.In 1986 Belgium again became a member on the Commission on Human Rights  where it is contributing to the fullest extent possible and with the utmost impartiality  to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Commission on Human Rights should be given the means fully to carry out its mandate  its action should not be hindered by extraneous considerations.My Danish colleague presented the views of the Member states of the European Community on reform of the procedures and structures of our Organization  following General Assembly resolution 41/213.In my view  the ultimate goal is to restore a climate of confidence between the Organization and all its Members  so as to enable the United Nations to assume its mission with renewed efficiency  in keeping with the Charter's preamble. Let us not forget  however  that such confidence presupposes the full support of our countries' public opinions  media  non-governmental organizations  and all men and women  above all  youth. Indeed  for the realization of their profound aspirations young people rely more and more upon fair and dependable international co-operationMan's happiness is indeed linked to the humanization of international relations. My statement today has no other purpose than to recall this truth  which is too often overlooked."
"10",533,"BEN",42,1987,"﻿It gives me great pleasure and true joy that you. Sir  have assumed the presidency of our annual Assembly session. By your unanimous election you have been asked to perform functions in which your ability and undeniable qualities as a statesman and diplomat will  I am convinced  be a great asset in the proper and successful conduct of our deliberations. We congratulate you and are happy to see you  the representative of a country with which Benin shares the same aspirations to progress  peace and social justice  assume the presidency of this session of the General Assembly of our unique and irreplaceable Organization.You have taken over from your predecessor  our eminent colleague from Bangladesh  Mr. Rasheed Choudnury  to whom I express the appreciation of my delegation and country for the authority  skill and competence of which he gave such brilliant proof in guiding the forty-first session of the General Assembly.The Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  through his devotion and very lofty vision of international public service  also merits my delegation's encouragement and admiration. The challenges that await Him are still immense  the crises of the international society are still many and dangerous to world peace and stability  for the establishment of which Benin reaffirms our full solidarity and support.I am not performing a ritual or carrying out an official duty  speaking after so many brilliant and talented representatives  when I say that the picture of the world  the state of the international society  the unrest on our beautiful planet  inspire and compel us to speak and voice our proposals clearly and with conviction.In subscribing to the principles of our Organization's Charter  all nations  great and small  rich and poor  agree that in complete equality and full sovereignty we should work together  despite our differences and our cultural and ideological sensitivities  in this challenging endeavour to establish peace throughout the world and harmony among nations. This endeavour  despite its noble nature and the statements that magnify it  is still starkly incomplete and very precarious. It is for us to emphasize the deficiencies and point out the limits and our daily failures  so that we may all in this forum go beyond the beauty and rhetoric of our statements from this rostrum and find practical ways to establish understanding  peace and development.Today  thanks to man's genius  the talent of our thinkers and the astonishing progress of science and technology  some great Powers have succeeded in accumulating terrible instruments of our own collective destruction. By dominating the atom and the laser and through the power of computers  two super-Powers  and others increasing in number and ambition  are zealously vying with each other to acquire and upgrade laboratories to gain what they believe to be the attributes of military superiority or perfect deterrence. Let us look for a moment at the stunning figures and facts of that armament  or rather over-armament. We see vaulting ambition and at the same time enormous financial resources being mobilized for war and  consequently  the ruin of civilizations and the certain death of hundreds of millions of men and women on this earth  if mad powers were one day to press the buttons and controls of a nuclear war.These are the first terrifying sentences of a very penetrating work entitled Nuclear Battlefields; ""Every minute of every day  at thousands of locations around the world - f com the plains of North Dakota and Montana  from the Ukraine and Siberia  from southern France and central China  to beneath the Arctic Icepack  to the Sea of Okhotsk  to the Yellow Sea - nuclear missiles sit ready to be launched. In Western Europe nuclear aircraft sit cocked on alert. On and under the high seas  nuclear-armed ships and submarines patrol  waiting for their day to go into battle. The weapons could reach their targets thousands of miles away quicker than it takes roost people to get to work in the morning."" Thus  in all the United States  the Soviet Union  the United Kingdom  France and China - to list but a few - possess between them approximately 4 9 000 and 59 000 nuclear warheads.No reason of State  no ideological or imperial ambition  could justify this rush towards the abyss and the annihilation of what many generations of creators and builders have constructed to ensure the progress and happiness of mankind.Most fortunately certain encouraging signs have appeared. Painstaking and complex negotiations seemed to have led to some agreements. However limited and modest  those results should be encouraged and welcomed. When the Soviet Union and the United States recently reached agreement on intermediate.—range nuclear missiles  my country - and  I am sure  many other nations too - applauded with a sense of relief this beginning of the end of our common anguish. These efforts must be continued and amplified on the basis of mutual  courageous concessions  so that those that have a virtual monopoly of nuclear terror on our seas  on out continents and in space may finally give us grounds for hope. They have that duty and that responsibility to history and the world. A special Conference of our Organization  held from 24 August to 11 September 1987  established that there was a logical link and an almost mathematical relationship between disarmament and development. Thus  it takes only a few statistics to prove that if a small fraction of the expenditure on military and research development - the millions of dollars  intellectual energy  technological creativity devoted to the production of arms - were used to finance the development of the poorest and most deprived  many of the hapless and least developed of our earth would receive additional  invaluable  precious resources with which to feed  care for and educate their citizens.Thus  in 1985 one of the super-Powers had a military budget of $305 billion. Compared to that the total national budget of several countries of the third world taken together  with their paltry figures  is Lilliputian.It is towards that re-channelling of military expenditure to peaceful purposes that our Organization  surmounting the poor excuses of national selfishness  should immediately urge certain Powers to commit themselves seriously to the greater good of future generations.In this finite  truly interdependent  world  despite our diversities  differences and divergence  and despite hegemonistic rivalries  peace cannot and must not remain elusive. Development depends on it; health and the balance of our economies would gain additional resources and renewed vigour from it.Thus we see in the third world the weakness of their economies  the scarcity of resources and the worsening destitution  which carry the threat of social explosions. Today the debt  with its unbearable burden and destabilizing effects  haunts the days and the work of our Governments. As our great comrade-in-arms President Mathieu Kerekou asked at the recent Francophone Summit in Quebec  can we at the same time suffer the crushing debt-servicing and see our export earnings whittled away so scandalously  thanks to the cynical games of the stock-markets and the wealthy Powers? President Kerekou went on to say:	""Indeed  how can we understand and interpret objectively the figures of the underdeveloped countries debt  which in 1970 was $76 billion and in 1986 greatly exceeded $1 000 billion?""How can we understand and interpret objectively the net transfer of capital from third-world countries to the developed countries of more than $30 billion at the end of 1986 compared to $11 billion in 1984?""How can we understand and blithely accept that the export earnings of the developing countries  based essentially on commodity prices  are constantly falling because of the law of the stock markets of the rich countries?""We are not inviting the rich of the world to the spectacle of our tears and lamentations so that because of their pity or compassion we may live on their largesse or their heartfelt generosity. We are simply asking that disorder and injustice give way to the establishment of a new order that respects our dignity and recognizes our demands as just.The force and passion of our appeal simply reflect the tragic backwardness of our economies  which is the result of so many centuries of foreign exploitation and domination. We know how to manage our enterprises by correcting what needs to be corrected  rectifying the mistakes that have been made and  in particular  making the sacrifices required by certain structural adjustment programmes. But  the economies of the industrialized and developed North cannot get fat on our weakness and impoverishment without imperilling their own stability. While the special session of the General Assembly held from 27 May to 1 June 1986  were able to outline the problems and take a hard look at the magnitude of the crisis and Africa's development needs - to confine myself to the agonizing turmoil of our great continent - it is for the masters of international finance and the captains of industry of the countries of the North to help us to resolve them and emerge from the backwaters of poverty and underdevelopment where we can no longer agree to suffer and languish. It is intolerable that abundance should exist side by side with the atrocious hunger  poverty and disease so characteristic of entire regions of the third world. Mankind is facing here one of the greatest challenges in its history of struggle  battles and crises. It has the capacity to meet this challenge to put an end to certain scandalous inequalities and injustices that are unacceptable in the light of the very richness of our planet and the infinite capacity of the creative genius of mankind.While the malfunctions of the world economic machine are one of the gravest causes of disquiet in our time  the world is beset by grave anomalies and dangerous anachronisms of other kinds  which all cry out for attention. To what extent is a political doctrine derived from the principles of our Charter consonant with the phenomena of oppression which we observe in the contemporary international society? How great is the gap of distortion  indeed sometimes the gulf  between what we preach and proclaim in every solemn statement and the acts that flout and trample underfoot the rights and dignity of peoples and individuals?In our continent in particular  but also elsewhere in the world  there are living large-scale examples which attest to the way in which these practices and this conduct lag behind the fervour and the cogency of our pledges of non-interference and respect for the rights  sovereignty and independence of peoples and nations.Let us look  for example  at the apartheid of the Pretoria regime. The conscience of the world as a whole has condemned this with unequalled force and no country or Government is so bold as to seek to justify or legitimise it. None the less  state racism in the purest tradition of fascism continues in the south of our continent to terrorize and slaughter and to deny the black majority its most elementary democratic and national rights. However  those who by their influence and their Immense means of bringing pressure to bear might use comprehensive mandatory sanctions  as permitted by the Charter  to bring the anachronistic champions of colonialism as it was in its days of glory to see reason and accept reality hold back and put forward ever more sophisticated arguments to support their culpable abdication of responsibility. And/ nevertheless  that same Pretoria regime/ with the support of its powerful accomplices  refuses to decolonise Namibia because the internationalist Cuban combatants - invited by independent  sovereign  Angola - would then be close to its territory. Furthermore  this group of racist usurpers practising State terrorism cherishes the open and naked ambition of destabilizing the neighbouring front-line States by means of legions of mercenaries  bombing attacks  air raids and the murder of the patriots of the African National Congress and the South West Africa People's Organization.In Mozambique  hated by Pretoria for its capacity for sacrifice and its patriotic courage  ""the bandits"" are engaging in butchery  rape and terror in a mounting wave of cruelty  all this redounding to the greater profit and welfare of apartheid.For more than 25 years Nelson Mandela  who has gone down in history as a living legend of his race  has been held hostage. For a number of months  in which South Africa's hideous face has been increasingly revealed  hundreds of black women and children have been persecuted  imprisoned  tortured and massacred by the shameful South African regime. At this session our Assembly - and not by rote or reflex - should advocate without compromise or qualification the implementation of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the Pretoria regime  which has already chosen to inflict the greatest and most humiliating sanctions on our black brothers  depriving them of their freedom and dignity as human beings  causing many premature deaths and destroying many innocent lives.In Western Sahara  can we not reconcile policy with the recognized right? Why do not Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity  through direct negotiations  bring an end to hostilities so as to create the necessary conditions for a straightforward referendum on self-determination for the Sahraoui people?As for the Palestinian people  do they not have the right to an independent homeland? The Palestine Liberation Organization  with the blood of its heroes and the sacrifices of its fighters  has won a unique place in the illustrious records of history.Benin hopes that the international conference on the Middle East will meet in the best possible circumstances  and that in a Middle East reconciled and restored to peace the Palestinian people may recover its full national rights  in 3ustice and dignity  protected from all hegemonistic designs and the illegal territorial occupation maintained and practised by the State of Israel.In Afghanistan and Kampuchea  meddling and intervention by foreign Powers should cease so that through negotiations and concerted action  led and guided by this Organization  the peoples may re-establish peace and the refugees return to their homes and their lands.Real advances are being made through diplomatic negotiation  which needs to be encouraged and supported on both these fronts so as to eliminate from our agenda in the near future these two problems which are so divisive and destructive of international harmony and understanding.In Korea  the cold-war spirit being perpetuated by military manoeuvres and a very short-sighted anti-communist campaign must be eradicated so that  through negotiation and other peaceful channels  the divided Korean people may be restored to its former unity and grandeur.Turning now to the crises and war in Central America  Benin cannot accept that the contras should be enabled to use death and terror  financed quite officially from abroad  to destabilize a sovereign country. Today  the peoples and States of the region are working together to codify and regulate their fraternal relations on the basis of good-neighbourliness and reciprocal non-interference in internal affairs. All the countries of the hemisphere  in particular the most powerful and highly developed among them  should support those efforts and co-operate in this quest for regional peace and stability.And in the case of the war in the Gulf  where so many lives are being shattered  and physical facilities and wealth blindly destroyed  will reason and tolerance finally prevail?In this very place  the most powerful among us  at first military accomplices or arms suppliers and now  in addition  principal actors  are striving jointly to bring peace once again to that precious part of the third world  today so torn and devastated. My country hopes their efforts will succeed  so that this ultimately absurd tragedy of violence and hate may not escalate and extend but may finally be resolved through an armistice and peace talks.Given the scale of the crises I have just mentioned and the violence involved  it would be tempting to give way to despair or to be deeply sceptical about the history of the world and its future  to believe that it is condemned to a fatalistic cycle of war and peace. But on earth there are inexhaustible stores of generosity  a capacity for vision and inventiveness  and even for dreaming  which should teach us to have hope  beyond the ""sound and the fury"" of our century. The main task in our Organization should be to identify lines of conduct  adapt them to new problems and realities and to put them into effect methodically and courageously as we organize our relationships on the basis of equality and co-operation among nations. In this quest for balances of international peace and understanding we  as Africans  have certain privileges confers on us by centuries of history  bondage  enslavement and oppression  endured with so much dignity and a spirit of national resistance. We are particularly well equipped  therefore  to cultivate tolerance and dialogue  while remaining jealous of our independence. We are also ready to accept differences and very vigilant regarding justice in international relations  despite the fragility - the temporary fragility - of our economies. That justice must prevail in all sectors and in all the major institutions that we have set up. Thus  in the Food and Agriculture Organization  Africa  united and in solidarity  is seeking  through the talent and competence of its candidate  our compatriot Moise Mensah  to take a leading role. Benin and the increasing number of very different States which have supported this candidacy  hope to be able to count  in a few weeks time  in Rome  on the votes of others that have not yet lent us their support.Despite the ebb and flow of the tides of war and the mounting resurgence of certain fanaticisms  we should work for times to come and plan for the future with faith and imagination.These thoughts are our modest contribution to this general debate and we invite representatives to give them their consideration. "
"11",579,"BFA",42,1987,"﻿I wish first  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the vice-presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I should be grateful if you would be good enough to convey to Ambassador Peter Florin the congratulations of our delegation on his election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. That election is a tribute both to his talents as a veteran diplomat and to his country  the German Democratic Republic  with which Burkina Faso enjoys the best possible relations. It is with genuine pleasure that I thus offer you both my congratulations and those of my delegation.Furthermore  I wish to pay a sincere and well-deserved tribute to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  who presided so successfully over the forty-first session. I take this opportunity to reaffirm our active support and encouragement for the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and an appreciation of his ceaseless and tireless efforts to defend the noble ideals of our Organization.We meet here each year to exchange views and consider together international problems and matters of common interest. We meet to seek together solutions to our problems  not only those that divide us but also those faced by each of our States individually.Unfortunately  year after year  we have gradually found ourselves in a Tower of Babel  in which the most varied languages mingle: the voice of the West  the voice of the East  the voice of the Non-Aligned  the voice of the aligned of the non-aligned - all are heard in the ensuing cacophony. Feelings of fraternity and friendship are long since dead. They have given way to the arguments of force and the language of material interests. The conduct of the economically and militarily powerful nations convinces us more and more finally each day that in the court of the international community one is guilty or innocent depending on whether one is powerful or weak. Equality  sovereignty and independence are more and more becoming words devoid of meaning.I should like to make some simple observations to illustrate this point: first  let us take participation in the general debate at the annual sessions. At these we see that the General Assembly Hall is crammed when certain delegations speak and empties with deplorable rapidity when their statements are over. To listen to these same speakers our various delegations attend in force with as many people as possible; but how many of those same delegations will be represented in this Hall by the I4inister  or even by the Permanent Representative  when it comes the turn of Burkina Faso or any of the small States to make their contribution to our debate? This conduct is not without significance. It is actually the deliberate assertion of the superiority of some over others  what else could it be  when luncheons and dinners are organized in honour of African  Asian and Latin American delegations  to which they are actually invited by those who have not even bothered to come and listen to them?Africa is indeed suffering from hunger  as ate Asia and Latin America. This is a grim reality on which we cannot turn our backs and of which we are trying to rid ourselves  but what our different continents are really suffering from is hunger for justice  liberty  independence and dignity. The sessions of the General Assembly should constitute special opportunities where a mutually enriching exchange takes place  not a jungle where might is right. Rhetorical hurly-burly  the cut-and-thrust debate  are very far from reflecting the vigorous and dynamic give-and-take which should De the form our discussions take. And this testifies to the burning desire we all share  to transform our world to serve the well—being of our peoples.Our Organization can be effective and work for peace in the world only when it is agreed in this very place to give each of our States  particularly the most underprivileged of them  the consideration they merit  not on account of what they wish they could be  but on account of what they are.I have chosen to open my statement with these somewhat  as it may appear to some  unusual words  because the inability to produce appropriate solutions to the problems besetting our world is nothing more than a true reflection of the state of our morale  as sessions succeed sessions  as statements follow statements  the chaotic situation of the world shows no visible sign of improvement: there are the same hotbeds of tension; the same crying imbalances; the same injustices; the same feats continue to weigh upon us.In spite of all we have said. President Samora Machel fell victim to our irresolution and inconsistency. Glory and honour to his memory! This dastardly and barbarous crime will not even have touched the consciences of those who set themselves up as the policemen of the world.In southern Africa there persists a situation which is an offence to human dignity  to the rules of international law  and to our Organization. The abominable Pretoria regime has succeeded in numbing the conscience of the international community and in reducing it to apathy in the face of the indescribable sufferings caused by apartheid and the odious crimes which it commits every day. Otherwise how to explain the fact that apartheid  a crime against humanity  as it has been branded here  cannot be punished as such?While some handle the situation with kid gloves  or refuse to get involved  the minority  because it is white  oppresses and does violence to  and even slaughters without scruple the majority  whose sole crime is that they are black. In this hell  the freedom fighters and the martyred black people of South Africa continue their stoic struggle.The recent strikes  which led to the foreseeable consequence of the firing of many workers  the murder of women and children and of members of the black opposition  are the latest testimony to the determination of the majority to triumph over apartheid at whatever price.The Burkinabé revolution  for its part  is resolutely committed to the support of those fighting for freedom and dignity. Thus our people has channelled its assistance to its South African brothers through an anti-apartheid struggle fund made up of voluntary contributions. Furthermore  arrangements have been made to convene in Ouagadougou/ from 8 to 11 October 1987 - in just a few days  m fact - an anti-apartheid forum. The organizing committee for this international forum is known as Bambata  in memory of the valiant South African fighter so basely murdered by the Pretoria criminals. This international meeting will we hope help to awaken the peoples of the world to the relentless struggle being waged so valiantly by the African National Congress and other liberation movements in South Africa to put an end to the heinous system of apartheid Burkina Paso  which shares the ideals of the freedom fighters in their bid to establish a multiracial and democratic society  believes  for its part  that a South Africa freed from apartheid will be of invaluable assistance for the rehabilitation and enhancement of human dignity. In this regard  permit me  as we have done in the past with regard to other countries  to welcome the decision of Canada to apply sanctions and if necessary to go so far as to break off diplomatic relations with the racist regime of South Africa.In spite of all we have said  South Africa has remained deaf to our words. In Namibia  the symbol of the powerlessness of our Organization  South Africa  with the aid of its imperialist allies and flouting Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  continues to plunder the wealth and trample underfoot the rights of the peoples to self-determination. Burkina Faso reiterates its support for the South West Africa People's Organization  the sole representative of the valiant Namibian people. Similarly  Burkina Faso reaffirms its support and active solidarity with the African brothers in the front line who  every day  are suffering from the destabilizing attacks of the Pretoria racist regime launched from Namibian territory  without those who dominate us and believe they have a world mission  even deigning to lift a finger.In spite of all we have said  we have been unable to prevent the explosion of the situation in Chad. This situation is of the greatest concern to my country  because/ without doubt  it constitutes a threat to peace and security in Africa. All peace-loving nations  particularly the members of the Organization of African Unity  must do everything in their power to create the necessary conditions for national unity in Chad  by the withdrawal of foreign troops and by the halting of all forms of foreign intervention.It is  in any case  from this standpoint  that Burkina Faso is making mediation efforts between the fraternal States of Libya and Chad  and also among the various opposing factions in the Chadian political arena. At a time when all of us are striving to do our very best to serve peace wherever it is threatened or breached  to do the work of reconciliation and to ensure that the Chadians and Libyans choose the force of argument over the argument of brutal and blind force  it is simply regrettable that - here in this very Hall certain delegations are still exploiting the sufferings of these two countries by making unconstructive statements. I say that because  if it had been that easy to decide between two States facing a frontier problem inherited from colonialism  Burkina Faso and Mali would have avoided a fratricidal war.Let us therefore leave it to the Organization of African Unity (OAJ) and give them time to pursue their efforts. The results reached by our organization at Lusaka show  if evidence is needed  that to restore confidence and peace between those two fraternal States is not beyond Africa's power  only provided that there is a will to put an end to external interference.On the question of Western Sahara  Burkina Faso’s position has not changed. Here again  more than a decade of discussion has done nothing to bring about the necessary solutions. My country hopes that Morocco will do everything necessary to make possible the success of the Secretary-General’s endeavour.We have for many years now spoken of the Middle East  in particular of the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories where the same misery persists. Yet we continue to watch  powerless or passive  or perhaps both  the application of the principle that might is right - in this case the might belongs to the Israeli occupier. Here  again  our Organization has not succeeded in granting the Palestinian people its inalienable right to an independent and sovereign State. Here  too  the powerful countries of the world have never felt it necessary to try to bring Israel to its senses by any kind of constraint.Lebanon is dying slowly - and that in spite of all we have said. More than ever we have grounds for fearing that external interference will jeopardize the very existence of the Lebanese State and the sovereignty of its people. Burkina Faso hopes that President Gemayel's appeal  made here last September  will be heeded and that  consequently  there will be as soon as possible the withdrawal of all foreign troops - with the exception  of course  of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We have been speaking for nine years now about the hotbed of tension created by the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq·  today it is the focus of attention. The world is preoccupied by it. People are talking  without the slightest embarrassment  of an embargo. No one seems to be worried or to take into account what we have said. The argument of force has become a necessity to which my country has resolutely refused to subscribe  because the motive behind this attitude is not to put an end to the loss of human life and economic damage caused by nine years of armed confrontation  not to preserve peace in the region  but to protect certain interests. I should like to remind representatives that when the question of mining Nicaraguan ports was raised there were not too many persons around who wanted to put matters right.However  we can only reiterate our urgent appeals to those two countries  to which we are bound by our common membership of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  to halt hostilities and prevent others from exploiting them to lead the world into an irretrievable situation.We take this opportunity to welcome the Secretary-General's efforts to bring peace to that part of the world. The contribution my country has always attempted to make to the search for a final solution to this conflict is aimed  first and above all  at preserving our Organization's credibility. Halting hostilities - something my country earnestly hopes for - is not and cannot be exclusive of the objective establishment of the responsibilities of the parties to the conflict.Peace in Asia remains seriously jeopardized owing to the situation in Kampuchea. We can only hope for the rapid establishment of an honourable peace for the peaceful reunification of Korea has not yet cone about  although we have been talking about it every year. The efforts undertaken to transform our quest into reality have been undermined by divisive forces emanating from outside Korea.In Afghanistan recent manifestations of national reconciliation give us grounds for hoping that that hotbed of tension will soon be extinguished. That process can only be helped by the withdrawal of Soviet troops.We have been speaking out for many years. But because we are small and have no means of coercion the arms race has been going full steam ahead. Today it. has reached pinnacles which are indeed frightening to those who yesterday were undertaking it with relish. Now the need is to disarm.As I stressed here last year  mankind's greatest tragedy at the end of the twentieth century is what super armament  particularly with nuclear weapons  has wrought. Indeed  apart from the fear caused in those who are able to measure its consequences  there is the grim reality that the arms race has devoured vast human and material resources - the very resources we should be devoting to general and complete disarmament. In this context  our hopes of seeing these resources placed at the service of development are becoming rather slim.Among the problems that this year are still undermining our world is the international economic crisis resulting from the imbalance in relations between industrialized and developing countries. Its main factors are: a hostile international environment  ever worsening terms of trade  continued decline in commodity prices  an alarming reduction in the flow of financial resources  and problems of external debt and its servicing. This last factor is without doubt the key to the crisis  because its solution  owing to a chain effect  would lead to the · solution of the other factors.

Halting hostilities - something my country earnestly hopes for - is not and cannot be exclusive of the objective establishment of the responsibilities of the parties to the conflict.Peace in Asia remains seriously jeopardized owing to the situation in Kampuchea. We can only hope for the rapid establishment of an honourable peace. Burkina Faso  whose position on this is well known  nevertheless believes that if the debt problem is to be the subject of a compromise in view of the present tendency of the debtor countries this problem will be solved by an indexation of repayments pegged to export earnings  an indexation that would take account of both the capacity to repay and the development effort of the debtor.It is clear that the current context of crisis and imbalance in the world economy make even more difficult the task of development of countries like Burkina Paso.The process of intensive development laid down two years ago to give our country an economic infrastructure still remains at the mercy of natural calamities  in spite of efforts and sacrifices made at the national level. For example  a drought is always possible  as is an invasion of locusts  and we are also at the mercy of international financing. In spite of those difficulties we have every hope of achieving certain objectives  including the creation of a communications infrastructure to help in opening up the country  and food self-sufficiency by a consistent water-supply policy and by placing emphasis on the modernization the agriculture and livestock sectors  setting up an agro-industry and  above all  fighting desertification.With regard to the last point  it is worth pointing out that for two years now our people have been waging an intensive struggle to restore the equilibrium of the ecosystem. That action has been undertaken on three fronts and has been known as ""the three struggles"". The first is a series of measures to put an end to a traditional practice which is eroding the vegetation cover: these are bush fires usually caused by peasants in the course of hunting or clearing fields. The second is an attempt to regulate the uncontrolled collecting of fire-wood in order to protect trees and forests. The third struggle concerns the moving around of animals which  owing to the effect of unorganised pasturing  is causing the destruction of the flora.Furthermore  and still in the area of the struggle against desertification  Burkina Faso envisages a vast programme of re-the forestation. This is a green belt project  because it consists of ""ringing"" the zone most heavily affected by drought with a wooded strip that could be as broad as 25 kilometres to prevent the advance of the desert. In view of its scope  such a programme will require vast resources for its implementation and these are not fully available to my country. It remains our hope that the international community will participate  effectively and efficiently  in implement ting this project  the importance of which is  I am sure  clear to everyone.In the implementation of our development process there is a factor to which Burkina Paso gives absolute priority  namely  the integration of women into all sectors.On 8 Match 1987 in Ouagadougou we celebrated the International Day of Women. On that occasion the President of the National Council of Revolution  the President of our country  Comrade Thomas Sankara  announced the forthcoming adoption of a national action plan for the Burkinabé woman. This plan of action  and I quote the President; ""far from being a catalogue of pious wishes  has to be the lightening conductor for the intensification of revolutionary action"". This will testify once again to the great importance which our people intends in future to attach to the full and total integration of women into the development process of our country.In order to ensure effective respect for this commitment  statistics will be drawn up which will necessarily indicate the part of the actions undertaken which are of benefit or concern to women. To do so - and again I quote our President: ""the question of women must be borne in mind by all decision makers at all times at all stages of the conception and execution of development action  because to conceive of a development project without the participation of women is to make use of only four fingers when you have ten  and is courting failure."" We therefore hope that very soon. Burkinabé women  finally freed from the constraints and shackles of traditional society  will be able to take any job  practise any profession  except of course the ""oldest profession in the world"" - prostitution. Indeed  in the face of the degradation of women involved in prostitution  a campaign has been begun for the rehabilitation of prostitutes.This same concern for rehabilitation inspired the campaign and accompanying measures with regard to the problem of begging. Solidarity courses have been organized in the principal towns of Burkina to take in beggars  and action has been undertaken to give those of them in a position to make use of it a minimum of job training.Both in the fight against prostitution and in the fight against begging  our aim is to improve our social habits and build for the future a new society in which men and women on an equal footing  healthy in body and mind  will live happy and dignified lives.In this new society that is being built  we should like men and women to have a healthy attitude with regard to our state of underdevelopment. Some have denigrated our decision to make use in our wearing apparel of our traditional home-grown cotton instead of the usual imported cloth. This  like the decision to consume as little as possible of imported foods and replace them by national substitutes  is something that is covered by the watchwords ""Buy Burkinabé"".Apart from the fact that this reflex is aimed essentially at awakening in the conscience of each of us a duty to protect a fragile economy because we consume too many imported products  to the detriment of national products  such conduct  if it is undertaken  cannot but have an impact on our agricultural production and our industrial production. So ""buying Burkinabé"" will go hand-in-hand with ""producing Burkinabé"". What could be more natural in the normal process of development? We have spoken  and this despite the fact that the virtue of words has not sufficed to teach us wisdom or to Inculcate in us a desire for action. It has been thus because our words have rarely been accompanied by the necessary weight to translate them into concrete action. It has been thus because very often we have spoken one way and acted just the opposite.It has been thus because  hypocritically  we have left to a Secretary-General  beset and overwhelmed by all the problems I have just described  the difficult task of ensuring the implementation of our decisions and resolutions  which we seem often to be busily undermining. It has been thus because those who have mastered science and technology have more often than not placed man at the service of progress rather than progress at the service of man.This gloomy finding should not  however  lead us into inaction. For our part  we feel that the opposite is true  because in revolution is action. It is on behalf of our revolutionary faith  on behalf of our unshakeable faith in the qualitative transformation of man that we have come and tried to communicate here with the utmost candour what we feel about the problems confronting mankind and how we view the current problems facing humanity. We hope then that at this forty-second session the General Assembly will pay more attention to constructive action than to the formulation of pious wishes and that in so doing our Organization will resolutely set out on a path that will make it possible in the near future for inequalities to be done away with  for injustice to be remedied  for fears to be overcome and for hotbeds of tension to be eliminated.

"12",622,"BGD",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  it is a marvellous feeling  one of deep gratification  to be able to address so illustrious a successor as you. For me to hand over the gavel to a person of such experience was both a pleasure and a privilege. Your election is a manifestation of the high esteem in which you are held. This recognition is most appropriate in view of your many contributions to the cause of peace  progress and multilateral co-operation. It is an honour well earned. May I offer you the assurance of my delegation's complete co-operation in the discharge of your onerous functions.Bangladesh is deeply appreciative of the significant contribution being made by our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to the effectiveness of the world body. His reappointment to a further term was a most well-deserved tribute to his dedication and commitment to the United Nations and its lofty ideals. He has earned the gratitude and respect of the international community by his humane attitude and deep understanding of global problems. We assure him of our continued full support and co-operation. I am positive the new Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs  Mr. Joseph Verner Reed  a capable diplomat of charming disposition  and his staff will be to you. Sir  a perennial source of support when you need it.The United Nations - a product of our relentless search for peace  security and development in our times and a symbol of our desire to banish forever the pangs of poverty  hunger  war and illiteracy - is a sturdy monument to the values of human civilization. The hundred million people of Bangladesh  under the bold and dynamic leadership of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad  believe that to be so. Our unflinching and abiding commitment to this Organization is based on that belief. We are happy to see signs of the restoration of global confidence in this institution. We trust that the worst is over for the ""last hope of mankind"" and that the years ahead will bring in newer assurances for the effective functioning of the United Nations system.Bangladesh has been playing an active  constructive and purposeful role in the international arena despite the many and varied constraints it confronts. Our activities in this sphere are guided by basic foreign policy objectives; first  to consolidate and safeguard our independence and sovereignty  secondly  to develop friendly bilateral  regional and international co-operation) and  thirdly  to co-operate with the global community in promoting the cause of peace  freedom and development. In pursuing these objectives  we adhere strictly and with scrupulous respect to the principles of sovereign equality of all nations  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  peaceful settlement of all disputes  and the tight of every nation to determine its own social  economic and political system.Those are the principles upon which our policies are based. Those are the values that determine our external expression.It is because of the United Nations that the world community today gives high priority to the cause of development  which in its simplest form means improving the quality of life of all people in the world  particularly those in developing countries such as our country. The United Nations has been actively involved in the process of our development since the very beginning of our nationhood. The responsiveness of the United Nations system to the needs of a country such as Bangladesh has been proved time and time again. Members are aware that my country has recently been in the grip of a devastating and unprecedented flood. Many lives have been lost and hundreds of thousands of people have been rendered homeless. Standing crops were washed away. We are grateful to the United Nations system  its agencies and the international community for a timely response with support and succour. Perhaps it is time we devised a method whereby our contemporary capabilities could be marshalled to predict and control human sufferings from such natural calamities. In this connection may I draw the attention of the General Assembly to the resolution it adopted in 1985 on ""long-term and effective solution of the problems caused by natural disasters in Bangladesh"" (resolution 40/231). It is important that the international community give serious thought to the main focus of that resolution by the United Nations system to consider a long-term and effective solution of this problem. We look forward to the guidance of the Secretary-General in this regard.Copies of the text of my statement are being distributed  wherein representatives will find the rest of what I wish to say. Mindful as I am of the financial constraints of this august body  and of the valuable time of representatives  I should like to conclude at this point. "
"13",668,"BGR",42,1987,"﻿Comrade president  allow me to congratulate you cordially upon your election to the high office of President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session. We are confident that under your able guidance the world Organization will adopt important decisions in the name of peace and the well-being of peoples.I should like to express the confidence of my country in the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and our readiness to extend to him  as we have done in the past  our fullest support in the discharge of his highly responsible mission.Each session of the General Assembly brings us closer to the twenty-first century. The age in which we live and the issues which we debate have no parallel in the history of mankind. The discovery of the secrets of the atom and the consequences of outer space are the most remarkable characteristics of the unprecedented revolution sweeping science and technology today. However  to out regret  the opportunities presented by the achievements of man's genius and talents have also been used for the needs of destruction. Mankind is now simultaneously faced with the prospect of great material and spiritual progress  and with the prospect of self-destruction. Such is the tragic paradox of our nuclear and spaceA distinguishing feature of the present phase is the scope and complexity of the problems confronting nations and States  as well as their interrelated and Sometimes conflicting interests. But for all its contradictions the present-day world is becoming ever more interconnected and unified. The threat of a nuclear Catastrophe that looms over us binds States and social systems together by a common fate. Radioactive death and ""nuclear winter"" know no boundaries  be they Geographical  State or ideological. This reality  as well as a number of other social  economic and ecological factors of global scope  have brought to the fore the necessity for new thinking and a new approach to international affairs.Security for all  mutual trust  and common efforts to build a world free of violence and war  hunger and poverty  a world of harmony between man and nature - this is the essence of the comprehensive system of international peace and security proposed by the socialist countries. Only in this way can the problem confronting mankind today be resolved. Of course  no single State or group of States can claim to offer us a faultless model for the future. My delegation is of the view  however  that the question is one of a principled approach to the problem of the survival of mankind and the continuation of civilization. By promoting and building upon a dialogue on this question which affects all peoples and States on our planet  the General Assembly could  at the current session  fulfil an important obligation to succeeding generations.The core o£ the problem of security in the nuclear age is undoubtedly to be found in the need to eliminate the material base for waging a war of destruction· Forty-two years after the explosions of two primitive - by today's standards - nuclear bombs  there are now over 50 000 nuclear warheads stockpiled in the world. New and even more lethal weapons of mass destruction are being developed. With each new round of the arms race  world security is being critically eroded  instead of strengthened. The spectre of an annihilating nuclear apocalypse  lurking in the agony of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  has increasingly haunted the conscience and consciousness of modern man.At a time when close to a trillion dollars are being squandered on the production of means of destruction annually  13 million people die of malnutrition every year. Let me recall the words of the great daughter of India  the late Indira Gandhi	""Independence and development are inseparable from disarmament and peace."" My country is deeply convinced that the implementation of real disarmament measures will not only lessen the threat to human life  but will also allow more resources to be released for its betterment.Common sense and the striving for good and creativity have never been in harmony with the philosophy and policy of violence. In keeping with the law of dialectics  the growing nuclear danger has been accompanied by a steep rise in the activity and impact of those forces that recognize the Inadmissibility  absurdity and criminal nature of nuclear war  as well as the damage done by the arms race. For a number of years now  peace and disarmament forums have been active  and talks on arms reduction and strategic stability have been under way. A turning-point in this difficult and sometimes painful process was the programme for the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000  put forward by the Soviet Union. It set forth a direct and realistic way towards a nuclear-free world. It was on this basis that the Reykjavik summit meeting became possible  creating opportunities for the first time to achieve truly significant progress in the field of disarmament.The first major breakthrough could come with the removal of the medium- and shorter-range missiles of the United States and the Soviet Union. Everyone knows what a long road has been traversed. The ""global double-zero"" proposal has in fact cleared the road ahead of all obstacles. A few days ago the world learned with great satisfaction that the two great Powers had come to an agreement in principle to do away with these types of weapons. The peoples welcome this step as a prelude to further improvement in the international climate.As the President of the Council of State of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  Todor Zhivkov  said on this occasion: ""We sincerely believe that the forthcoming signing of this treaty will not only result in the elimination of two classes of nuclear weapons for the first time in history  but will become an incentive to achieving even greater goals  ... it will have a positive effect on relations between the two States  on the East-West dialogue  on the whole international atmosphere"". The elimination of the missiles of these classes would have a major political significance for the further progress of efforts in the field of real disarmament. At the same time  we should not forget that these missiles constitute only one of the components of the overall military-strategic confrontation. The next step  one of far-reaching implications  could be a 50 per cent reduction of the strategic offensive arms under conditions of strict observance of the anti-ballistic missile Treaty.In this connection  I should like to express our firm opinion that the development and deployment of space-strike weapons offer no way out of the universally unacceptable situation of ""mutual assured destruction"". Not only will the work on the strategic defence initiative fail to slow the pace of nuclear rearmament  but it will start the development of qualitatively new arms  including third-generation nuclear weapons. It is obvious that such a system will be another extremely destabilizing addition to the already existing arsenals of offensive weapons. Its role is that of a trump card in efforts to obtain military superiority. That is why my country supports a universal ban on the deployment of weapons in outer space.The Geneva Conference is called upon to play an important role in reaching agreements on the entire spectrum of key disarmament issues. A positive element in its recent work is the progress made on the question of banning chemical weapons. There are increasingly real prospects for agreement on the text of a relevant convention. The People's Republic of Bulgaria will do its utmost to assure the successful conclusion of this work. We sincerely hope that the positive resolution of this extremely important problem will not be blocked by unilateral actions aimed at chemical rearmament.It has long been recognized that the complete cessation of nuclear-weapons tests is both an urgent need and a prerequisite for closing other channels of the arms race. Through its unilateral moratorium  which lasted for more than a year and a half  the Soviet Union has demonstrated in practice that it is ready to take immediate practical steps in this field. There is certain cause for optimism in the agreement reached at the meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the USSR and the USA  Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr. Shultz  to start bilateral talks  the final goal of which would be to achieve a general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapons testing.Ensuring security through disarmament is not confined only to the elimination of nuclear weapons and other means of mass destruction. It also implies the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces to the minimum level required for defence. The Declaration of the member States of the Warsaw Treaty  adopted at Budapest  contains a realistic programme of radical measures on conventional disarmament and on the reduction of military confrontation ""from the Atlantic to the Urals"". We believe that the Informal consultations between the members of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  which began at Vienna  will develop into serious negotiations to resolve major long-term issues.The socialist countries do not limit the system of security to the military-political area alone  but view it also as a complex of relationships encompassing the economic  social  humanitarian and ecological fields  in the final analysis  the goal of our peace initiatives is to furnish genuinely humane living conditions for nations and individuals  to preserve man as the greatest value of life and as the creator of wealth and progress.The universal efforts designed to guarantee human rights and to promote international co-operation in the social and humanitarian fields should  as a whole  be aimed at the ""humanization"" of international relations  at their democratisation  and at providing moral and social guarantees for the maintenance of peace. To pave the way for all this  concerted and enduring efforts will obviously be needed to reaffirm the ideas of peace  disarmament and international security  to increase the scope of mutual knowledge and understanding and to translate the natural right of every human being to live in conditions of peace and freedom into a fundamental norm of international life.An indispensable condition for the ""humanity"" of international relations and the protection of human rights as an element o£ international security is to ensure the right of every nation freely and without outside interference to determine its own future  to select its social system  to manage its natural resources and to participate in the International division of labour on an equal and just basis. It is equally evident that in order to build a more humane and safer world it is imperative that we eradicate apartheid  racism  aggressive chauvinism  racial discrimination and religious intolerance. It is necessary to eliminate those deep-rooted social and political factors which generate massive violations of human rights. In other words  International co-operation in the humanitarian and social sphere is feasible  necessary and useful on the basis of an integrated approach to the question of human rights - collective and individual  political and socio-economic alike. We support the proposal to convene in Moscow a representative conference of the States parties to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) which would consider the full range of humanitarian questions as a unified whole  including the issues of human contacts  information  culture and education.It is impossible to imagine a stable international system without equitable and mutually advantageous economic co-operation. It is necessary to eliminate all kinds of discrimination  to alleviate the debt burden of developing countries as much as possible and to restructure the international monetary system.There is a universal need for concerted action to deal with the aftermath of natural disasters  to protect the environment and natural resources and to fight disease and the spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic.No less urgent is the need for wide-ranging international co-operation to combat crime and particularly international terrorism. The People's Republic of Bulgaria reaffirms its readiness to contribute towards the co-ordination of effective measures  including those within the framework of the United Nations  to stem this ugly and dangerous phenomenon. We should further strengthen effective measures against the illicit production  trafficking in and abuse of narcotic drugs on a global scale. In this respect too  Bulgaria  which is located at a busy international crossroads  has been working diligently and unswervingly  endeavouring to protect the physical and mental health of its own citizens and of foreign nationals endangered by this scourge of modern-day civilization.We need not mention all the spheres in which co-operation is possible. It is important to emphasize that such opportunities do exist  however  and that our use of them depends  first and foremost  on our overall readiness to take a fresh look at problems and to give up worn-out stereotypes. The question before us today is not ""Who benefits from co-operation?""  for the answer to that question is clear: everyone does  the whole world benefits from co-operation. The question that we must ask is ""What shall we lose if we do not undertake such co-operation?"" Perhaps some still delude themselves  but the answer to this question is no less unequivocal: we all risk losing everything.Inspired by its positions of principle on the cardinal basic issues of peace  security and co-operation  the People's Republic of Bulgaria has been actively engaged in the all-European process. My country has put forward a number of specific initiatives at the Vienna meeting of the States parties to the Helsinki Conference. At this stage  the principal task of that meeting remains the transition from deliberations to the elaboration of the concrete elements of a future final document.I should like to recall that a remarkable anniversary is soon to be commemorated by all of mankind - the seventieth anniversary of the great October socialist revolution - for it was that event which brought about a revolution in international affairs and established for the first time practical conditions for the democratisation of international relations and for peaceful coexistence. The new political thinking that is steadily gaining support today means approaching each international problem from the standpoint of finding a generally acceptable solution to it and not viewing it only through the prism of dogma and military-strategic interests. No single State  no matter how powerful  has the right to make unilaterally decisions upon which the fate of entire countries and peoples depends. Existing conflicts should not be settled by the dictate of force. As Mikhail Gorbachev noted in his article devoted to the opening of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly; ""new rules of coexistence on our unique planet are called for  in keeping with the new requirements and the changed circumstances"".Only through dialogue  responsible behaviour  sincere collective efforts and co-operation can problems be resolved wherever conflicts exist and wherever there is danger to peace and security in a particular region and throughout the world.The situation in the Persian Gulf region is of particular concern. The bloody war between Iraq and Iran has already been raging for almost seven years and has brought untold suffering to those peoples  with both of which we have ties of friendship. The position of Bulgaria is one of principle and is consistent. The war conflicts with the interests of both countries; it provides conditions for selfish interference from outside and threatens unpredictable escalation of the crisis. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council  Bulgaria was involved in the preparation and adoption of resolution 598 (1987). The complete implementation of this resolution would be the best guarantee of a peaceful political settlement of the contentious issues. We support the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his responsible mission to find a just solution to the problem.A comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Middle East conflict should not be delayed any longer. Reaffirming our well-known position on this question  we express our hope for the removal of the obstacles to the convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)   as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The hotbed of tensions in Central America persists. That is why we consider the procedure for establishing lasting peace in Central America adopted by the Presidents of the five Central American countries to be timely and necessary. The series of peace initiatives by the Contadora Group and the Support Group also play an important role in efforts to eliminate this hotbed of tension.The People's Republic of Bulgaria calls for the immediate elimination of the disgraceful system of apartheid and the illegal occupation of Namibia r for strict implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and for the ending of the brutal aggression by Pretoria against the African States.In close proximity to the borders of Bulgaria  the situation in Cyprus remains a source of danger to peace and security in the region. This is a classic example of aggression against and occupation and annexation of part of a sovereign country. As a Balkan State  the People's Republic of Bulgaria is keenly interested in the attainment of a just and lasting settlement of the question of Cyprus. The way out of the existing situation is offered by the proposal to convene an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations. The internal aspects of the problem must obviously be dealt with by peaceful means  including negotiations  taking into account the legitimate interests of the indigenous population of Cyprus and the integrity  sovereignty and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus.The People's Republic of Bulgaria supports the constructive policy of the Afghan Government  which is aimed at restoring peace in the interests of an independent  non-aligned Afghanistan. We believe that the policy of national reconciliation in Kampuchea is in the best interests of the people of that country. The People's Republic of Bulgaria supports the initiatives in favour of the peaceful and democratic reunification of Korea  as well as the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to declare the Korean peninsula a nuclear-weapon-free zone.It is stated in the Charter of the United Nations and confirmed by practice in international affairs that regional security is an important ingredient of overall international security. In this connection 1 should like to emphasize the particular importance we attach to the situation in the Balkans. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is working with determination to strengthen the positive trends in relations among the Balkan States and to establish confidence and good-neighbourly relations in our region. The proposal of the People's Republic of Bulgaria that bilateral agreements be concluded containing a code of good-neighbourly relations  renunciation of territorial claims and provisions concerning the non-use of the territory of one country for hostile purposes against another and its other initiatives in the area of bilateral and multilateral co-operation are all well known. Equally well known is our idea that  as a first step in that direction  bilateral agreements on the non-use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes that endanger peace and security should be concluded.The People's Republic of Bulgaria is a principled and steadfast proponent of the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. We are profoundly and firmly convinced that the transformation of the Balkan peninsula into a zone free of nuclear and chemical weapons would contribute to improving the climate in the region  in Europe and in the world  and that it would be fully in the interests of the Balkan peoples. We are making every practical effort to this end. We have also proposed that the Balkan States conclude an agreement on the ecological protection of the peninsula and are ready to take practical steps in that directionThe United Nations has been entrusted with the unique mission of maintaining peace and security. We cannot conceive of the present-day structure of international relations and their peaceful development without the crucial contribution of the United Nations· Nor can we imagine that the major global problems ranging from disarmament to humanitarian issues could be resolved without its involvement. Bulgaria has always supported and will continue to support the activities of the world Organization and strive to contribute to the best of its ability to the strengthening of its effectiveness.The foreign policy of the People's Republic of Bulgaria which is shaped by the highest national interests of our people and the nature of our socialist system  fully reflects the dynamic processes of thorough restructuring and accelerated growth which are under way in our country today. I have in mind the increasing effectiveness of our national economy r the growing democratisation of our social and political life and the radical improvement in the living and cultural standards of our people. We openly discuss our concerns and problems with the rest of the world  we offer our sincere help wherever we can help and we welcome the co-operation of those more experienced and advanced than we are. Our internal reforms provide new  propitious opportunities for the international activities of our country and facilitate more active co-operation with our partners at all levels and in all fields. As I have already mentioned  the principal aim of that co-operation is to promote in every possible way friendly ties with all countries  in the name of peace  security and the free and independent development of peoples  and of the prosperity and progress of mankind.I reaffirm that the People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue to pursue its policy unwaveringly  a policy which is in harmony with the purposes and principles of the United Nations."
"14",713,"BHR",42,1987,"﻿Allow me at the outset to offer you  Sir  the sincerest congratulations of the delegation of the State of Bahrain on your assumption of the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I should like to assure you of the full co-operation of my delegation in discharging the duties of your high office.I take this opportunity also to express my thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  for the competence and prudence he displayed in guiding the proceedings of the forty-first session and for the great efforts he exerted towards its success.I should also like to express deep appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his relentless efforts to enhance both the role of the Organization and its efficiency in fulfilling its international responsibilities for the well-being of the world community and in the interests of freedom and global peace.This year the United Nations General Assembly is meeting as the spectre of war looms large over different parts of the world and as political  social and economic problems worsen by the day. Faced with such conditions  our only consolation could well be our faith in man's ability to adjust to reality and in his insistence on contending with difficulties in the hope of overcoming his troubles and solving his problems. It was in response to this will on the part of man that the United Nations came into being  to seek solutions for such problems and to meet the challenges in order to save the world from the scourge of war and the perils of chronic economic crises. Today's world is shackled to the bonds of tension and threats of war. Troubled international relations have become a characteristic of our times and a dangerous phenomenon threatening the future of coming generations. Although the Charter of the United Nations proclaims the fundamental and main objective of the Organization to be the prevention of future wars and specifies that international relations should be based on co-operation  interdependence and mutual respect  as well as on the principles of good-neighbourliness  aggression and hegemonism continue to be dominating trends in the contemporary world  thus further complicating matters year after year.With peace and development being the main preoccupations of this world  one cannot but feel frustrated at seeing  after many years  the same major international problems still being inscribed on the agenda of this Organization  with no concrete progress being made towards their resolution  even though the majority of the international community recognizes the danger they constitute to the stability and security of mankind. Thus  if this year  as in previous years  we are meeting to consider our common political and economic issues driven by hope and brought together by a resolute determination to solve our problems in order to establish international relations based on justice and equity# then our deliberations and points of view must rise to the level of our responsibility  in accordance with our commitments under the provisions of the United Nations Charter.A cause for optimism and satisfaction on our part is the marked improvement in the relations of the two super-Powers. This no doubt creates a better international climate for promoting confidence and building bridges between East and West  in particular as regards the elimination of medium-range missiles and their nuclear warheads. This should pave the way towards finding solutions to the major international problems which threaten peace and security reducing military tensions and easing the political crises in various parts of the globe. The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations provided an excellent opportunity to discuss the achievements of the world Organization since its inception in 1945  its success in solving certain important political problems and its enormous efforts in the various areas of economic  social and cultural co-operation  thus affirming its natural role as an international forum for dialogue and consultation among States and for the peaceful settlement of their disputes. The United Nations system and specialized international organizations also played a prominent role in the fields of decolonisation  human rights  development  the status of women  health  education  mother and child care  the problems of refugees  the environment and population  in addition to the many other areas of economic  social and cultural co-operation  too numerous to recall here.Profound political and economic changes have taken place since the inception of the United Nations. In the 1960s  the decolonisation process resulted in an increasing number of newly-independent States joining the membership of the Organization  thereby causing a change in its composition and the balance of power within it. Thus  the United Nations shifted from a system controlled of a limited number of States to a more democratic one in which the Movement of Non-Aligned -countries played a distinctive and prominent role. The 1973 also  brought forth changes  in the political and economic fields. Deliberations on the establishment of a new international economic order acquired political and economic dimensions never before experienced by the United Nations  especially after the emergence of interdependence as a reality and its positive effects in the area of multilateral co-operation  which we have been experiencing and living with every day. Some may hold the conviction that in its present state  the United Nations does not fulfil the role entrusted to it by the Charter  particularly in the realm of the maintenance of international peace and security. However  objectivity dictates that no judgement  whether in favour of or against the Organization  should be made until there has been a less abstract and more precise examination based on an evaluation of the conditions under which the Organization was created and the nature and limits of the authority and powers accorded to it  in the light of the political events and the circumstances of international relations then prevailing. It is difficult to deny that even when the United Nations has been unable to achieve decisive results in solving some important problems  because of the circumstances of international conflict  it nevertheless has succeeded in reducing tensions and crystallizing world public opinion through collective diplomacy  which  in view of the intertwining of international relations  is the only method capable of settling disputes by peaceful means.We live in a fast-developing world. Technological advances proceed at such a pace that it is hard to keep up with them. Thus  despite relentless attempts on the part of the United Nations to modernize and develop methods that respond to international changes  it has not always been able to keep abreast of the multitude of new technologies. There exists a gap between the rate at which the world is developing and the ability of the United Nations and its institutions to keep pace with certain scientific developments. We therefore believe that concerted efforts within the framework of the international Organization to explore urgently the best ways to adapt to today's world have become a pressing necessity. The United Nations is here to stay. We must support it and help it evolve into what we meant it to be; a mechanism that can keep step with technological and scientific progress  as well as an instrument for economic development and for the maintenance of peace  security and stability in the world.We speak of the lofty purposes and noble principles enunciated in the United Nations Charter as being the basis of conduct by States and of the peaceful settlement of disputes between them  in conformity with the principles of international law  while in several regions of the world international security continues to be threatened. The Arabian Gulf region  in particular  has for the past seven years been suffering from the scourge of a senseless war whose dangers have increased as its scope has widened and whose flames have been fanned to such an extent that the war is almost out of control and is becoming difficult to contain. For seven years the entire Gulf region has been living in a state of tension and disquiet as a result of the continuation of this war  which has seriously jeopardized the region's security and changed its peaceful and tranquil life into a life of strain and turmoil - first because of the threats to international maritime routes and then because of the attacks on commercial vessels  the laying of marine mines  and the various dangers of destruction to which the people of the region are exposed.Thus  there has arisen a constant danger to freedom of international navigation. As a result  many nations now maintain a heavy military presence in the region  which could cause grave developments. In addition  Iran's shelling with rockets of residential areas south of Kuwait and the abuse of religious rites of pilgrimage in the Holy City of Mecca by Iranian pilgrims have led to an escalation of tensions  which could further complicate the war and widen its scope. The Co-operation Council of the Arab States of the Gulf has warned of the consequences of such a destructive war and expressed its willingness to undertake any peaceful endeavour aimed at ending the war. Time is precious. We feel that we have entered the countdown stage  and the search for a just and speedy solution to this bloody war between Iran and Iraq has therefore now become even more compelling.We repeat today what we have already frequently stated: The lessons of history and experience teach us that this war does not serve the interest of either party to the conflict or of any of the other States of the region. Hence  we regard Security Council resolution 598 (1987) - which specified that the bases for · a comprehensive settlement of the conflict between the two sides were a cease-fire and withdrawal to international borders - as a most important endeavour emanating from the conscience of the international community  an expression of its increased concern over this dangerous war.In that context  we applaud the positive response of brotherly Iraq to the regional and international appeals and initiatives  in which it expressed its willingness to implement Security Council resolutions 582 (1986) and 598 (1987). We also once again address a sincere appeal to Iran to comply with the international will and to the endeavours of the Secretary-General by implementing  in its entirety and as an indivisible whole. Security Council resolution 598 (198 7) calling for an end to the war. We are hopeful that the Security Council will maintain its unanimity with respect to the implementation of that resolution without delay  and impose on the non-complying party the sanctions called for in the Charter  in order to put an end once and for all to this tragic conflict.The question of Palestine has two basic dimensions: the land and the people. Both are still prey to the avaricious designs of Israel and world Zionism  within the framework of an international colonialist conspiracy aimed at Palestine  the land and the people - a conspiracy which  since 1948  Israel has used to wage successive wars of aggression against the Palestinian territories and the territories of other neighbouring Arab States.The great tragedy forced on the Palestinian people is that of a people deprived of its homeland  driven out of its homes and forced to live dispersed in exile  in conditions of injustice  suppression  persecution and expulsion  constantly subjected to attempts to obliterate its Palestinian personality and identity  desecrate its Holy Places  confiscate its property  plunder its natural  resources and deprive it of all means for a decent life. And all this is done while Israel continues illegally to establish settlements in the West Bank  the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. Despite the many resolutions adopted by the Security Council in this respect  including resolutions 242 (1967) and 330 (1973) - which stressed the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by the use of armed force and clearly demanded the withdrawal of the invading forces from the occupied Arab territories and a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict by peaceful means under the auspices of the United Nations - Israel has not complied with the international will and has continued its aggression by occupying more and more Arab territories. The same arrogance  insolence and total disregard for resolutions has been apparent in the treatment that Israel has accorded those adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and other international organizations which have recognized the legitimate and inalienable right of the Palestinian people to return  and their rights to exercise self-determination and establish their own State on their soil and homeland  like all other peoples of the world.Just as Israel has rejected the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly on the question of Palestine  so too has it ignored the many United Nations resolutions condemning its aggression against Lebanon. It has refused to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions  in particular resolutions 501 (1982) and 508 (1982)  calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territories invaded in 1982. Israel continues to this very moment to occupy areas along the entire length of the southern border of Lebanon  spreading destruction there and practising against its innocent population the roost abhorrent kinds of injustice and torture. What I have just said I· not intended to open the files on the question of Palestine  which is well-documented in the records of the United Nations and with which most members are familiar. Rather  it is meant to draw attention to the gravity of the present situation in the Middle East as a result of the aggressive and expansionist policies still pursued by Israel regardless of the resolutions of the international Organization in this respect. However  if the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly are insufficient to deter Israel  it becomes the responsibility of the entire international community to take a clear and unequivocal stand against such total disregard of  and shameless indifference to  the Organization  its Charter and its resolutions. Desirous of preserving the peace and security of the region  the Arab States declared  in the Fez Plan of 1982  their acceptance of the peaceful settlement of the Arab—Israeli dispute under the aegis of the United Nations and in accordance with its relevant resolutions. Such a constructive step by the Arab States received no positive response from Israel  which even refrained from proposing any international formula for ending the state of war  thus renouncing all international customs and laws. In the face of such an arrogant Israeli attitude   we believe there can be no alternative but to support the decision of the General Assembly in resolution 38/58 C of 13 December 1983  which calls for convening the peace conference on the Middle East  under the auspices and supervision of the United Nations with the participation  on an equal footing  of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The confidence and respect which the United Nations commands make it the only international forum capable of finding a comprehensive and just solution to the problem.Our principled position on the Afghanistan question has already been clarified at previous sessions. It is based on our adherence to the principles embodied in the Charter  which prohibit the threat or use of force in international relations and renounce all forms of intervention  armed or otherwise  by any State in the internal affairs of another. We believe that the only way to settle this question peacefully is through the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and respect for the right of the Afghan people to choose freely  without any foreign pressure or interference  the political  social and economic system to which they aspire.The minority regime in South Africa continues to apply its abhorrent system of apartheid and to practise all kinds of suppression and persecution against the black majority  which constitutes a crime against humanity and a gross violation of fundamental human rights. Its continued illegal occupation of Namibia is an outrageous challenge to the resolutions of both the Security Council and the General Assembly. In addition  its repeated attacks against its neighbours/ in open aggression against the sovereignty of States Members of this Organization  is convincing evidence of the disregard that regime holds for all principles and international conventions  demanding a firm stand by the entire international community against such challenges and inhuman practices.The so-called reforms which have recently been adopted by the Government o£ South Africa  claiming that they would cause detente in racial relations  have not resulted in any improvement in the political situation of the black majority in South Africa nor in their living conditions. Thus the measures adopted by the Pretoria regime in past years have proved a failure in effecting any real reforms with regard to equality of rights between the black majority and the white minority. Moreover  the policy of apartheid still forms the core of the political thought of the Pretoria regime. We believe there will be no way out of this abnormal and inhuman situation until the black majority attain their political rights in full. As regards Namibia  the State of Bahrain is still convinced that the only basis for an internationally acceptable solution to the question is specified in the United Nations plan  as embodied in Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978).Despite the rapid spread of technology  the successive scientific advances in various fields and the notable increase in agricultural productivity  the gap between the developed and developing countries la still widening  while underdevelopment and poverty are daily on the rise in the developing world. The deep economic depression which hit the world in the inid-197ü8 and the early 1980s had negative effects on the economic and social conditions in the developing countries. The situation further worsened when the economic recovery which the developed countries had been witnessing in recent years failed to cause a parallel recovery in the economies of the developing countries.This deterioration in the world economic situation necessitates a radical solution to the problems of recession and depression  which had serious adverse effects on the economic and social development plans in the developing countries and increased the wide gap between the standards of living in the countries of the North and the South. The economic situation in the least-developed countries has acquired tragic dimensions  owing .to the fragility of their economies and their dependence on foreign aid  which make them extremely vulnerable to any unfavourable changes in the world economy. We believe that the policies and measures arrived at during the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)   with a view to addressing the problems facing the world economy  merit all our attention since they undoubtedly could  if implemented  contribute to the revitalization of development  economic growth and international trade.	.	.The dangers facing the international monetary system as a result of the foreign debt burden of the developing countries  amounting to $1 trillion  is another problem which  owing to the current crisis and receding economic growth rates  is an ever-worsening one.The debt problems  between the North and the South can  in our view  be contained through the integration of the developing countries into the international trade system and strengthening its financial and economic ties. It is to be hoped that the competent organs of the United Nations  such as UNCTAD  will play  with the co-operation of such specialized agencies as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  an active and positive role in improving the international economic situation and assisting the developing countries  in order to create a better world  where prosperity and well-being are prevalent.Neither the substantial scientific and technological accomplishments nor the tremendous advances in the field of communication and transportation have  regrettably  helped in achieving the desired understanding among States. Mankind has never been confronted with a greater danger than the one it now faces. Not only does the global arms race today threaten the future of mankind with destruction  but it can also lead to its extinction. The enormous stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the major Powers are capable of erasing all traces of life on this planet in a few seconds  and therein lies the importance of the United Nations and its role as an instrument for finding the most appropriate formula for co-operation and coexistence among the countries of the world  on the basis of mutual trust and security.As we approach the threshold of the twenty-first century  let us not lose sight of the fact that all peoples of the world are inhabitants of one planet  and that our future and common fate depend on the extent of our co-operation in finding a way out of our insecure present to a more radiant and optimistic tomorrow.Thanks to the humane purposes and noble principles of our Organization  there are gathered under its umbrella today all the peoples of the world  irrespective of their differing political  economic and social systems. My delegation hopes  therefore  that the present session will adopt the appropriate decisions necessary to confront those global problems which  if not met with organized collective action  can have disastrous consequences for mankind. We also hope that the United Nations efforts to maintain peace  realize justice and provide security for the nations of this world will meet with success and that Member States will exert their utmost efforts to ensure that all human resources are utilized for the benefit of mankind and not wasted on the arms race or the manufacture of weapons of destruction·Once again I reiterate that my country  Bahrain  stands ready to co-operate fully with the other Member States in order to achieve for our peoples those goals of freedom  well-being and progress to which we all aspire; to promote international efforts aimed at establishing a just  comprehensive and durable peace  in accordance with the lofty objectives and principles of the Charter; to strengthen international co-operation in the economic  social and cultural fields j and to build a better  more secure world wherein prosperity  progress and development prevail.

"15",751,"BHS",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and on my own behalf  I extend warm congratulations to you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of this Assembly. My delegation  aware of your competence and experience in diplomacy  is confident that important agreements can be reached on many of the problems facing our Member States. I take this opportunity also to commend Foreign Minister Choudhury of Bangladesh for the skilful manner in which he conducted the business of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.On 19 June the Bahamas electorate returned my Government to an unprecedented sixth term of office. This vote has given my Government a strong mandate to continue to promote effective programmes for the economic development and political stability of the Bahamas. As a result of this vote  my Government can continue to use its voice and energies for the advancement of this great world forum.My Government therefore takes this opportunity to encourage our Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  in his leadership role in this Organization  to implement measures that would elicit greater co-operation among States  thereby minimizing confrontation.There are perennial problems on the United Nations agenda  such as those of the world economic situation  the debt  drug trafficking and abuse  disarmament  regional conflicts and  in Africa  apartheid  political unrest  economic stagnation  drought and famine which beset much of the continent. The African Problems defy easy solutions because of an unwillingness to join fully in the war on apartheid on the part of those countries which could do the most to effect change.I shall  however  be focusing only on those issues in respect of which my delegation feels it can offer some suggestions or practical observations which will contribute to progress in their resolution. In this vein  I should like to address first the issue of small States  especially their economic viability and security. In the final analysis  the question is not whether small States are viable entities  history has already answered this question in the affirmative. The crux of the matter  in fact  is that if ambivalence continues to prevail in respect of small States they do then become burdens. All of us have heard the wise observation give a man a fish and you feed him for a day  teach a man how to fish and you feed him for life. Small States need only understanding  patience and productive assistance. We  in the category of small States have identified goals and projects in respect of which such requirements should be met. We have some of the tools to attain our goals and fulfil our projects. What we now need is the means to improve these tools and the forbearance to let us work out our own destiny.Within the special category of small States is an even more specialized grouping of States that require particular attention and understanding on the part of the international community. This is the grouping of island developing States  to which geography has bequeathed more constraints in relation to their size than blessings. In addition to economic and social burdens  such as dependence on one or a few commodities  external debt and a shortage of administrative personnel  which beset other developing States  island States face not only smallness of size but remoteness and sometimes great distance from market centres  constraints in transportation  a limited internal market and general lack of natural or traditionally viable natural resources. Nevertheless  if permitted to enjoy an effective level of self-reliance as well as internal stability  small States can strengthen rather than threaten international order  peace and collective security.Another year has passed and the abhorrent apartheid regime of South Africa persists  despite increased pressure by the international community  as well as the private sector  through resolutions  calls for divestment  demonstrations  sanctions and embargoes. World public opinion has swung firmly to our side? it is clear that the Botha regime has lost the struggle in psychological terms  but there are still many obstacles to overcome. The poison of Pretoria continues to affect the neighbouring country of Namibia  which cries out for its rightful place as an independent State in the international community.It is time for us  the people  to face the effects of complicity when it comes to South Africa and Namibia. If we do not  we all become as guilty of oppression and murder as those States which back away from exercising economic pressure and political influence on South Africa.In 1985 the Commonwealth Heads of Government  meeting in Nassau  came to grips with South Africa's intransigence with regard to dismantling apartheid. Under the chairmanship of Sir Lynden Pindling  Prime Minister of the Bahamas  the Heads of Government appointed the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group on Southern Africa. For six months in 1986  in which its members travelled extensively in southern Africa  the Eminent Persons Group worked to promote a process of dialogue for change  ending apartheid and establishing a genuine non-racial democracy in South Africa. Sadly  the Government of South Africa listened  but did not hear: acknowledged  but did not act. Consequently  the Commonwealth convened a mini-summit of seven countries in London to attempt to place increased pressure on South Africa.With Sir Lynden Pindling as Chairman  the Governments of India  Canada  Australia  Zimbabwe  Britain  Zambia and the Bahamas reaffirmed a commitment to the Commonwealth accord on southern Africa concluded at Chogm in Nassau. Because of Pretoria's unwillingness to negotiate  the group of seven  with the exception of Britain  agreed to adopt economic measures against South Africa as a moral and political imperative. When Commonwealth Heads of Government convene in Vancouver next week  the Bahamas assuredly will be in the forefront of the fight for racial equality and freedom in all southern Africa.In the view of the Bahamas there must be unqualified acceptance of the urgent need for action to dismantle apartheid in South Africa. Meaningful measures must also incorporate practical commitment to infrastructural issues such as the abolition of discriminatory education. In that context  the Bahamas Government welcomed and supports  through contributions to the Commonwealth Secretariat  the Commonwealth South Africa Scholarship Fund  which administers the Commonwealth Nassau Fellowships established at the 1985 meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in the capital of the Bahamas to help educate South Africans disadvantaged by apartheid  so that they can acquire the skills likely to be required for the progress of a post-apartheid South Africa. The Bahamas Government has also consistently supported United Nations programmes for oppressed and refugee South Africans  including the United Nations Fund for Namibia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.Also  to curb significantly front-line States' economic dependence on South Africa and to safeguard their security against South African aggression it is imperative that assistance to these States be increased. Apart from the question of economic dependency on South Africa  the security of front-line States is constantly being violated by South Africa either by direct aggression or by material assistance to armed opposition within front-line States. It has been ascertained not only that South Africa uses internal and external aggression to frighten front-line States into abandoning their support for the black majority  but also that it exploits their economic dependence through the jobs given to nationals of front-line States. Further  the provision of those jobs ignores mass unemployment among black South Africans  depresses the general wage level and enables the South African Government to maintain control of the labour force. To assist in curbing front-line States' economic dependence on South Africa  the Bahamas has contributed financially to United Nations programmes as well as to the non-aligned fund for the front-line States.To ignore the elements just enumerated is to nullify the sacrifices  personal and financial  which many nations  organizations and individuals have made with a view to dismantling apartheid. It could contribute to the fire of revolution  which could make ashes of the achievements of the billions of dollars from Western developed nations invested in South Africa. Moreover  it could cause the poison of Pretoria to suffocate forever the independence and freedom of Namibia. Therefore  despite the attention now being focused on the internal situation in South Africa  renewed emphasis must be placed on the blueprint for the independence of Namibia contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1970).In 1985 the world economy slowed down  and in 1986 aid so again. That  of course  was to the detriment of many developing countries  particularly those in Africa. Developing countries with the least amount of economic diversity have suffered the most as a result of this worsening situation. Overwhelmed by foreign debt  many of these developing countries find themselves in unstable domestic situations and with negative growth entrenching itself as a way of life.Compare that debilitating economic scenario of developing countries with the situation of the developed market economies  which experienced growth in per capita income in 1986. This is a picture that does not say much for the implementation by the United Nations of the economic principles of its Charter.The correct path was indicated to us at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The consensus document that emanated from that session can serve as a significant guiding light for the international community in efforts to rectify the world economy. I wish to underscore here its prescriptions for sustainable and non-inflationary growth in developed countries and an environment conducive to accelerated growth for developing countries. Those prescriptions are a co-operative and flexible strategy on the question of international debt  a halt to protectionist policies and the shouldering by industrialized countries of their responsibility to foster a more stable and predictable economic environment  especially in the area of commodity prices.The Bahamas Government continues to direct a strong appeal to the super-Powers to work together to reach mutually satisfactory bilateral accords. These should be supported by complementary arms-control agreements extending to other nuclear  militarily significant. States. Serious efforts at arms control must also be accompanied by such meaningful acts as the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and the abolition of the use of chemical weapons. The World Disarmament Campaign and the world disarmament conference proposed in paragraphs 15 and 122  respectively  of the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  constitute golden opportunities for challenging the people of the world  young and old  to make a concrete contribution to disarmament  or at the very least to global agreement that arms at their lowest quantitative and qualitative levels must be only the last resort in conflicts among nations.There are at present encouraging signs that the United States and the Soviet Union  aided by the courageous and historic commitment of Chancellor Kohl of the Federal Republic of Germany  are on the verge of an agreement which could draw the world back from the threat of the use of nuclear weapons. My Government applauds these rare acts of political will in the interest of national and international security. The benefits to the world of reduced spending on armaments are incalculable. The Bahamas would support all measures aimed at disarmament-fuelled development  especially those that would enable the expertise and technology now expended on the arms race to be applied to global problems such as pollution control  prevention of disease and other projects which only await funding. The Bahamas supports disarmament-fuelled development to bring all people everywhere an acceptable standard and quality of life.The situations in Afghanistan and in Central America  to cite two glaring examples  are instructive in that they both illustrate that rigid adherence to spheres of influence by the two super-Powers in the context of balance-of-power politics does not contribute to a stable world order.The Bahamas  therefore  continues to call for the total withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and additionally submits that the negotiation of agreed guarantees for the restoration of non-alignment to Afghanistan is perhaps the only enduring solution to the internal suffering and political stalemate which the conflict in that beleaguered country has produced. The Bahamas is heartened by the demonstration of political will in the Central American sub-region  which has followed the direction and the intensive efforts of the Contadora Group and its Support Group to find a peaceful solution to the intra-regional conflict.The Bahamas  therefore  welcomes the Central American Presidents' plan on procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America  signed on 7 August  and the act of installation of the International Verification and Follow-up Commission  signed 15 days later by their Foreign Ministers  the Contadora Group and Support Group countries and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States. Both these initiatives merit maximum international support as evidence of genuine commitment to the restoration of peace in Central America. In this context  the Bahamas therefore encourages relevant United Nations organs  such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to offer every practical assistance to Central American Governments at every stage of the implementation timetable for the peace plan. Given the serious economic and social problems which are to a large extent the root causes of conflicts in Central America  international assistance is a crucial element if peace is to result from a return to the path of progress through economic and social justice.The resolve of the international community to counteract the devastating and destructive phenomena of drug abuse and illicit trafficking has resulted in unprecedented drug control initiatives. The most significant effort in recent years was the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (ICDAIT) held in Vienna earlier this year  ICDAIT successfully brought together those in the forefront of drug control - representatives from the United Nations system. Governments and intergovernmental organizations. Of equal importance was the spirit of compromise and co-operation that guided the work of the Conference and resulted in the adoption by consensus of its principal documents - the comprehensive multidisciplinary outline and a Declaration.The momentum of ICDAIT also had a positive effect on the work of the intergovernmental group of experts which met immediately after the Conference to begin work on a new convention against illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.The success of efforts such as ICDAIT and the new convention ought not be measured simply in terms of consensus documents. The level of success will become evident with time as Governments exercise the political will expressed in the Declaration and implement through regional and national legislation and practices  the measures recommended in the comprehensive multi-disciplinary outline  as well as the Treaties and relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations on drug abuse control.The Bahamas will remain part of this struggle against drug abuse and drug trafficking because it believes that in the interests of domestic  social and global stability the war against drugs must be won.By way of conclusion I wish to remind members that we are living on a shrinking planet  made so by technological breakthroughs in communication  transportation and science. It is self-evident that decisions taken at the United Nations can be transmitted technologically and through direct personal intervention to all parts of the globe within seconds or a maximum of a few hours. Therefore no member can continue to plead ignorance or helplessness with respect to the plight of our brothers and sisters on this planet. We are either victims or beneficiaries of our own actions. It is thus essential to accept that we are our brother's keepers and cannot sit idly by when he suffers. I am convinced that under your guidance  Mr. President  some if not all of the issues confronting our community will be fully aired and resolved."
"16",823,"BLR",42,1987,"The	delegation	of	the	Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic extends its cordial congratulations to you  Comrade Florin  on your election to the distinguished and responsible post of President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session and expresses the hope that  under your guidance  the Assembly will reach fruitful decisions conducive to peace  3-operation  and implementation of the lofty purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We are pleased to see the office of President of the Assembly held by a representative of a fraternal socialist State  a man who  weapons in hand  fought against fascism  in the territory of Byelorussia  inter alia.We also extend our greetings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who this year paid an official visit to the Byelorussian SSR. That visit demonstrated a common desire to enhance the role and effectiveness of the United Nations as an instrument of peace and international co-operation intended to work in the interests of all States and to lay down guarantees of global security with equality for all.Hopes and constructive efforts  skepticism and counteraction - those are the poles between which the needle of the barometer of political debate in this representative Hall has been oscillating for decades. Today  it is much closer to the point marking hope and positive prospects. Such a phenomenon has not been very frequent in the political climate in recent years. We welcome this favorable trend. There are sufficient grounds for it. International relations are beginning to move towards a qualitatively new dimension  one of constructive co-operation and broad and honest dialog.The Great October Socialist Revolution was a powerful generator of new  positive processes in international relations. In the course of the World War it was the first in history to raise the question of a just and democratic peace without annexations or war indemnities  as well as complete renunciation of any forms of aggression. This year marks the 7 0th anniversary of the Great October Revolution - the most outstanding event of the twentieth century  which has changed the world. There is probably no sphere of social relations that has not experienced its positive effects. The right of nations to self-determination  the equality of great and small nations  the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems  and the goal of general and complete disarmament - these and other progressive political categories were brought into being by the ideas of the great Lenin and the ideals of the October Revolution. The Lenin Decree of Peace brought peoples to the front of the stage of history. It was addressed not only to Governments but also direct to the peoples of the countries at war  something which  incidentally  incurred the acute displeasure of vested interests. These days we hear appeals from the rostrum of the United Nations to the hearts of people and nations and this  too  shows the impact of the October Revolution.The October Revolution made it possible for the people of Byelorussia to gain statehood  embark on a path of economic  social and intellectual progress in the interests of the working masses  and become a participant in international intercourse.Over the 70 years  which is historically a short time span  we have traveled a long roads from private property and the resultant exploitation of man by man  to free labor  which released the revolutionary creative energy of the working people? from national inequality to friendship and fraternal co-operation of people of different nationalities; from cottage industry to modern  multi-sectoral industry with highly advanced engineering  chemistry and electronics; from hunger to productive mechanized farming; from illiteracy to universal compulsory secondary education for young people  with numerous colleges and universities. It took tremendous effort and feats of arms to travel this path; for that reason we treasure its results all the more. It should not be forgotten that as a result of Hitler's aggression Byelorussia lost a quarter of its population and more than half of its national wealth.A direct extension of the cause of the October Revolution is the process of revolutionary renewal of all aspects of life  which is under way in our Republic and the other fraternal Republics of our country. Greater openness or qlasnost  more profound democratism  the new social and political atmosphere in our society  and the radical reform in economic management have re-galvanized the moral and creative potential of the working people and encouraged their initiative.We are witnessing stable improvements in living standards. The rates of growth of industrial and agricultural production in Byelorussia have now reached more than 6 per cent. Not too many countries can currently boast such a dynamic rate of economic development.Our people look forward to the future with optimism. We have set ourselves the goal of doubling our national income and industrial potential by the end of the century  with particular emphasis on improving care of the people and creating all the conditions necessary for a comprehensive and harmonious development of the individual.Peace is essential for the achievement of these lofty goals. The First All-Byelorussian Congress of the Soviets of Workers'  Peasants' and Red Army Deputies solemnly proclaimed in its appeal on behalf of millions of Byelorussian men and women the will to live in peace and friendship with all nations. The Byelorussian SSR has been invariably guided by that will in it's international activities  including here at the United Nations.Reliable peace can result only from persevering national efforts and the collective reason of all States. In the current strategic situation no single State  however powerful  can hope to have total security without assistance from others. Such assistance can  clearly  be given only on a mutual basis.Today the collective reason of States is starting to mature. As a result of the efforts of recent years the international community has now come to what appears to be a common realization that nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. This is a very important stage  which mankind has not reached easily. Any thought  however  should be crowned with action  with a logical conclusion sustained in practice. The conclusion of this important premise is that nuclear disarmament is essential. In this context  of special importance is the agreement in principle reached recently between the Soviet Union and the United States of America to conclude a treaty on shorter- and medium-range missiles  which brings us closer to the first step towards real nuclear disarmament. The Soviet-American agreement is the most serious argument against the view held until recently that only armament  not disarmament  brings about greater security.The significance of this step is not to be measured by absolute numbers of warheads to be eliminated or by their relative proportion in nuclear arsenals. It opens a door which  it has been proclaimed in the past in various political forums  is impossible to open.It is essential that the movement that has begun should continue its momentum so that the Reykjavik accord between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America to halve their strategic offensive arms be put into effect  while retaining and strengthening the anti-ballistic missile Treaty regime.with a subsequent move towards negotiations on further reductions. It is well known that the Soviet Union has declared that it is ready to relinquish  on a reciprocal basis  its status as a nuclear Power before the year 2000.There have been times in the history of mankind when a transition to the next phase of development required new materials for manufacturing tools as well as requiring new kinds and sources of energy. Those transitions ushered in a new age. Today mankind has reached a time when in order to make a transition to the next stage of civilization - indeed  to ensure the survival of the human species - it is necessary to embrace above all a new way of thinking  which will also usher in a new age.* an age of shaping a nuclear-free and non-violent world  a world without wars or arms  an age of molding a comprehensive system of international security.When a year ago a number of socialist countries  including the Byelorussian SSR  suggested for the consideration of the community of nations the possibility of establishing such a system  we did not offer any ready-made prescriptions. This initiative is intended for a broad dialog  for the participation and contribution of all. At this stage the multi-faceted exchange of views has begun to crystallize distinct aspects of the general outline. The article by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Parry of the Soviet Union  Comrade Mikhail S. Gorbachev  entitled ""Reality and safeguards for a secure world"" (A/42/574)  which was published at the beginning of this session  offers a basis for serious reflection on this subject  giving promising guidelines for joint work. The article has evoked a positive response among delegations. It is our hope that the current session will continue the process of shaping an agreed understanding of the mechanisms of such a system  a process comparable with the prescription of the great Michelangelo  who  increating a masterpiece of perfection  simply carved out of a piece of marble everything that was not needed. All the obsolete pieces should be discarded.The interdependence of today's world makes it necessary for us to start building our common safe house simultaneously from all its corners  taking into account the main areas of international relations. Like a.supporting structure  the component areas and units should be permeated with the idea of humanism and the humanization of international relations  for in the final analysis the building is being constructed for the human being. Much has been said here about human rights and the rights of peoples. On the whole  this is undoubtedly a correct perspective. It is incontestable that the foundation of our edifice would be extremely shaky if it were not based on a guarantee of the primary right - the right to life in conditions of peace and freedom. A defect of vision that prevented one from seeing this should be remedied.The retention and build up of armaments  above all weapons of mass destruction  are tantamount to a physical repudiation of the right to life  a kind of assertion of the anti-human right to take away life. Conversely  the fewer armaments the greater the chances of staying alive. The transition to a concept of ""reasonable sufficiency""  the complete elimination of nuclear armaments and other weapons of mass destruction while concurrently reducing conventional arms - this is what constitutes  from the standpoint of mankind's interests  the logical road to follow.""Security through excessive armament""  whether quantitative or qualitative  offensive or defensive  constitutes a logic of a different  anti-human dimension. In particular  space weapons lend themselves to juggling with the destinies of peoples from outer space or underground hardened bunkers  but not to ensuring safe skies above our heads.The words of Albert Einstein  a towering intellect in the nuclear age - ""You cannot simultaneously prepare for war and peace"" - are more than ever well founded. In the well-known Manifesto prepared together with Bertrand Russell  he stressed""... that we should learn to think in a new way  we should learn not to ask ourselves what moves should be taken to gain a military victory over the camp to which we do not belong - for there are no such moves - but rather we should ask ourselves what steps should be taken to prevent an armed struggle whose outcome is bound to be disastrous for all its participants"".In some areas the international community is already on the verge of taking arms-reduction and disarmament measures. We have already spoken about nuclear disarmament. What is needed now is merely to make several substantial additions.At an appropriate stage it is essential that all the nuclear States  withoutexception  join this process. What is more  the very essence of the emerging Soviet-United States agreement on medium-range and shorter-range nuclear missiles would be undermined if there were attempts to ""make up for it"" through a buildup of armaments  both nuclear in related categories and conventional.The goal of nuclear disarmament would be brought much closer if the nuclear States and their allies were to renounce the first use of nuclear and conventional arms and the use of force in international relations under any circumstances and in any conditions  as well as discontinue nuclear testing.In this context  we welcome the agreed draft declaration on enhancing the effectiveness of the principles of renouncing the threat or use of force in international relations  which has been submitted to the Assembly for its consideration  and the Soviet-United States agreement on establishing nuclear risk reduction centers and on commencing before this December full-scale  stage-by-stage negotiations on nuclear testing.The outline of a future convention banning chemical weapons is being fleshed out. The current phase of work is the result of extensive efforts  and this process must not be obstructed.The question of eliminating weapons of mass destruction cannot be closed unless measures are taken to prevent the development of new types of such weapons. The lamentable record of abuses of the fruits of scientific and technological progress does not allow us merely to brush off this issue. At the forty-second session the Byelorussian SSR will continue its efforts of many years in this area  with due regard to the positions of other countries.The important sphere of conventional armaments also requires new approaches.In our view  the main principle is simple  namely  that if there are any imbalances they should be corrected. It is essential that this be done through appropriatebalanced reductions  rather than through a buildup or ""supplementary armament"". impart from arms limitation and disarmament measures  in the direct meaning of this term  serious steps of a different nature can certainly be taken in the military and political areas. The Warsaw Treaty Organization has proposed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that their military doctrines be compared. The goal is to ensure their strictly defensive nature. Hie military doctrine of the Warsaw Treaty member States has as its objective the prevention of war  nuclear and conventional. They have declared that ""never and under no circumstances will they launch military actions against any State or alliance of States  unless they themselves become the target of an armed attack"". To be consistent  one could go even further  that is  to organize armed forces in such a way as to permit defense but rule out offensive operations.Confidence and openness in the military field should go hand in hand with disarmament. I note that quite recently the exercises in the Byelorussian military district were subjected to the first United States inspection  on request  in accordance with the 1986 Stockholm agreement. The request of the United States side was met without any delay and the inspectors were able to see for themselves that we comply fully with the obligations under the agreement. That is how  through concrete deeds  step-by-step businesslike and productive relations can and should be built. The process of joint negotiation of agreements and documents teaches us the difficult science of mutual understanding and teaches us also to regard the opposite side as a partner rather than an enemy.Speaking of the search for points of contact and common language on specific matters  Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev has said:""What is needed here is not only the faculty of speaking but also of listening. Not only of listening to but also of understanding one another  jointly searching for solutions to the most complex integrals of today's world.""In mathematics there is the notion of ""imaginary numbers"". It springs to mind while listening to some statements made from this rostrum since in many respects they appear to be based on imaginary concepts which  however  are offered to us as absolute. Thus  the term ""free world"" is enlarged to include several bloody dictatorships the notion of ""struggle for democracy"" is adapted to accommodate the maintenance of an army of cut-throats whose task is to overthrow the legitimate Government by committing violence against innocent civilians; and the phrase ""strict respect for the United Nations Charter"" is easily extended to the armed invasion of a small Caribbean nation  as well as to the all-round support of the aggressor which has seized land belonging to its neighbors.Surely one should not speak from this rostrum of freedom and at the same time deny in principle and deeds the right of peoples to self-determination and free choice of the means to bring about economic and social development.The efforts of the Contadora Group and the goodwill of the countries of Central America have initiated a very important positive process of putting a peaceful end to the conflict. Yesterday the General Assembly endorsed by consensus those efforts. All parties concerned should create the best possible conditions for its development and must not impede it. Only then will there be a genuinely humane interest meeting the needs of the peoples in the region  rather than selfish interests. In fact  this was mentioned this morning by the President of Nicaragua.Somewhat similar and equally positive processes have also got under way in some other conflict areas on our planet. The sprocket-wheels of national reconciliation mechanisms in Afghanistan and Kampuchea have started to move. These are all very difficult and very delicate processes. If we are to heed the voice of reason emanating from the very hearts of the peoples in these countries  what would be more correct - to encourage those processes or to encourage bandit groups to.It is also sufficiently clear that by joint and carefully considered efforts the community of nations can and must find a solution to the dangerous impasse in the Middle East  ensure human rights for the indigenous population of South Africa  ensure the independence of Namibia and all other Territories whose colonial status casts a dark shadow on the prestige of the end of the twentieth century  and find just solutions to the problems of Cyprus and Korea.What should be the ways of dealing with all these problems? We have repeatedly expressed our views on that  and we stand ready to search together for an answer in each and every particular case. The present situation in the Persian Gulf  however  shows what those ways should not be. The concentration of armaments instead of the concentration of goodwill leads only to the aggravation of the conflict and the escalation of the threat to the countries in the region and to universal security.Honesty and purity of intent are important not only in relations among human beings  but also in international politics. The prescriptions of Machiavelli  while they might have been deemed admissible in the distant past  hardly correspond to the notions of rules of conduct on the threshold of the third millennium. We should like the United Nations  this university teaching the science of how States can live together  to become also a school for the humanization of international relations.The transition to this new thinking will not be easy  but this has become an imperative of our age. It is time to abandon State egocentricism and to move towards understanding the primacy of interests common to mankind.Today it can be stated  with cautious optimism  that the elements of new approaches and realistic policies have taken root in the world community and are now sprouting. That is borne out by documents of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Palme Commission has been developing a concept of ""common security"". The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  stresses a new component:	""the	growing commonality factor in international affairs""(A/42/1  p. 2) . The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which took place before the opening of the current General Assembly session  emphasized in its Final Document that security comprises not only military but also political  economic  social  humanitarian  human-rights and ecological factors. The Conference noted the importance of a collective approach reflecting the needs of humanity as a whole. That unanimous conclusion drawn by a major conference has great significance and should become a universal guideline for practical action.Indeed  if the human being and his heart are our point of departure  then opportunities should be provided for material  financial and intellectual resources to be spent not for the preparation for war but for the improvement of the well-being of nations. One billion people in the developing countries live below the poverty line; 780 million suffer from malnutrition; 850 million cannot read or write; 1.5 billion have no access to medical services; and the same number are unemployed. Disarmament is an important and major source of ready resources for development  including that of developing countries.In the sphere of economic relations  the world community faces immense  complicated problems. It would be  to say the least  an over-simplification to regard private enterprise and the free play of market forces  advocated by some people  as a universal magic wand. Their magic is not the same for everybody. For some it is white  for others it is black. This magic does not produce only shining limousines - a Western symbol of wealth. An army of unemployed  the stone pillows of sidewalks for the homeless  the annual multi-billion outflow of resources from poor countries into the safes of the transnational corporations  the external-debt traps that is what provides the assembly line that turns out those limousines.To overcome underdevelopment  to solve problems of economic security  to establish a new international economic order  to remove everything that burdens world economic relations:	those	are	the	problems	that must be urgently solved.The United Nations is without a doubt the most suitable forum for finding mutually acceptable approaches to those problems on a truly universal and democratic basis  in the interests of all countries. We should like to see its role and effectiveness in this sphere increase in every possible way.The problems of the protection of the environment have been attracting increasing attention. We have no right to live at the expense of succeeding generations. Elementary decency demands that we turn our Earth over to them fit for life at the very least  and flourishing at best. Meanwhile  dangerous levels of pollution of the oceans  rivers  lakes and air  and desertification  lack of fresh water  the disappearance of entire species:	those	are not just warningbells; they are the tocsin sounding. For too long mankind has underestimated the scope of the problems  thinking that nature's potential is limitless. Experience has shown  however  that we cannot go on ""conquering"" it forever. It is time we learned to coexist peacefully with nature  since mankind is a part of it - the best  but also the most vulnerable.The global magnitude of the tasks facing us in this area makes necessary the broadest possible collective efforts in order to carry them out. It is essential to ponder joint projects to protect the environment against the consequences of economic activity and jointly to work out waste-free and clean technologies. The struggle for a flourishing Earth can become a testing ground to teach States how to act together for the sake of highly humane common objectives.Co-operation in preventing and treating dangerous diseases is also a promising and necessary area for work. In 1958 the Byelorussian SSR initiated the General Assembly decision for international promotion of research into the treatment of cancer. Unfortunately  the international situation at that time made it impossible to implement the decision consistently. It is even more important now  given the emerging awareness of the commonality of human objectives  to intensify joint efforts for health protection  in particular for combating a disease like AIDS.Humanism  in the broadest sense of that word  is  as has already been noted  the main support of the common building of security; it is the cement that permeates all the component spheres of international relations. The new thinking requires that a fresh look be taken at the socio-humanitarian sphere  which should be cleared of the pollutants brought about by the cold war  ideological biases and the purely confrontational approach; it calls for finding an effective framework for international co-operation and for focusing efforts on the universal recognition and observance of the rules of international law and inter-State relations worked out in the United Nations system.Speaking of the need for human contacts  we should also devote attention to the need for mutual understanding among peoples. To that end  it is essential to secure a flow of information that would bring peoples closer together  rather than antagonizing them  which would be objective and unbiased and which would be based on the image of the good neighbors  partner and friend  rather than the enemy.In regard to individual rights  family reunification  a visa regime  and so on  let us all agree to be guided by the international rules that have been worked out. In Bern  the countries that participated in the Helsinki process jointly worked out an important document on this subject  and it was only the position of one State that prevented it from being translated into a joint international standard for the protection of human rights. Even in those conditions  the Soviet Union declared that it would be guided by the letter and spirit of the document. Others should have followed its example. If one pursues the goal of consolidating human rights  rather than some other political goal  one should not obstruct the convening in Moscow of an appropriate forum  as proposed by the Soviet Union  but  rather  should come to that forum with a constructive position.There are many tasks to tackle  and the international community would be more than equal to them. The most important thing is to ensure that genuinely humane goals and ideals are not replaced by mere shams.The United Nations has very lofty ideals and objectives. It is essential that both its status and its authority be at an equally serious level. Regrettably  we must acknowledge that the outdated  selfish stereotypes of politics which are predicated on narrow interests and which have caused the utmost exacerbation of the international situation have also affected the prestige of the United Nations. But the incipient wave of new approaches and the new awareness of realities will inevitably raise it to the proper level. The Byelorussian SSR will contribute to that end in every possible way.Indeed  there is no international forum more appropriate for finding a joint solution to the principal problems that face mankind than the United Nations system  which is universal in two ways - the States of which it is composed and the range of problems with which it deals. It should therefore become a real center for harmonizing the actions of States to save the present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war  as envisaged in the Charter  it should be a platform for international law and order. The United Nations possesses powerful machinery for maintaining peace and security which can be used effectively only through the unified political will of States.The Security Council  its bodies  the Military Staff Committee  the negotiating mechanisms  in particular the Conference on Disarmament  the International Court of Justice  the specialized agencies and other institutions of the United Nations system can make our world much more secure and safe if they work at full capacity. In this process  the Secretary-General is called upon to play an increasingly important role. In addition  and in keeping with the challenge of our times  the United Nations can be charged with new functions  and new bodies may be established. The verification and monitoring of agreements which ensure security and disarmament  and the regulation of fruitful co-operation in a peaceful outer space are possible. Only one thing must be ruled out: attempts to influence undemocratically the course and activities of the United Nations. A financial blockade of United Nations activities is absolutely inadmissible.In the process of shaping a comprehensive system of international peace and security  and in actively contributing to all the stages of reducing military potentials  the United Nations - especially in a nuclear-free world - should become a regulator for maintaining the balance at a level of reasonable sufficiency  witha constant trend towards lowering it. In summing up  the following could be said of the future role of our common Organization; the United Nations must become a guarantor of comprehensive security.It has been said  quite correctly  that wars begin in the minds of men. What should be said now is that genuine peace begins with a new way of thinking. The future belongs to a new way of acting."
"17",858,"BLZ",42,1987,"﻿I wish at the outset to extend my personal congratulations  and those of the delegation of Belize to the President on his unanimous election to his high office at the forty-second session of this Assembly.We follow in the footsteps of a great diplomat and friend of Belize  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury of Bangladesh  to whom I express sincere appreciation for his untiring efforts to generate harmony among the representatives of the world during the forty-first session.A special word of thanks is also due Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our esteemed Secretary-General  whose guidance and statesmanship continue to sustain this Organization in its guest for peace in the world.Assailed by the criticisms of its detractors and beset by the woes of financial crises  the United Nations system nevertheless continues to articulate the vision of its founders and to provide a moral and practical framework for the ideal of an enlightened world order.The proliferation of new States and the awesome developments in the technologies of destruction have combined to make the management of international relations a far more complex business than the framers of the Charter could ever have imagined. The challenge for the United Nations system has been to keep pace with the requirements of the contemporary era and to become more than a political talking shop and more than a sprawling and soulless bureaucracy.It is one measure of its responsiveness to changing circumstances that the United Nations has latterly been examining its financial arrangements in order to make the Organization more viable and to quiet some of the voices of discontent. My delegation therefore applauds the new consensus mechanism agreed on by the budgetary committee. The arrangements represent a workable compromise which reflects the concerns of the larger contributors while preserving the all-important principle of equality of Member States. We can have no truck with the suggestion that small States should be United in the exercise of their sovereignty by some diminished status in the United Nations system. Such an idea is antediluvian and regressive in the extreme. The notion of sovereign equality and the principle of majority rule are the very foundations of the moral authority of the United Nations system. And the right of developing countries to use their numerical strength to influence the world view expressed by this forum is the essence of an attempt at global democracy.Nevertheless  it is a truism that every right carries a corresponding responsibility. Accordingly  the equality principle which informs the conceptual basis of our Organization must go hand in hand with the responsibility principle  which ought to underpin our decisions  resolutions and programmes of action.The surest way to erode a right is to abuse it. And it is the perceived abuse of the process of majority rule that has generated the fiercest criticisms of this Organization. If the nay-sayers are to be silenced  the force of numbers - particularly in the General Assembly - must be used in an equitable fashion. The temptation to engage in strident and automatic name-calling must also be resisted so as to preserve pristine the moral force of our pronouncements.Responsibility and restraint must once again form the basis of debate and resolution. Then there will be no room for the argument that those Western democracies whose views do not necessarily coincide with those of the third-world majority would do best to turn their backs on us. We will still be an imperfect institution in an uncertain world  but that admission should spur us all into a search for ways to increase the effectiveness of our Organization  not question its fundamental importance as the embodiment of International ideals.The United Nations does succeed in playing a moderating role in world affairs by making use of its global recognition and the public relations strength of its imprimatur or sanction. It is churlish not to concede that the United Nations has at least ensured that we do not return to the long-abandoned days of avowedly Darwinian international politics. As a small country  Belize understands too well the significance of a truly international forum whose collective authority is the ultimate guarantor of the sovereignty  integrity and dignity of small States everywhere.We do not expect the United Nations to provide all the answers or to substitute for those necessary bilateral arrangements which must still be concluded directly between developed and developing nations But we do expect the United Nations generally to advance the interests and ideals of the world community and to endorse  facilitate and aid those national and regional initiatives which sustain the international order.One such regional initiative that lends itself to United Nations approbation and support is the recently concluded Central American peace plan. That accord has emerged within the context of the Contadora initiative but is fashioned by the five States themselves involved in the Central American conflict. The plan has already advanced the peace process in Central America and has generally been hailed as providing the basis for a workable and just resolution to the region's problems.It seems to us in Belize that if the future of Central America were to be left entirely in the hands of Central Americans  the agreements reached at Esquipulas could provide a real blueprint for the pacification of the region. But there are  as always  the complicating realities of geopolitics. Indeed  external interests have already intervened to give an East-West dimension to a conflict whose origins are rooted in local conditions. In these circumstances  it is clear to my delegation that all of Latin America needs to speak out in support of what is proposed by the region to solve a conflict in the region. External forces acting on the basis of ideological opportunism should not be allowed to defeat indigenous political will. The process of democratisation in Central America must be worked out in site  and not according to some received wisdom stamped "" Made in the metropolis"".The initial promise of success of the Central American peace accord owes much to the determination of the leaders and peoples of the isthmus. That such a breakthrough could have occurred signals the possibilities for solutions to other hemispheric crises.Belizeans are profoundly concerned that national violence once again threatens to consume the independent Republic of Haiti. We understand the people's determination to participate fully in deciding the future direction of their country  and we are conscious that free and fair elections are the first step along the path to political stability  economic recovery and the reduction of social misery. We therefore urge the Government of Haiti to ensure that the already precarious transition to constitutional rule is not further imperilled.A return to democracy Is also imminent in the Caribbean nation of Suriname. Belize applauds that country's decision to allow international observers to be present at the elections set for November. We hope that the current difficulties can be overcome and the time-table set adhered to  so that political power can be handed back to the people as scheduled.Of interest to us also is the recent Initiative by Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines towards unification of the eastern Caribbean States. While full consultation with the people of those nations would be essential before any proposal for political union could be implemented  there are obvious advantages to be gained from unity.Better use of regional expertise  a larger market for domestic goods and more effective and less costly representation abroad are all sufficiently important that they should not be countered with automatic and unthinking assertions about the pre-eminence of political independence. In the case of my own Government  we have been encouraged to redouble our efforts to seek an honourable end to the long-standing problem with our neighbouring Central American State of Guatemala. After six years of uninterrupted enjoyment of independent nationhood Belize has forged its own international personality and established itself firmly among the nations of the world. There is no room in the contemplation of our continued existence for the encouragement of the pretension to all or part of our territory by another State.With the passage of time  with the universal acknowledgement of our independent reality and against the background of the democratic transformations emerging in our region  my Government feels that there is now a favourable climate for some degree of normalization to take place in relations between Belize and Guatemala.I say this despite the fact that the talks which took place in April of this year between the two countries failed to produce a breakthrough. Indeed  the Republic of Guatemala insisted on the cession o£ Belizean land as the price for a settlement. Comforted by the continuing support which enlightened nations of the world community give us  Belize totally rejected the Guatemalan position.Nevertheless  we have agreed to continue talking. Developments have taken place in Guatemala which incline us to feel that the April position was no more than a temporary hiccup in the negotiating process and that the formula can still be found for peaceful and active coexistence between neighbours.We look forward not only to a diplomatic accommodation with Guatemala but also to the economic co-operation that would surely follow. For the preservation and consolidation of political independence fulfil only part of the obligations of sovereign Governments. The guest for national dignity can succeed only when we satisfy the economic needs of our peoples: their need for food  clothing  shelter and jobs.For its part the young nation of Belize has already embarked upon the process of diversification from mono-crop preoccupations. An expanded and export-oriented economic base has been created  and we have widened our commercial relations while narrowing our trade gap. The production of bananas  citrus fruit and cacao has been increased. We have commenced an expansion in tourism  bearing in mind the need to preserve our plural culture and our ecological heritage. We have also continued the balanced exploitation of our forest resources and welcomed a new aquaculture industry  while trying to broaden our maritime fisheries.But even as we attempt to move ahead we come hard upon the realities of an inequitable international economic order. Markets for our products are unstable  commodity prices are low and protectionism has evolved from a device to a policy.Recognition of this situation points inevitably to the importance of multilateral co-operation in trade  money and finance and development. The need for strengthening the multilateral process as a means of ameliorating inequities in global economic relations becomes even more imperative when we consider the open advocacy on the part of some donor countries to tie bilateral aid to political conformity.Barriers to reciprocal trade need to be broken down  and the developed world must open its markets to the developing countries. Only with guaranteed access for their products and realistic terms of trade can small States hope to meet their obligations and establish growth.A new international economic order would also advance the cause of world peace  for it would remove many sources of national and international tension that have as their underlying causes inadequate responses to basic human needs. The spectre of the migration of millions of peoples from their native lands  be It in Africa  Asia or Latin America  crossing into neighbouring territories seeking refuge  strains the Imaginations and resources of the most well-intentioned. Most of our countries are already struggling with the intractable problem of distributing the limited resources available to our natural citizens. But  faced with the greater demands made on those resources by those whose only recourse for survival has been an exodus from their homes  the act of sharing can become almost unbearable.Conditions must be created to make it an exercisable option for refugees and others deprived of their heritage to return to the land of their birth and fashion their own destiny. Political and economic strategies must be devised to give back the future to those wandering masses.It is therefore pleasing to note that  for all the criticisms faced by the Organization  a large part of United Nations efforts has been directed towards the salvaging of countries from conditions of ignorance  deprivation and homelessness. Expenditures by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  the United Nations Development Programme; the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund have brought measurable advantages to peoples all over the world.When doubts are cast on the usefulness of this body  many States can point to the improved agricultural techniques' that have led to an increase in national productivity  to the programmes of education  immunization and sanitation that have improved the quality of life for their citizens and to the new skills and technologies that have enabled their policies to function and survive in the global village. Those are the tangible consequences of the United Nations system from which our constituencies benefit.Even as we applaud the results of United Nations developmental actions  we bemoan the inefficacy of some of its political pronouncements. In particular we are deeply troubled by the inability of United Nations resolutions to bring any real comfort to the millions of South African blacks suffering under the inhuman yoke of apartheid. The time has surely come for all Member States to agree on the measures necessary to exorcise a Pretoria regime that has forfeited any claim to civilized regard.We appeal particularly to those nations whose conceptions of real-politik have inclined them to treat as less than urgent the misery of the oppressed. We ask that they act now in helping to extirpate the abomination that is apartheid.Similarly  the independence of Namibia has been too long denied. Considerations of linkages cannot be allowed to stand in the way of Namibia' s freedom  self-determination and dignity.In the Middle East few would wish to contemplate the horrors that an expanded war in the Persian Gulf would entail. The Secretary-General's call for a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq must be heeded  and other interests would do well to reduce their military presence as one means of allowing United Nations diplomacy to take hold.Every effort must be made to encourage the process of dialogue in other Middle Eastern affairs. It continues to be our hope that an international peace conference will be able to reconcile the need for a Palestinian homeland with the right of Israel to exist within secure borders.The attention of the General Assembly shall remain focused on Afghanistan so long as the situation in that tragic country continues to create tensions that threaten international peace. Again  we call for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and for genuine attempts at national reconciliation.The power of self-determination must be conceded to the Afghan people so that the millions who fled their country may soon escape the misery and indignity of refugee life and return to their homeland.The essential ingredient of the solution to the problems in Kampuchea also involves the withdrawal of foreign troops. In accordance with United Nations resolutions we continue to call for a cease-fire and internationally supervised elections as the means to a comprehensive political settlement which allows the Kampuchean people their inalienable right to independence.The divided Korean peninsula must be reunited  and the process of reunification should take place through direct dialogue and negotiations between North and South Korea. It is imperative that the deeply rooted mistrust and hostilities between the two Koreas be replaced with the understanding and goodwill which are surely not beyond the capacity of a people whose culture is 5 000 years old.The fact of worldwide drug abuse and illicit trafficking is no less a danger to international order than the prospect of military confrontation and war. The Secretary-General has stressed the need for a concerted  comprehensive and truly worldwide effort to combat the plague of illegal drugs. My own Government has been nationally militant in the fight against narcotics abuse  and we have also joined in the international United Nations-sponsored efforts aimed at eradicating this menace. Earlier this year we hosted a conference designed to produce more effective strategies for regional co-operation. Perhaps the greatest threat facing mankind is the possibility of a nuclear Armageddon. Accordingly  we welcome the recent potential breakthrough in the struggle to curb the nuclear arms race. The agreement in principle concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union will for the first time eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons  and perhaps signals a new era of super-Power co-operation in the long journey towards total nuclear disarmament.The framers of our Chatter  were no unsophisticated people  nor was their vision one of utopian unreality. They conceived a system that combined lofty ideals with functional pragmatism. They devised a mechanism to mediate the competing claims of the just and the strong. They carved a moral landscape out of a barren prospect.Today  in a strife-ridden world  the United Nations system remains an assertion of our collective being  an affirmation of our humanity. We need to make the system work. We need to make it work or concede our civilization for ever to an encroaching jungle that promises only impenetrable shadows and darkness at noon."
"18",905,"BOL",42,1987,"﻿I should like to begin my statement at this world meeting by extending my congratulations to you. Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. The delegation of Bolivia respects your great personal qualities and experience and your worthy representation of a friendly country. I wish also to commend your predecessor Ambassador Choudhury of Bangladesh  for the distinction with which he presided over the last session.On behalf of the Government of Bolivia  I express gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his selfless and tireless efforts. His skill and perseverance in the search for solutions to the various problems facing the world are recognized by all. He is the champion of peace  understanding and brotherhood among peoples. For all these reasons  his re-election to his important post is a clear acknowledgement of the personal qualities of an illustrious Latin American.In this Assembly the people and the democratic Government of Bolivia reaffirm their faith in and unqualified commitment to the principles of the Charter and their conviction that it is only through dialogue and decisive political will and understanding among all the peoples of the world that we shall succeed in solving the problems that beset mankind  that our generation will be able to build peace and brotherhood and that the interdependence of all nations will be placed above hegemonism and sterile ideological disputes.We have noted with concern since the last session of the General Assembly that in many areas democratic dialogue among States has been replaced by violence/ and that force and the abuse of power have prevailed over reason  tolerance and the rule of law  with attempts to substitute themselves for negotiations in the solution of international conflicts. However  as we are all aware  force and aggression  apart from their illegality  have clearly demonstrated their inability to bring about or preserve peace.The United Nations has promoted the self-determination of peoples and the peaceful settlement of disputes  which are the very pillars of peaceful coexistence and principles that Bolivia has always respected and furthered.Peace is the very essence of the code of civilized norms of coexistence that must guide mankind on its historic journey within the framework of the profound sense of ethics that permeates the spirit of all human beings. One enormous obstacle to peace and the attainment of international security is the arms race  which is growing apace and has reached unimaginable levels. The arms race not only jeopardizes the precarious peace that we enjoy at present but is a key factor in the stagnation of the social and economic development of both the nations involved in that mindless race and the countries of the third world  since their efforts and resources would be better spent on raising the living standards of their peoples.Bolivia  as always  resolutely supports all disarmament initiatives designed to bring about peace and strengthen international security. I hereby declare Bolivia's readiness to seek the establishment of a zone of peace and security in the South Pacific. In keeping with those principles  my Government welcomed the announcement by the Governments of the Soviet Union and the United States of their agreement in principle to dismantle the weapons covered by the zero and double-zero options. This marks the beginning of a gradual process of nuclear disarmament  which must be maintained.In spite of the selfless peace efforts made by the United Nations  we continue to be alarmed by the conflicts in various parts of the world  which thwart the commendable humanitarian work of the Organization.In the context of eliminating one source of social conflict that is a blight on and a disgrace to mankind  Bolivia reiterates its utter repudiation of apartheid and all forms of discrimination  whether racial  religious  cultural  political  social or economic. Bolivia calls insistently for the self-determination of Namibia and the cessation of military aggression by South Africa against neighbouring sovereign States. Ideological pluralism  along with the self-determination of peoples  is the foundation of the coexistence of States. In this spirit  just as Bolivia recognizes the juridical and political existence of Israel/ so does it recognize the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to form a sovereign State in a free and clearly defined territory. We are certain that a solution to this problem will benefit the peace and security of the countries of the Middle East  and we therefore enthusiastically support the idea of an immediate multilateral conference  with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and the States involved  to reach a consensus on peaceful coexistence in a region so sorely tried by all the horrors of violence and blind hatred.Similarly  the search for an appropriate solution to the problem of the two Koreas can only benefit that part of the world. We appeal most fervently to the parties concerned to engage in negotiations inspired by a spirit of reconciliation and brotherhood. Tragic and fierce conflicts in Asia and Africa  particularly the Iran-Iraq war  the constant deterioration of the situation in Lebanon  the military occupation of Cyprus - all persist in spite of the pleas of the international community. Bolivia  in its traditional spirit of peace  appeals earnestly to the Governments and the leaders of the parties concerned to take constructive decisions and make meaningful efforts to reach solutions to these conflicts. We emphatically urge implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which was adopted unanimously.The persistence of those inhuman situations distresses the Bolivian people  because we see with heavy hearts that similar tensions are now arising in Latin America and the Caribbean.Happily  the prolonged Central American crisis is entering upon a process of change  thanks to the commendable initiative of the Heads of State of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua  who  with the firm support of their peoples  held a meeting of Heads of State of Central America last August under the auspices of the Government of Guatemala. This meeting contributed in raising our hopes for the achievement of diplomatic solutions  hopes which we had voiced even before the efforts of the Contadora and Support Groups began.Accordingly  we are exceedingly gratified to learn that the five Heads of State decided to unite their efforts and strive as one to bring about an early understanding in favour of peace in Central America. This endeavour must be complemented by the international community  which should make an exceptionally generous contribution to the economic reconstruction of these sister countries.In spite of this commendable progress  there is a conflict which endures and is a source of concern to Latin America: the vestige of an outdated colonialism that affects the legitimate sovereignty of a sister nation  the Argentine Republic  in respect of its territorial rights over the Malvinas Islands. It is imperative  that the parties concerned re-open negotiations with a view to bringing about a just and peaceful solution to the problem; thus Bolivia supports General Assembly resolution 41/11  which declares the South Atlantic to be a zone of peace and co-operation.Bolivia's support for the rights of the sister Republic of Panama over the Canal is unwavering  and proceeds from our spirit of pan-American ism. The Torrijos-Carter Treaty is an example of this spirit  and its unqualified implementation is an imperative for the Latin American and Caribbean community.The world economic situation is of grave concern to my country. There is the threat of a major recession whose repercussions would be felt mainly in the developing countries. It would have disastrous consequences for primary-commodity producers and exporters like Bolivia. We view with amazement the unfair granting of subsidies  intolerable trade discrimination and reactionary protectionism. Those regressive factors impede economic exchanges between nations and cause irreparable harm  in particular to the developing countries which have imposed on them economic restrictions that strangle free international trade. Such a chain of reactionary nationalism leads to the existence of an unjust international economic order.We now have a global economic system which  even in times of apparent peace  bears the signs of controversy. In this sense  there is a radical lack of symmetry  owing to the fact that some alliances within the system do not answer to any control or regulation machinery and because of their scope  strength and power exert a de facto influence over the entire system. Nevertheless my Government hopes that the decisions adopted by the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will be carried out. We should like to take this opportunity to extend sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General of UNCTAD  Mr. Kenneth Dadzie  who has worked so hard and effectively to promote international trade.Bolivia wholeheartedly supports the Caracas and Buenos Aires Programmes of Action  which establish economic and technical co-operation among developing countries  in this context I should like to mention the recent agreements of fraternal co-operation between Paraguay and Bolivia  and between Peru and Bolivia  respectively  which we trust will in the very near future greatly benefit our nations.The Uruguayan Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has given new hope to the developing countries. We believe that the item on natural resources deserves special consideration within that framework.My country  in keeping with its new economic policy and its plan for reinvigorating domestic production  and having followed with interest the latest actions of GATT  has applied for membership in that body.External debt  to which we have referred so frequently both here and elsewhere  because of its ill-effects on the economies and the growth of debtor countries  is fraught with political and social dangers from which there is no escape. We view with profound concern that the so-called periodic adjustments do not contribute to finding a solution to this structural problem. They lead to a drain of financial resources from the debtor countries to those States having predominant financial centres that has reached the astronomical figure of some $200 billion annually. This amounts to a plundering of the poor peoples of the world. The United Nations could become the appropriate forum for dealing with this complex problem  given the co-operation of all the countries concerned  both debtors and creditors  in a multilateral effort with positive effects for all States and public and private financial systems that have already tried various alternatives without achieving an adequate definitive solution. This is a concrete issue that requires the immediate consideration of the Organization.Permit me now briefly to speak on some particularly important aspects of the situation in my country. About two years ago Bolivia embarked on a new economic policy and a new style of development. At the same time  we began to put into practice the principles of authority  responsibility and morality within the democratic framework of the life of my country  so as to make of economic democracy a factor for social justice. In August 1985 the Government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro took over a country in the grip of runaway inflation at an estimated cumulative rate  for December of that year  of 40 000 per cent  accompanied by a 20 per cent drop in its gross national product - all that against the backdrop of a grave political and social disarray. It needed great political courage by the President and his Government to apply the necessary ""shock"" treatment in order to halt the runaway inflation by establishing control over finances  instituting tax reform and introducing a single  flexible and realistic exchange rate  as well as uniform tariffs. These efforts were positive but short-lived. The attempt was frustrated in October 1985 by a blow to our foreign trade caused by a fall in the prices of primary commodities  minerals  particularly tin  and fuels.Bolivia is facing a historic challenge. In order to preserve its democratic system we are pursuing a drastic anti-inflationary policy and there have been positive results. With financial stability  both internal and external  the annual rate of inflation has been kept below 10 per cent and the exchange rate reflects supply and demand. The amount of tax collected has risen from 1 per cent to 9 per cent of the gross national product and the budgetary deficit has been eliminated. Reserves have risen by over 100 per cent and we have established social discipline and full legal and constitutional order.It should be recognized that an adverse effect of the success of our policy of stabilization has been a drop in real incomes and employment  problems which we are trying to remedy by re-stimulating production in the short term and by economic and social development over the medium and long terms.Moreover  our Government  in spite of serious economic and financial restraints  has not neglected the social area. In the belief that democracy can flourish only in conditions of social well-being  it has established an emergency social fund designed to provide temporary work projects for the unemployed. Similarly  we have established an emergency economic recovery fund and a national social policy council  as well as a national council for co-operatives and a public housing institute. We fully support the consolidation of social property and integral and participative co-operativism.Pursuant to its effective stabilization programme  Bolivia has signed with the International Monetary Fund a stand-by agreement and a structural adjustment agreement  with expanded facilities over three years  thus becoming the second country to secure such an agreement  which enables it to obtain compensatory financing.With regard to its external debt Bolivia has arranged with the ""Paris Club"" to reschedule its bilateral public debt and is now enjoying the co-operation of the members. Preparations are now under way for a new round of negotiations.In brief  Bolivia is now economically and financially ripe for investment and international co-operation and that  together with its natural resources  justifies expectations of healthy political and social development. We would like to pay a tribute to the work of the United Nations Development Programme as a source of multilateral technical co-operation and pre-investment. Its activities help to expand economic co-operation among developing countries.On this occasion I should like to say on behalf of our Government that we are emerging from the most serious hyperinflation in Latin American history and the seventh most acute hyperinflation to have struck any country anywhere. The people of Bolivia wish to resolve these problems within the framework of democracy and freedom and that calls for a great spirit of sacrifice and solidarity in order to avoid falling into the trap of totalitarianism which  unfortunately  in similar situations has been the corollary of transition in such fragile circumstances.My Government  conscious of the magnitude of the problem of drug trafficking  has recently  in this very forum  condemned that criminal activity and taken the initiative  along with other Governments of the region  of calling on the United Nations to proclaim drug trafficking a crime against humanity and to convene a world conference to examine the problem  a conference which would recommend concerted action to combat it at the international level. In pursuit of the same policy  Bolivia took an active part in the preparations for and work of the Conference held last June in Vienna on drug abuse and illicit trafficking. That Conference was a landmark and a testimony to the unanimity of purpose of our peoples and Governments. Its results will benefit future generations. The documents unanimously adopted there constitute a valuable basis for harmonizing the legislation of the different countries  and that will make more effective humanity's fight against this criminal and perverse activity.Bolivia has also concluded an agreement with the United States of America for the eradication and replacement of the coca plant  with a precise timetable for both the voluntary and the forcible elimination of the crop as well as punitive action against the crime and rehabilitation of the offenders. This step taken by the Government of Bolivia is a clear expression of its determination to fight this scourge of universal dimensions  in spite of the political  social and economic problems involved in carrying out these plans for countries which bear the misnomer of producers.However  it is an inconceivable paradox that action such as that just mentioned  which has been launched from the highest political level in Bolivia  should not be fully understood by certain agencies of the United States Government  which still show biased and short-sighted understanding of so vast a problem. Bolivian democracy  which is slowly emerging  has just had imposed on it  by the unilateral action of the Government of the United States of America  a ""sanction""  which only encourages drug trafficking  since the budget cuts recently decided upon seriously weaken the national will to banish from out territory this terrible transnational of organized crime. Whether with or without the economic co-operation of the United States of America  Bolivia will not cease its efforts to eradicate the trafficking in drugs. Once again we must emphasize the solid emergence of multilateralism in the fight against drugs. The spirit of the Conference in Vienna and the dynamic action of courage and efficiency of the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control are the only firm hope that States have of restoring the honour of their peoples  the health of their youth and the efficient co-operation to build a common united front to put an end to this nefarious crime without political manoeuvring.These steps have been accompanied by the implementation of domestic policies designed to combat drug trafficking. On 25 July last we created the National Council against the Abuse of and Illicit Traffic in Drugs  charged with the task of formulating and establishing the policies of development/ crime prevention and rehabilitation within our overall plan for crop substitution and for development. My Government wishes to reiterate before this Assembly its determination to continue its unrelenting fight against drug trafficking  in compliance with the Declaration and the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Plan of Future Activities adopted in Vienna.On numerous occasions the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and worship of Bolivia have made reference to the maritime problem facing my country  a problem which for over a century has seriously affected its economic and social growth. I feel I should now briefly refer to that matter  which is one of the issues of conflict which afflict Latin America. Since the Ninth General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS)  in 1979  the hemisphere's regional organ has insistently recommended and exhorted Bolivia and Chile to find a peaceful  just solution to Bolivia's landlocked situation. This has been embodied in a variety of resolutions adopted by the organization's General Assembly in Washington in 1980  Saint Lucia in 1981  Washington in 1982 and 1983  Brasilia in 1984  Cartagena de Indias in 1985 and Guatemala in 1986. The substantive part of that OAS resolution states·. ""The General Assembly ""In a spirit of fraternity and with a view to the integration of the Americas ""Declares that it is of continuing hemispheric interest that an equitable solution be found whereby Bolivia will obtain appropriate sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean  and ""Considering that it is necessary to achieve the foregoing objective and to consolidate a stable peace that will promote the economic and social progress of the area of the Americas directly affected by the consequences of the landlocked status of Bolivia  and Resolvesi""1. To recommend to the States most directly concerned with this problem that they open negotiations for the purpose of providing Bolivia with a free and sovereign territorial connection with the Pacific Ocean. These negotiations shall take into account the rights and interests of the parties involved  and might consider  among other things  the inclusion of a port area for integrated multinational development  as well as the Bolivian proposal that no territorial compensation be included."" As a consequence of this continental concern and Bolivia's unbending determination to recover its access to the Pacific Ocean  in 1986 Bolivia took the initiative of arranging a new process of negotiations with the Government of Chile with the sole objective of achieving its access to the Pacific and proposing adequate compensation  to our mutual benefit. After a series of informal consultations between the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Bolivia and Chile  there was an official meeting between the Ministers representing their respective states on 21-23 April 1987 in Montevideo  thanks to the generous hospitality of the Government of Uruguay. There and then the Bolivian Minister gave his Chilean counterpart a proposal  on the basis of which the negotiations began. At that meeting the Bolivian delegation replied to various questions posed by the Chilean delegation  confident that a formal round of diplomatic negotiations had been initiated and that it was obviously being carried out seriously and in good faith by the two countries.A few days later the atmosphere of favourable expectancy created by a policy of mutual friendliness and accommodation was disrupted by an abrupt and rude declaration by a member of the Chilean naval forces  whose statements certainly did no credit to his uniform. Those comments were both incoherent and aggressive  thus bringing to a halt the course of negotiations aimed at finding a solution to the strained relations between the two brother countries.On 9 June 1987 the Bolivian representative in Santiago was abruptly summoned to the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs  where he was handed an official communiqué containing a rude rejection of the Bolivian proposal  thus unilaterally breaking off the negotiating process.At the same time the Government of Chile launched a well-planned publicity campaign aimed at convincing the Chilean people and the international public thatBolivia had never had access to the Pacific Ocean. A flood of fallacious and erroneous historical ""facts"" were thus used in an attempt to distort and invalidate Bolivia's historical  moral and political right to its own coast and a port area on the Pacific.Bolivia has repeatedly submitted the irrefutable documented proof on which it bases its historical right to its own outlet to the Pacific Ocean  which was impetuously seized by Chile in a war of aggression in 1879 - an attack brutally and unexpectedly unleashed not only against my country but also against Peru. I do not wish to burden representatives with the details of that documentation. I shall refer only to the most categorical admission by Chile to the effect that the Bolivian littoral was taken by force during the 1879 war. That admission is contained in an official dispatch sent by the Chilean representative Mr. Abraham König to the Bolivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 13 August 1900. The relevant parts read;""... Chile has occupied the littoral and has taken possession of it in the same way as Germany annexed Alsace and Lorraine to its empire ... Our title is born of victory  the supreme law of nations ... that the littoral is rich and worth millions  we knew. We keep it because we value it if we did not value it  we would not be interested in keeping it.""That official declaration has never been disavowed by Chile  nor has it been argued that Mr. König  the author  was not authorized to make it. The terms of Konig's note were the basis of the Treaty imposed by Chile in 1904.From the memorandum presented by Bolivia during the Ninth General Assembly of the Organization of American States I shall extract only a few brief points pertaining to the economic impediments from which Bolivia has been suffering as a consequence of the Chilean occupation so brilliantly described by the Chilean diplomat König. The territory in question has an area of 158 000 square kilometres  an area larger than the state of Pennsylvania  with a coastline of more than 400 kilometres·  it includes four ports and seven coves. The copper exported by Chile since 1979  amounting to more than 20 million tons  came from this region. That is the equivalent of the reserves of the entire Asian continent plus the reserves of the Soviet Union. Chile has thus become the world's primary exporter and the second-ranking producer of copper  after the United States- In addition  other natural resources  such as guano  saltpetre  sulphur and so on  are still being extracted from that area.The basic acknowledgement of the serious juridical  moral and material damage inflicted on Bolivia and the concept that this problem is both detrimental and dangerous to the harmony and social development of the region have prompted the repeated appeals of the OAS for a peaceful  negotiated settlement of this situation. That is why Chile's infamous  inexplicable refusal is so offensive not only to Bolivia but also to the Organization of American States  which seeks to foster Bolivian-Chilean understanding.We are only too familiar with Chile's arguments: ""Chile owes nothing to Bolivia""  ""There is a Treaty in force between the two States""  and so on. These are all feeble arguments designed to paper over a reality which is charged with conflict. We do not seek to denounce or ignore existing treaties  even if they did arise out of military defeat. We are asking the international community to help us to find  through negotiations in good faith  an agreement that will be a contribution to the peace  integration and development of the area  which requires realistic  imaginative and long-lasting solutions that will promote the common well-being of both our nations.To conclude what I have to say on this matter  I reaffirm the determination of the Government and people of Bolivia to press their claim in the Organization of American States  to which we owe our gratitude for the sense of justice and equity it has shown in supporting Bolivia's search  through serious bilateral diplomatic negotiations conducted in good faith  for a peaceful solution to its maritime Problem. At the same time the Government and people of Bolivia wish here in the General Assembly  the supreme forum of world opinion  to voice their protest over an unjust situation.The international community has reiterated here its support for efforts made in the context of multilateralism  an instrument of modern international law and practice  which seeks to build and guarantee a civilized way of life of benefit to all the peoples on earth.However  some Member States appear to be vacillating over honouring their commitments. Delay in the payment of contributions  as a means of exerting pressure and not because of economic difficulties  represents a serious threat to the United Nations. I therefore reiterate the Bolivian Government's full support for the United Nations system  including all its agencies and bodies. On this basis  Bolivia will continue to co-operate in the further democratisation of the United Nations bodies and will insist on just and equitable geographic representation  free from any vestiges of feudalism.Another threat to the normal functioning of the United Nations system is the disregard for commitments made with regard to it.The public conduct of Governments comes under the spotlight when it harms or violates positive multilateral laws of which States are the substantive beneficiaries  as in the recent case of an unspeakable incident provoked by the Government of Chile  when it gave offence to a high official of the Bolivian State. In a politically and ideologically motivated repressive action  the Government of Chile in whose territory the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) has its seat  denied the Bolivian Vice-Minister of Social Defence and head of the Bolivian delegation an entry visa he required to participate in the first Latin American meeting of heads of national drug law enforcement agencies  which is being held this week at the ECLAC headquarters That reactionary police action  which fully reveals the morality of that Government  characterized by ostentatious display of power  was an attempt to prevent the participation of a Bolivian representative in a multilateral meeting - a representative who has always been involved in the struggle for democracy and social justice. I thank the office of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Executive Secretary of ECLAC for successfully demanding that the Government of Chile meet its international obligations by granting the visa.Because of that incident  together with many other acts that  have interfered with ECLAC's work since September 1973  Bolivia will take steps within the competent United Nations bodies to have the Commission's headquarters moved. The issues on the agenda of this memorable session deal with problems of concern to all mankind. We should try not to discuss modalities  points of view or interpretations of crises and their diverse forms but to concentrate on real substance; the question of freedom or irrational force. We must be prepared to identify the opponents of freedom  with the aim of uniting the majority of nations to preserve and strengthen it- For that  it is essential to give priority to spiritual values  which in some tragic circumstances ate ignored or treated as being of secondary importance.Perfecting the social order consists in combining force and the law. However it is essential that force be directed by the law otherwise  at dramatic moments in the life of States unilateral arguments are advanced  authoritarian power is exercised and fratricidal violence occurs  reducing to mere chimeras the universal laws and morals of peace and interdependence.This year's session of the General Assembly coincides with the anniversaries of two events which  both instructively and controversially  have contributed to the development of human society. I refer to the 200th anniversary of the legal adoption of the Constitution of the United States  a document whose ideas have borne much fruit elsewhere in the political development of the world  particularly among those of us whose public institutions are rooted in democracy/ freedom of the individual and the independence of States. This year also marks the 70th anniversary of the Russian revolution  a historic milestone indispensable to an understanding of the social changes of the 20th century which have led to the overcoming of those excessive individualistic injustices that obstructed the integral development of the economic expectations of our societies.The lessons of both those events/ and both approaches to supporting the development of the human being  together with other products of the human spirit aimed at reconciliation  must converge towards a synthesis of peace  freedom and economic justice and love and understanding between individuals and nations. In that way the 21st century will combine the light of individual freedom with social security and international justice  to turn the planet into one world/ where the State and the free marketplace of ideas  services and goods will once and for all put an end to violence  tyranny and the dogmatism of the ideologies of hatred/ and where love and peace will prevail among all God's creatures  including all humanity."
"19",952,"BRA",42,1987,"﻿ It is with a renewed feeling of confidence in the United Nations and a keen perception of its vital role in the strengthening of peace and co-operation amongst peoples that for the third time I come to this podium.Nearly all the nations of the world are represented here  protagonists in the universal and egalitarian communion that this General Assembly propitiates every year. Here the nations  large and small  raise free and sovereign voices in a discussion of important items on the international agenda.Brazil has the privilege of opening this debate  which allows me to be the first to compliment you. Sir  upon your election to the presidency of this General Assembly and to convey to you our best wishes for your complete success in that capacity. I would like also to express my appreciation to Mr. Choudhury  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  for the able way in which he presided over the work of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. I bear responsibility for carrying out the foreign policy of a Brazil reborn into the practice of democracy  strengthened in its commitment to the interests and aspirations of its people and open to candid dialogue at the international level.I speak on behalf of a country which is absolutely loyal to its diplomatic traditions  one that is building its future with determination  without being intimidated by the obstacles raised by the reality of the modern world. This reality  unfortunately  is independent of the will and aspirations of most of the peoples of the world and is not always in tune with the lofty purposes of this Organization.The so-called crisis of multilateralism undermines the attempt at juridical regulation of international life and saps the foundations of co-operation among States.The world will no longer tolerate structures based on the supremacy of the few and the submission of the many. Attempts to impose oligarchic schemes on the organization of international society meet with increasing discredit. There is no place any more for rigid and exclusive formulas  Manichean dualisms  or theories that arbitrarily divide up world power - theories often inspired by geometrical figures. The world will come upon better days only when the international order is made effectively democratic and  to achieve that goal  the United Nations has an essential role to play.No nation or group of nations has the right to impose its own conceptions and solutions on the increasingly complex picture of international relations. No one nation should seek to isolate itself or fail to take into consideration the universal aspirations of the community of nations.I view with satisfaction the fact that the two super-Powers - by means of direct dialogue between their leaders. President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev - are seeking more fertile understanding and mutual confidence which  we trust  will result to the benefit of all countries. Along the same optimistic lines  it should also be recorded here that there was a recent important meeting between the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic - Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Erich Honaker - an historic event that may well lead to positive developments for a mature and constructive relationship.In multilateral diplomacy there ate perceptible signs of encouraging vitality. One of those signs was the decision to create a zone of peace and co-operation in the South Atlantic - a decision of undeniable significance for the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of this Organization. There is still hope for a peaceful settlement of the conflict that for over a decade now has been raging in Central America.The United Nations represents the awareness of mankind that only by dialogue and persuasion can differences between States be resolved amicably. In unanimously adopting its resolution 598 (1987) on the conflict between Iran and Iraq  the Security Council showed its capacity to act in a constructive way to arrive at the peaceful and negotiated settlement of disputes. This action to restore peace  in accordance with the terms of the Charter  leads us to believe that in other cases it will be possible to have recourse to the authority of the Security Council  in the same conciliatory spirit. I am persuaded that the Council's diplomatic potential should be used to the fullest extent.It was in the light of this conviction that Brazil decided to present its candidature for one of the seats allocated to Latin America on the Security  Council. Brazil believes that it is in a position to make a constructive contribution during the coming biennium in reactivating the Council's role and in settling problems that affect or can affect international peace and security.Having been honoured with the unanimous endorsement of the Latin American Group  we hope to be equally worthy of a vote of confidence from this General Assembly.The latest signs of a break in the clouds that darken the international political situation are in direct contrast to the indefinitely prolonged economic crisis. The magnitude of the challenges facing the developing nations and the total lack of progress in restructuring the international economic order are the two sides of the coin of the same deeply disturbing panorama.There is no raising of consciousness about the drama and concerns of the nations of the third world and their right to a destiny of achievement and progress which is under constant threat. I am from a developing country that will never surrender this right and is not only convinced of the justice and legitimacy of its claims but also of the viability of its objectives in the economic and social fields.An additional cause for concern in the international community is the persistence of political crises that have been aggravated by the resort to force in violation of the United Nations Charter. Only last year I remarked to this Assembly that  where force is present nowadays  stalemates are more frequent than either victories or defeats. The use of force or the threat of the use of force is not only illegal but is proving itself to be ineffective as well. This holds true in the Gulf region  where the machinery of violence is out of control. It is also true in southern Africa  with the persistence of the tense climate provoked by the apartheid regime  the unjustifiable delay in bringing about the independence of Namibia and the acts of hostility and aggression perpetrated by South Africa against its neighbours. Only the intolerance  short-sightedness and unreasonableness of the racist policies of South Africa can explain the continuing existence of this situation  which is an offence against human dignity and violates the principles governing relations between States.On the other hand  it is becoming more and more urgent to give new impetus to attempts to achieve a lasting  comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East. Brazil believes that the need to convene an international peace conference  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all interested parties  is becoming increasingly pressing. In this context  I reiterate our concern over the suffering inflicted upon the people of Lebanon  a country whose integrity should be respected.We are hopeful that understandings arrived at between the parties involved  with the participation of the United Nations  will quickly lead to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and the cessation of all forms of outside interference  so that the Afghan people may exercise their sovereign right to self-determination.We also view with concern the continuing impasse in the case of the Malvinas. Brazil  which recognizes the sovereign rights of Argentina  hopes that the parties involved will heed the appeal repeatedly addressed to them by the General Assembly to attempt to reach through dialogue a negotiated settlement of all aspects of the dispute. I am pleased to note that the proposals on the subject of the South Atlantic made from this rostrum in 1985 by Mr. Jose Sarney  the President of my country  were successfully made a reality in the initiative culminating in the General Assembly's approval of resolution 41/11  of 27 October 1986. The establishment of a zone of peace and co-operation of the South Atlantic signified the international community's recognition of the determination of the South American and African countries of the region to maintain their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and to promote co-operation for economic and social development in conditions of peace and freedom.For that decision to be implemented properly  other States must co-operate in good faith. This is indispensable. The militarily more significant States are called upon in particular scrupulously to respect the peaceful statute governing the region  and to avoid extending into the region rivalries and conflicts that are foreign to it. I cannot fail to point out that serious focuses of tension continue to exist there and that they are detrimental to the full realization of the objectives and principles of the decision adopted by the General Assembly.From the rostrum of this peace forum I wish also to register the satisfaction with which Brazil views the possibility of the conclusion in the near future of the first agreement in history on nuclear disarmament. If  as we all wish  the United States and the Soviet Union come to a successful understanding on medium-range atomic weapons  we shall have the first real disarmament measure  in contrast with previous agreements  which amounted to nothing more than a palliative management of the arms race.It is obvious that the more heavily armed countries bear the primary responsibility for the disarmament process. But it is equally indisputable that other States have the right to participate in the decision-making process on problems that  although caused by some  affect all  without exception. We therefore consider it indispensable for the negotiations between the super-Powers to be linked with the efforts made in multilateral disarmament forums  especially the Conference on Disarmament  which Is entrusted with a specific mandate.I stressed in my statement at the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  the developing world has been plunged into a deep crisis  and the efforts we are making to resume economic growth are confronted with an adverse International reality  with structures that accentuate the differences instead of reducing them. I also affirmed then that the attempt to shape the new by using the models of the past impeded the resumption of growth and development on a world-wide basis and the formation of a more just and more equitable international system.The understanding arrived at on the problem of the foreign debt  as set forth in General Assembly resolution 41/202  is an indication of the promising headway which has been made  progress which should now be consolidated. I repeat here the firm and clear position of my country; we acknowledge our International financial. We will settle our foreign debt under fair and reasonable terms and conditions. No one can claim that Brazil has not Itself made every effort to overcome its difficulties. Brazil cannot  however  jeopardize its development.In their efforts to seize Increased economic opportunities  the developing countries encounter the severest restrictions imposed by their industrialized 	fields of finance  trade in goods and services  and  especially  the absorption of state-of-the-art technologies. This is a tendency that undermines the heroic struggles of developing countries to assure their peoples a dignified and prosperous future. It is a tendency that dashes those nations' expectations of more just and equitable participation in the international economy - and more than their expectations: their irrefutable right.Brazil has no alternative but to grow. We must meet the crucial needs of a vast population which  in many strata  has known nothing but poverty and suffering. Development is not an option for us; it is an imperative. The efforts undertaken by the developing countries to create a new international economic order will produce results only if they are accompanied by effective action to offset the distortions that exist in the policy of transfer of scientific and technological knowledge. In this regard a vigorous endeavour can be noted on the part of some developed countries to seek to create a new international division of labour  but a division that would be more inequitable and prejudicial to our interests since it would thwart our legitimate right to have access to the latest scientific advances and mastery of state-of-the-art technologies. As President Sarney stated on 4 September  when he announced Brazil's mastery of the technology for enriching uranium  Brazil cannot forgo broad and unrestricted access to the entire range of available scientific knowledge and its practical applications.In this connection I wish to reiterate my country's commitment to use nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. This commitment not only is beyond dispute but also is supported by the positive effects which Brazil's technological advances in this field  together with those of its sister nations  are producing  to the enhancement of increased co-operation and mutual trust in Latin America. The initiatives of collaboration which are being implemented between Brazil and Argentina In particular  will assure the  mastering of the nuclear cycle without the development of atomic weapons in our continent. This common purpose was highlighted in the exchange of correspondence between Presidents Jose Sarney and Raul Alfonsin when the announcement of Brazil's mastery of the technology for enriching uranium was made public.The fact that Latin America is showing its ability to find practical and creative answers to its own problems is most encouraging. In this regard I should like to cite the example of the dynamic action which the Contadora Group has been 'taking  with the political backing of the Support Group of which Brazil is a member  in its quest for a genuinely Latin American solution to the conflict in Central America.On behalf of my Government I wish to praise the important understandings arrived at on 7 August last in Guatemala. On that occasion the Heads of State of the five Central American nations gave a clear and historic demonstration of political will to resolve the conflict. Brazil deems the accord signed then to be one which offers a unique opportunity to guarantee peace in the region. To that end it has lent its active and interested contribution to the understandings which resulted in the decision  adopted on 22 August in Caracas  to set up an international commission for the purposes of verification and surveillance.In Brazil's judgement the results of the recent steps taken in the quest for a peaceful solution to the Central American crisis indicate that the countries of the region are themselves in a position to find ways to put an end to the conflict which concerns and affects all of Latin America. To accomplish this it is essential that all other countries with ties or interests in the region avoid displaying any attitude that might render such solutions non-viable. The same ability of Latin America to find its own solutions to the problems of the continent is corroborated by the creation of the Permanent Mechanism for Consultation and Political Co-ordination  instituted as a result of the fruitful experience acquired over more than two years of successive contacts among the eight countries which make up the Contadora and Support Groups.The decision of those countries  arrived at last month in the city of Sao Paulo  to begin to hold periodic meetings at the presidential level is an indication that the process of regional co-ordination begun in Rio de Janeiro has rapidly matured. In fact the Group of Bight is an integral part of a process of broader regional understanding  another of whose multiple facets is to be found in the renewed efforts towards the integration of Latin America  which Brazil  as well as other countries of the region  has been fostering in various forums such as the Latin American Association for Integration  the Latin American Economic System  the Latin American Energy Organization and the Cartagena Consensus.I wish to reaffirm before this world forum the importance my country attributes to the agreements for integration and economic co-operation concluded with Argentina and Uruguay at the beginning of last year. These are instruments of truly historical significance which attest to our fraternal determination to grow together  to strengthen our democratic institutions and to contribute to the success of the greater undertaking  which is today closer to realization than it was yesterday: the Integration of Latin America as a whole.My words here today have expressed greater optimism and hope than I voiced in this forum last year. This attitude can be explained in the light of some positive aspects of the current International panorama. Along with this optimism and hope  however  I cannot disguise my disappointment and even indignation at the imbalances and inequities which persist on the international economic scene· Recent progress in the political field is not being accompanied by advances in the struggle against misery and poverty. On the contrary  the insensitivity and unyielding attitude of the developed countries are increasingly evident on issues of trade  finance and the transfer of technology My country is currently experiencing a time of crucial importance for the definition of its political and institutional directions. We are about to approve a new constitution within the framework of perfecting our democratic way of life. Brazil is ready to continue along the road to peace and construction. This is the road that will lead to progress and prosperity for our people  in growing harmony and closer co-operation with all friendly nations."
"20",996,"BRB",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the people and the Government of Barbados I offer you sincerest congratulations. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session.We also wish to commend your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury of the Republic of Bangladesh  for his deft and elegant execution of the presidency at the forty-first session. His approach and his success are timely reminders that the effectiveness of this Organization resides not in the size of the material store of its Member States but rather in the quality and capabilities of their citizens.We must express our appreciation to you  Mr. Secretary-General  for your steadfast stewardship in remaining at your post to steer the United Nations through this period of unprecedented financial and political peril. Yours is not an easy job  but we have every confidence in your commitment to the integrity of multilateralism and to the survival of the United Nations.Permit me to take this opportunity to pay a brief tribute to a statesman who in the normal course of events would have been standing here today. The late Errol Barrow was a man who had limitless faith in the purpose of this Organization and a clear recognition of its importance for small States. Errol Barrow's was the gift of a comprehensive grasp of history  from which evolved a remarkable foresight. Within five years of his assuming control of government  the foundation of Barbados1 independence had been laid. His was a vision nurtured in but not confined to the politics of Barbados. He spent his political life promoting and exhorting others in the Caribbean to pursue the goals of self-reliance and political non-alignment# which he regarded as pre-eminent in a world wracked by ideological conflicts.His charge to Barbadians that they be ""friends of all  satellites of none"" underscored a conviction that modern history had given to the new and emerging States of the world a specific role in international relations. Let me express the deep gratitude of all Barbadians for the universal sympathy extended to us on Prime Minister Barrow1 s passing.On 1 July this year  I addressed the plenary session or the Caribbean Community Heads of Government meeting in Castries  St. Lucia  and took the opportunity to articulate the principles on which Barbados' foreign policy would be predicated They are simply these: recognition of the right to equality of all States in the international community and  in particular  the right of small States to conduct their relations without being bullied or harassed by richer and more powerful States; the preservation and protection of national independence  national sovereignty and national security; the pursuit  protection and development of national resources and national economic interests; resistance to the penetration of our culture and way of life by alien ideologies which do not respect fundamental rights  moral values the rule of law and a greater measure of equality in social and economic life collaboration with countries in the region and beyond  in working for peace and justice and for a new social  political and economic order and repudiation of all forms of racism  apartheid  colonialism  hegemonism  tutelage and imperialism.Having declared these principles  I should like to examine a few questions often raised about the politics of small island States. Why should a tiny island like Barbados  with few resources  enjoy national sovereignty? Can such a small State  having gained its independence  contribute anything to the international community? Will such a small State become a burden to the large and powerful States?My answer to the first question is both brief and self-evident. Barbados  a mini-State  sought to achieve national sovereignty because  for Barbadians  national sovereignty is the most natural condition of a people's existence. We hold that it is not independence and national sovereignty that need justification. Rather  it is the condition of dependence and suggestion - whether it be colonialism  imperialism  hegemonism or any of the several modern ""isms"" used to describe a system in which the conditions of existence of one people hinge on those of another.Therefore  when we assert that no one can manage our own affairs better than we can  we are doing more than voicing an opinion: we are stating a philosophical principle - that freedom to determine their own destiny is the birthright of all people.On 30 November 1987 Barbados will celebrate the twenty-first anniversary of the attainment of sovereign independence. Our experience during those 21 years has confirmed that what Barbadians believed in principle has proved in practice to be effective. With few resources and a capacity for hard work we have been able to transform what was a poor  one-crop economy into a thriving centre of diversified economic activity that affords our people a vastly improved standard of living.We have created a political system of social democracy in which the talents and enterprise of individuals are allowed free play and in which people are assured of health care  education  housing and working conditions as basic rights not subject to market-place negotiation. Moreover  that system is Institutionalised within a legal framework that guarantees the rights and freedoms of all citizens.But national sovereignty must signify more than the right to manage one's domestic affairs· The exercise of national sovereignty must encompass the right  the capacity and the will to manage one's relations with other nation States  free from all forms of external coercion  inhibition and interference· I am therefore distressed to note that many small States represented in this Organization have frequently found themselves the target of ill-conceived and lightly considered criticism ever since their emergence from colonialism·This leads me to my second question  Can a small State contribute anything of value to the international community? The answer to that question is equally obvious to Barbadians  for we contend that small States can and do make valuable contributions to the international community. Indeed  the international community as we perceive it today owes its very survival to the small States of this world.Large and powerful States often succumb to the illusion that they can forgo multilateral diplomacy that they can dispense with international co-operation  that they can rely on ""balance of power""  ""spheres of influence"" and ""alliances"" to protect and promote their national Interests abroad.Small States  on the other hand  cannot court self-delusion. They must be active participants in the international community. They must be steadfast practitioners of international co-operation. They must be vigorous exponents of multilateral diplomacy and firm supporters of international organizations.Small States  therefore  have a significant responsibility in this regard. And it is precisely because we are aware of that responsibility that the Government of Barbados rededicates itself to working assiduously for the continued evolution of an international system of multinational diplomacy for peace  development and the security of human rights. For peace cannot be the brokered result of power. While this might have been possible in a pre-democratic age  in today's enlightened world a peace that does not satisfy people's demand for freedom  justice and development will hardly be lasting.In Barbados we see a logical connection between disarmament and peace. We believe that if resources now devoted to destruction were deployed to meet the teal needs of our people many of the causes of conflict and the guest for weaponry would not arise. In this connection  we should like to record our commendation of the efforts of the super-Powers to reach an arms limitation agreement. However  we concur in the dictum of the Brandt Commission that arms limitation arrangements cannot replace disarmament.Barbados is a vigorous exponent of true and genuine non-alignment and a faithful adherent of that movement and its principles. We believe that the prospects for peace may be enhanced if small States refrain from engaging in conflicts whose origins are often alien to the interests of their peoples or their national priorities. We believe that  such prospects would be fortified if major States devoted their influence and capabilities to assisting small States in finding productive avenues for national development. We are convinced that such assistance would substantially reduce those tensions which propel small States into local and fratricidal conflicts which devastate their vital human and material potential·Accordingly  Barbados was quick to welcome the signing two months ago of a plan designed to bring peace to Central America· This Organization and all peace-loving nations must commend highly the five Central American Presidents who were involved in that initiative. Barbados especially commends the Government of Costa Rica for spearheading this latest development in search of harmony in the region - a process nurtured by the painstaking diplomacy of the Contadora and Support Groups of countries.It is our wish that similar approaches could prevail in the Middle East  the Korean peninsula  Kampuchea  Afghanistan and elsewhere. Barbados believes that the concept of development has many components; economic advancement  the attainment of greater human dignity  security  justice and equality. Strategies for development may differ among States  but it is widely agreed that  without appropriate regard for the interdependence which links all States  no strategy  however well-devised  will have much scope for success.Some small States see multinational co-operation  quite correctly in my view  as the most important means of preserving and enhancing their sovereignty: that is  preserving sovereignty from excessive dependence on powerful bilateral partners and enhancing it by allowing small States to achieve collectively what individually lies beyond their resources  It is for this reason that small States must foster the establishment  growth and continued stability of all forms of multilateral partnership and co-operation. We in the Caribbean have drawn clear lessons from our efforts at functional integration under the umbrella of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Now in its thirteenth year  this regional body has given the Caribbean people an efficient mechanism for the expression of their highly developed sense of regional unity and identity and for the attainment of common economic and political goals.Barbados has derived similar satisfaction from its membership of the organization of American States  in which our wider loyalties as a hemispheric people are encouraged and strengthened. We welcome the opportunity offered us by the amendment to the Cartagena Protocol to demonstrate further our commitment to sovereignty and solidarity in the region. The past 21 years have brought with them significant economic transformation in Barbados. We take pride in this achievement  but we are mindful of the fact that our performance might have been far different had it not been for the support and co-operation developed through the United Nations system.Barbados remains committed to working for the implementation of both North-South and South-South international co-operation. The biggest impediment  in this regard  however  remains the global debt crisis in which the third world is entrapped. We are persuaded that the solution of this crisis may be found in commitment to partnership between developed and developing countries. The long-term solution to the debt problem  as I see it  will require a new orientation to the concept of international trade  bearing in mind that small countries  and especially small States  are heavily dependent on an orderly and fair system of international trade for their economic stability. The Barbados Government will continue to make every effort  both at the regional and at the global levels  to co-operate with other States to ensure that such a system prevails. At stake lies the very survival of our people.Our efforts will be no less unstinting in the general area of human rights. Barbados stands among States that pledge themselves to the promotion of all human  civil and political rights and freedoms  among them the right to personal property and protection from slavery and enforced labour? Freedom of expression  assembly and association; and freedom of movement and protection from discrimination on the grounds of race  place of origin  political opinion  colour  creed or sex  subject to respect for the rights and freedoms of others and the public interest. We also pledge ourselves  within the limits of our resources  to promote the economic rights of citizens which enhance the quality of life for individuals and families.The year 1987 carries yet another symbol for the people of Barbados· The social and political foundations of what we may regard as modern Barbados were established by certain events which occurred some 50 years ago  in July 1937.Barbados was one of several countries in the Caribbean whose inhabitants confronted in the 1930s a declining colonial regime whose modes of governance were not sufficiently responsive to the interests and aspirations of the Caribbean masses. The masses revolted. It is against this historical background that the people of Barbados repudiate the violations of human rights that continue to besmirch our world. We are aware that there are those who ask: Why does the Government  or indeed the General Assembly of the United Nations itself/ make such a fuss about apartheid in South Africa when violations of human rights are committed elsewhere in the world without attracting quite the same attention? The answer is simple: We condemn apartheid and its perpetrators because it is a systematized  institutionalised and governmentally sanctioned abomination  and just as the United Nations was formed out of the tumult and bloody conflict of the Second World War to ensure that such an abomination may not be repeated  so too the United Nations must have as its highest priority the elimination of apartheid.We believe that apartheid owes its survival in part to the weakening of international commitment to clear concepts of the rights of mankind. We have wavered when we ought to have been forthright. Too often have the issues of human rights been viewed through the screen of ideological concern. Too often have they been subordinated to perceived national interests.I have sought to indicate some of the principles which underpin the foreign policy of the Government of Barbados. We are a small nation  but our size has in no way impinged upon our capacity to differentiate between human rights and human wrongs.As we in Barbados prepare to mark our coming of age as a member of this body  we look forward to even greater participation in its several councils and agencies. And as I conclude  I wish to suggest that greater participation by small States in the management of the Organization will not be an achievement for small States only  it will be  above all  an accomplishment for the United Nations. It is only when such participation becomes commonplace that the United Nations will have reached its own maturity and the promise of San Francisco will have been fulfilled. We in Barbados look forward to continuing the excellent relations we have enjoyed with the United Nations. We pledge ourselves to continue to uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter. We affirm our belief that men and institutions are free only when freedom is founded upon respect for the rule of law and respect for moral and spiritual values. We declare our intention to assist in maintaining a society and an international community in which all persons and nations  great and small  may make their just contribution to the welfare of all mankind. "
"21",1028,"BRN",42,1987,"﻿It is a pleasure for me to congratulate you. Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. I note and appreciate that your country was one of the many countries that spoke to welcome Brunei Darussalam when it was admitted to the Organization in 1984. I am confident that with your wisdom and experience you will be able to guide this session to a successful conclusion. Our congratulations go also to your predecessor  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  on his excellent work as President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session.To the Secretary-General my delegation would like to express its appreciation for his unceasing efforts  patience and devotion - qualities which are an example to us all.Twelve months have passed since the last session of the General assembly.There has been no improvement in the world situation  although a few events in the past year have given us some ray of hope for the future - hope for a better world  а more peaceful world.The General Assembly declared 1986 the International Year of Peace. That near has ended with no sign of the conflict of the 1980s diminishing. For example  the senseless and appallingly bloody war between Iran and Iraq continues unabated. It is a source of great concern to their neighbours  and the escalating attacks by both sides on shipping in the Gulf can have very grave political consequences. It must now be apparent to both parties that this conflict can be resolved only by negotiation. Brunei Darussalam therefore welcomes Security Council resolution 598 (1987) . We also call upon both sides to co-operate with the Secretary-General and assist him by complying with the Council's call for an immediate cease-fire.When discussing the political situation in the Middle East  we need to consider the wider issue of the Arab-Israel conflict. The main problem of this conflict remains the Palestine question. My delegation feels that an international conference  which has been proposed  would be useful in bringing all parties concerned to the negotiating table. However  the stand taken by some parties  notably Israel  has prevented any progress towards the convening of such a conference. In our view  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and it should therefore be at the conference to negotiate on their behalf.In the African continent  the immediate problem is still the apartheid policy of South Africa. Numerous debates and resolutions adopted by the Assembly condemning this unjust and evil policy have been ignored by South Africa. My delegation is convinced that more concrete and effective actions must be taken. Pressure must be exerted on the Pretoria regime to change its policy  and it is the moral obligation of the international community to see that this policy is dismantled. Brunei Darussalam also denounced South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia. We call on South Africa to withdraw its troops from Namibia so that free elections can be conducted to determine the Territory's future.In Afghanistan  the Afghan people are still being denied their inalienable rights. Foreign forces are still occupying their land  driving them from their homes to live as refugees in Iran and Pakistan. We urge the immediate implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the withdrawal of foreign troops. We fully support the Secretary-General's efforts to resolve this conflict.In our own region of South-East Asia  the problem of Kampuchea is still with us. The Vietnamese forces of occupation are now in their ninth year in Kampuchea. Meanwhile  the resistance fighters of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  under the leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk  continue their fight to free their land from foreign occupation. The overwhelming support given by the international community has strengthened their determination to continue their struggle and they have already made significant progress  not only in regaining their territory but also in winning the hearts and minds of the people.Peace in South-East Asia can be achieved only if the Kampuchean problem is resolved. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has put forward many proposals  the latest or which is the convening of a ""cocktail party"". It is our hope that this will encourage a process of dialogue that can open the way to negotiations on a solution to the problem of Kampuchea. Viet Nam  however  has chosen to reject that proposal. Viet Nam should realize that this problem can be resolved only by peaceful means. We urge Viet Nam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea and work out a peace settlement within the framework of the eight-point proposal put forward by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.Turning to the situation in the Korean peninsula  my delegation welcomes the recent statement and initiatives of the Republic of Korea proposing a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We believe that this will lead to а lessening of tension and further enhance the prospect of peace and stability in South-East Asia. We also wish to reiterate our support for the admission of the Republic of Korea as a Member of the United Nations  if it so desires  in conformity with the principle of universality of the United Nations.I have highlighted some of the problems that confront us. There are many others. The most important of these  which continues to dominate the international political scene  is the question of the elimination of nuclear weapons. The world would be a better and safer place in which to live if those in possession of these highly dangerous weapons could agree to their elimination. There are already enough destructive weapons in this world without nuclear weapons. Brunei Darussalam therefore welcomes the agreement in principle on the elimination of medium-range nuclear weapons between the United States of America and the Soviet Union.It is the role of the United Nations to promote international peace and security. Let us give the United Nations a chance to succeed. Let us all express our political commitment to the United Nations by continuing to give it the financial support it needs to maintain its operations and by honouring the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly. If we have the will and determination to create a peaceful world  I am sure that we shall be successful. The price of failure is too great for all of us. "
"22",1071,"BTN",42,1987,"﻿I have the honour to convey to all representatives the warm greetings and best wishes of my august sovereign. His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  for the success of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.I should like to extend my sincere felicitations to you/ Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. We are indeed fortunate to have a statesman of your great experience and ability to guide our deliberations. I should also like to congratulate Ambassador Joseph Reed on his appointment as the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs. Mr. Huraayun Rasheed Choudhury  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  deserves our highest praise for the truly outstanding manner in which he conducted the proceedings of our last session and for the valuable contribution he made to the work of the Assembly. A tribute is also due to our Secretary-General for the dedication with which he is carrying out his onerous responsibilities.In his annual report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General made the following comment on the current international situation:""Countries of disparate political orientations and economic systems have begun to deal with problems of an interdependent world with a new pragmatism in awareness of the dangers of immobility. ... It is as if the sails of the small boat in which all the people of the earth are gathered had caught again  in the midst of a perilous sea  a light but favourable wind."" (A/42/1  p. 2) The favourable wind of which the Secretary-General spoke has in no case been more dramatically demonstrated this year than in the agreement  in principle/ between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America to dismantle the intermediate nuclear forces. The significance of that agreement does not lie in the number or class of weapons it will eliminate. Its true significance has been explained by Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in the following eloquent words;""For the first time in history the idea of nuclear disarmament is close to the beginning of its fulfilment. It is not a new idea. What is new is that this turns out to be possible. Only yesterday all we could see was a blank wall; today we can see far ahead.Two thousand warheads are but a small part of nuclear arsenals  but that is a big enough part for its disappearance to give the world a new vision. The agreement on these weapons is only the lesser part of what has happened. Something much more important has taken place: the Soviet Union and the United States have finally spoken together the first word in a nuclear-free vocabulary. When that word becomes deed  the world will also gain new knowledge. It will become convinced that nuclear weapons and security are not synonymous and that security becomes stronger when those weapons disappear."" (A/42/PV.9  p. 2)The delegation of Bhutan fully subscribes to those lofty sentiments  which give renewed hope to humanity. We are convinced that the two super-Powers  imbued with purpose and vision  have embarked on an undertaking of heroic proportions  an undertaking which seeks to ensure the very survival of the human race.We wish Secretary of State Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze every success in their talks in Moscow later this month and we hope that the summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev later in the fall will become a real turning point in the history of east-west relations and will herald the beginning of the process of eliminating all strategic nuclear weapons as well as other disarmament measures. The world will then become an infinitely safer place in which to live and the two leaders  through their contribution to the disarmament process  would have carved out for themselves honoured niches in the history of mankind.It is to be hoped that the wisdom that has dawned on the super-Powers will also cast its benign rays on the other nuclear Powers of the world and that they will exercise self-restraint and control in the testing and development of new nuclear weapons and in accretion to their existing stockpiles. It is also hoped that other countries that have developed the capability of producing nuclear weapons  particularly developing countries  will desist from taking the path of economic and strategic disaster. Diversion of massive amounts of scarce resources to unproductive ends at the cost of the economic well-being of nations  cannot be justified in any circumstances. The greatest fear under which all the peoples of the world live today is the threat of a nuclear holocaust. We must all endeavour to rid ourselves of this spectre.The majority of States on this planet ate small  while their locations and circumstances may vary greatly  they are by their very nature weak and vulnerable. Internally  their transition to modernity is creating a whole range of disturbing imbalances. Externally  they face a sombre economic  political and strategic environment compounded by erosion in the spirit of multilateralism. Because of their limited resources  they are severely handicapped in pursuing their development goals. Yet  in spite of those handicaps  it is quite heartening to note that an increasing number of small States are playing significant roles in international affairs. All of us in the third world are committed to the creation of a new and just world order in which all States  large and small  can enhance their well-being and security and make a contribution to international peace and progress.We subscribe to the view that internal cohesion  economic self-reliance  a prudent and well-thought-out foreign policy based on geo-political considerations  and a distinctive national identity based on a nation's culture and traditional values  are important elements in ensuring the well-being and security of a small State. The assumption that the main threat to a nation's security comes from other countries has not only led to a disastrous world-wide arms race  but has diverted attention from the real causes of a State's instability and insecurity; namely  internal social  cultural  economic and political factors. In fact  the arms race by ruining the economies of developing and developed countries alike  has led to a deterioration of the international politico-strategic environment. While Bhutan attaches the highest priority to nuclear disarmament  we should like to appeal for a halt in the conventional weapons race which consumes the bulk of global military expenditure and which fuels all regional conflicts."
"23",1111,"BWA",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  your great country  the German Democratic Republic  and your region of Eastern Europe  have done the international community great honour in making available to it the services of such an outstanding internationalist as you are. We are confident that your stewardship will be rewarded with Important achievements for our Organization. As a member of the General Committee  my delegation will give you its unstinting support as you carry out your tasks. I also congratulate my namesake  Mr  Joseph Reed  on the new career upon which he has now entered.What can we say about your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury. It was his tireless efforts and patient negotiating skills that brought about bold compromises on the difficult question of restructuring the United Nations system  a process that we hope is genuinely aimed at revitalizing the delivery system of the United Nations rather than at crippling the Organization. The Assembly will miss his authoritative gavel but it can take comfort in the fact that his successor is a man of no less sound diplomatic skill and experience.Our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  continues to be a true successor of the great men of letters and impeccable credentials who have come to our Organization to serve their fellow men. His annual reports are invaluable tools in our work. We must heed his advice on what needs to be done to deal with the intractable problems confronting us. My delegation salutes him and his staff at the end of another year of their dedicated service on behalf of us all.As the year 1987 draws to a close  there is mounting evidence that the international economic situation will not be much different from that of last year. The overall environment still presents blurred images and conflicting visions. Most economic observers agree that growth  even in the industrialized countries  remains sluggish and volatile.For the developing countries  this means that the spectre of woes that has haunted their economies in recent years  is still present. But for Africa  which in solidarity with the international community adopted the African Priority Programme for Economic Recovery (1986-1990) in this Assembly last year  the situation is particularly serious. The unity of purpose demonstrated at that historic session has not been vindicated. Although Africa has demonstrably tried to initiate the reforms called for by the Programme  the international economic environment has  on the other hand  deteriorated sharply since last year  making nonsense of some of the reforms we have undertaken.The economically ravaged continent has enjoyed no relief. Prices of primary commodities from which African countries derive most of their foreign exchange remain terribly depressed  the debt burden has become unbearable  interests rates are still sky-high  exchange rates of major currencies have remained volatile  while protectionist tendencies are rearing their ugly heads and multilateral official development assistance has been reduced. Add to this litany of economic woes persistent natural calamities ranging from drought  desertification and cyclones to crop pests and the population explosion  as well as man-made ones  such as civil wars and destabilization: and one has a continent on the verge of economic collapse.The World Bank estimates that during 1986 the economies of developing countries grew by only 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product. This was hardly enough to cope with the population growth rate  which is around 3.5 per cent in a number of these countries. African economies grew by only 1.2 per cent in 1986. The prospects for this year are such that for developing countries the overall growth would hardly average between 3 and 4 per cent of gross domestic product. Out of these figures  the Economic Commission for Africa (EGA) estimates that the African region will experience a growth rate of between 2 and 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product.The Commission has been quick to point out  however  that even these figures may have to be revised downwards  given the fact that in a number of African countries the output of cereal and agricultural products is threatened by new dangers. In spite of the good rains that have fallen in some parts of Africa  locusts and grasshoppers are threatening crop harvests in East and southern Africa  the Sahel and some parts of West Africa. In southern Africa  it is already clear that cereal harvests have not been good this year  owing partly to these pests and also to persistent drought and destabilization - destabilization caused by another pestilence  namely that of apartheid. The fact is that Africa has done its very best to implement the Priority Programme. Painful structural reforms have been initiated in a bold attempt to rehabilitate and revitalize the economies of the continent in response to the Programme and the urgings of the international community. There is more than enough evidence of that a fact to which ECA can attest  and what is lacking is a decisive response on the part of the international community. While we sincerely appreciate and welcome concrete pledges made at the special session  some of which we know will be made good  it is our studied conclusion  nevertheless  that the international community at large has remained generally indifferent to our plight. And this does not help the reforms upon which we have embarked.We are somewhat disappointed also that the recent seventh special session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held in Geneva has not met our expectations. The problems of resource flows  money and finance  commodities  international trade  and the least developed countries were basically hedged and thus left without any fundamental and permanent solutions. It is out hope that more follow-up efforts will be put forth to continue to seek meaningful and durable solutions to these problems.Similarly  we welcome the continuation of the Uruguay Round talks in the belief that they will find solutions to the problems of tariffs and non-tariff barriers which restrict free trade in the world to the detriment of third world countries. We  in Africa  are determined to play our role in the difficult search for solutions to these problems both in terms of developing strategies of self-reliance and in terms of playing the role of co-operating partners with other countries  especially the developed countries. It was in this spirit that an international conference on the challenge of Economic Recovery and Long-term Development in Africa was held in Abuja  Nigeria  in June this year  and an African Symposium on Grassroots Development was held in Niamey  Niger  during the same month. Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity have also called for an extraordinary session on the debt problem in the not-too-distant future.My delegation also welcomes the setting up of an advisory group by the Secretary-General to look at the question of African resource flows. We hope the report of this eminent group will be considered seriously by those in a position to assist.The political agenda of the session is familiar. It is almost the same agenda we have seen year after year  session after session in the past several decades. In our part of the world  in that troubled region of Southern Africa  the deadly menace of apartheid remains a source of great anxiety to the people of the region. The situation there is worse that it was when we met here last year. The country-wide state of emergency  through which the South African authorities had hoped to shield their strife-torn country against the eyes of the world and thus give free reign to the brutalities of apartheid  remains in force  but it has not given the country the peace it so desperately needs  nor has it made apartheid any less despicable and evil  or the pressure for change any less imperative. South Africa remains a violently racist and polarized country  despite the deafening rhetoric about reforms in Pretoria and Cape Town. Despite all the urgings of the international community for change — and dramatic change - black townships are still under military occupation and detentions without trial of anti-apartheid activists - trade unionists  members of the clergy  students and even children - continue unabated. Even leaders of the United Democratic Front  who have taken such pains to follow the rules of peaceful agitation for change  are either in hiding or in prison. Indeed  no organization or institution in South Africa which seeks to identify itself peacefully with the struggle for change has been spared. Universities have become the latest candidates for emasculation and/or pacification. This may come as a surprise but talking peace and change in South Africa has become a dangerous undertaking. I must repeat  talking peace and change in South Africa has become a dangerous undertaking  if not a crime  for those who are not part of the same government which does not want peace and change on terms acceptable to the totality of the people of South Africa. The visit to Senegal a few months ago by a group of white South Africans who have accepted the wisdom of talking peace with the real leaders of black South Africans has become an act of treachery in the jaundiced view of the rulers of South Africa. Those who engage in such extra-parliamentary but peaceful activities have been threatened with dire consequences.My country remains adamant in its conviction that if there is a way out of the quagmire of apartheid - and we believe there is for the rulers of South Africa - it is the way of peaceful negotiation  the kind of negotiation which the Commonwealth mission of peace that went to South Africa last year had tried to encourage  without success. We know what happened to that mission. It is not the kind of negotiation envisaged by the so-called National Council on which ""black moderates"" are to be invited to serve while the African National Congress of South Africa (AWC) and those other leaders of black South Africa who are considered radical are to be included only on condition that they renounce violence.We ask: how can a government that employs so much violence - a government which has killed so many children  so many old people  men and women - simply to enforce apartheid demand renunciation of violence on the part of apartheid's victims  the very same people it kills with impunity? As the Commonwealth negotiating concept envisaged  violence is to be suspended  not renounced  on both sides to enable the initiation of negotiations. This remains the best way to proceed with negotiations  and the onus is on the Pretoria regime to prove that its lavish rhetoric on negotiations is not one of those transparent ploys it often resorts to mask continuing intransigence on its part.The necessary conditions have to prevail for meaningful negotiations to have a chance of success. First  the white community  or its leaders  must accept as a fundamental and inescapable point of departure  the principle that nothing short of the creation of a truly democratic political order in a united non-racial South Africa will bring peace to that country. Nothing short of that would bring peace to that country. And an important corollary to that is the release from prison of the very leaders - Mandela and others - whose absence from amongst their people will not allow any negotiations to begin. Also necessary and crucial as prerequisites for a successful launching of genuine and meaningful negotiations ate; the lifting of the state of emergency; the removal of troops from black townships; and the un banning of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and other political organizations whose unfettered participation in the creation of a new democratic constitutional order in South Africa is indispensable. Anything less is a waste of time. Just as we have said  and we say now  the so-called reforms are a waste of time - a waste of time and a vindication of our contention that all these reforms are designed to modernize the tyranny of apartheid  to make it acceptable or bearable to its victims  if that were possible.It is nearly 10 years - and this is another scandal - since the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978) as a blueprint for peaceful decolonization  of Namibia. That the resolution remains a dead letter to date speaks uncharitably of the United Nations. Where is the Security Council which drafted resolution 435 (1978)? Where are the Western Powers  the so-called contact group that worked so hard nine years ago to have that resolution adopted by the Security Council? Why the silence  the inaction now?The failure to implement this important resolution cannot be explained away in any credible way  for the simple fact is that the Security Council has allowed itself to be enfeebled by the arrogance of a small Power  with the result that its own plan - its own blueprint - is likely to die an unnatural death. The United Nations Charter contains all the powers the Security Council needs to have its resolution 435 (1978) implemented. The Security Council must demand - and demand with conviction and with a determined sense of purpose and not with equivocation - that South Africa co-operate in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) or face the consequences. In other words  the demand for implementation of that resolution calls for the same toughness and determination with which the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (197b) on the Iran-.Iraq conflict is being pursued. We want to hear all the permanent members of the Security Council in unison  as we saw them the other day on television  threaten dire consequences if Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is not implemented. That is what they have been doing with regard to implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) . But we do not see the difference between the two conflicts - the conflict in southern Africa threatens peace; the conflict in the Gulf threatens peace. Hence we do not see why people should spend sleepless nights and restless days trying to implement resolution 598 (1987)   and when we ask them to implement resolution 435 (1978) they resort to the veto. We cannot understand that.So we call for a redemption of honour on the part of the United Nations: the United Nations must redeem its honour. The people of Namibia must not be forced to continue to die needlessly in a war whose termination was decreed by the Security Council nearly 10 years ago through the adoption of resolution 435 (1978) . The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) is ready  and has always been ready  to begin implementation. The Secretary-General has been itching for action. The front-line States are ready to be as helpful as they can in the implementation of the resolution.Too much is at stake in our region. Thousands of lives are being lost in wars whose root cause is the situation in South Africa - in other words  apartheid. Like the sword of Damocles the apartheid military machine hangs over our heads. The majority-ruled States of the region have been reduced to war zones where bandit gangs in the employ of the Pretoria regime  complemented occasionally by its commando incursions  sow death and destruction. Massacres such as those that have been occurring with increasing frequency in the People's Republic of Mozambique are threatening to become the order of the day. Using Namibia as a buffer to protect white supremacy in South Africa and as a base from which repeated acts of aggression are committed against its neighbours  Pretoria and its UNITA bandits are carrying out a scorched-earth policy in the south of Angola where untold misery is a common plight  the common plight of the people who live there. The cost in destroyed economic infrastructure runs into billions of dollars.Of the nine countries of the Southern African Development Co—ordination Conference (SADCC)  only the United Republic of Tanzania has not been physically affected by South Africa's war of destabilization. For the rest  the magnitude of the havoc wreaked by destabilization is ghastly. It is estimated that between 1980 and 1986 the cost in destroyed social and economic infrastructure in the SADCC States is roughly $US 30 billion. This is infrastructure SADCC needs desperately if its member States are to liberate their economies from South Africa's economic colonialism.But there is another cost which cannot be quantified: the cost in human life. How does one put a price on the massacred victims of Homoine  Majacaze  Mandimba  Mechungwe and Sena in Mozambique? How can we put a price on them?And yet the RENAMOs and UNITAs of this world still have friends here from the Western world and elsewhere. South Africa is not alone in playing godfather  employer and financier to them. They still get weapons and stinger missiles from some Members of this Organization. There are those who seem to derive comfort from the bloody carnage in southern Africa so long as their own interests  be they ideological or simply racist  are served.The countries of SADCC have no capacity to wage war against South Africa  not is it their intention or ambition to acquire such a capacity. They have sought to devote their meagre resources and the energies of their peoples to the development of their economies in an endeavour to lessen their dependence on South Africa and to promote regional economic integration in the spirit of the Lagos Plan of Action. In this endeavour they have sought and received the assistance of the international community  it is what we do with this assistance - the bridges  oil storages  hospitals  schools and several other socio-economic infrastructures in the SADCC countries - which the bandits and their South African supporters are reducing to rubble. Is this what the people who give us aid want to see happen to their aid? Do they want to give us aid to build schools and hospitals only to allow them to be turned to rubble by their friend  the South African Government?We appeal to the international community to help us end this madness. All we want for the countries of SADCC is to be allowed to develop our economies in peace and tranquillity. That is all we ask of the international community.The Middle East has continued to be a hotbed of tension. There appears to be no willingness on the part of Israel to countenance the establishment of a homeland for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel continues to spread Jewish settlements in the territories it captured in war. Meanwhile  Palestinians remain in squalid refugee camps all over the Middle East  with no respite in sight to their misery.Botswana does not accept the supposed incompatibility of the existence of the State of Israel within internationally recognized borders alongside an independent homeland for the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza. We believe that that is the only sure basis for durable peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours. My Government does not accept the policy of might is right  and we will never accept it. The Jewish people who have suffered for so long should not be the ones to show so much insensitivity to the plight of others  especially people with an equally sound and legitimate historical claim to the land of Palestine. The long-talked-about international conference on the Middle East must be convened with the full participation of all parties to the conflict  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  because we believe that therein lies the hope for peace in the area.I speak as one who comes from a war-torn region  but I still find the continuation of the Gulf war incomprehensible  for this is a war that really benefits no one  especially the two protagonists. The destruction it has wreaked on the economies and lives of the peoples of the two countries is horrendous and unspeakable. We appeal to the two sides to implement the recent Security Council resolution 598 (1987)   calling for a cease-fire and an end to these hostilities.On the questions of Kampuchea and Afghanistan  we remain unshakeable. We remain convinced that withdrawal of foreign troops in each case would constitute a first important step to normalizing the political life of these two war-torn countries. Meanwhile  my country will continue to encourage international efforts whose aims are to find lasting negotiated solutions to both questions. We have noted in both cases that  indeed  efforts of one form or another have been made to try and promote solutions through dialogue. But as long as foreign troops remain in those two countries we remain convinced that the best way the United Nations can approach the problem is to ask that those troops be withdrawn.The problem of Western Sahara continues to defy solution. One party to the conflict has just completed the building of the so-called defence wall. This move can only create more stumbling-blocks in the search for peace in the Maghreb. We reiterate our conviction that the good offices of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations remain the only logical means whereby the parties to the conflict can engage in a free and fair dialogue aimed at allowing the process of self-determination to take place in the territory.The question of Chad is important to us. That the people of that war-torn African country have never known peace since they attained their independence is a painful fact known to us all. This is why we attach a great deal of importance to the current efforts of the OAU to bring an end to the conflict. And we ask all strangers to that purely African conflict to stay away from it - very far away from it - and to refrain from inflaming the passions of the belligerents and making business out of the fratricidal horrors between those sister African countries Chad and Libya Looking at the Latin American region  we are encouraged that after a period of inactivity on the diplomatic front concrete steps have been taken to bring peace to the region. The agreement signed by the leaders of Costa Rica  Nicaragua  Honduras  Guatemala and El Salvador in Guatemala City in August has the potential to end fratricidal strife in Central America  if given a chance. It is our fervent hope that outsiders will not find other excuses to sabotage these efforts for their own selfish ends. Let the people of Central America lead the way to their own destiny. Let nobody tell them how they must run their own affairs. We similarly invest our hopes in dialogue in the search for solutions to the problem of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) . The United Nations has always been ready to assist Argentina and the United Kingdom to resolve their differences at the conference table. The sooner they co-operate in this crucial endeavour  the better for peace and tranquillity in the South Atlantic.Botswana's position has not changed on the question of the reunification of Korea  because the factors that tutored us into adopting that position have not changed. We remain adamant in our insistence that: first  the two Koreas must be unified peacefully; secondly  there must be dialogue between the two sides to resolve common problems; and  thirdly  there should be no foreign interference in such a dialogue.On the question of war and peace  Botswana welcomes the ongoing negotiations between the super-Powers aimed at reducing their nuclear arsenals. We have no doubt that any significant reduction upon which they can agree on this score will be welcomed by all nations. We urge them to persevere in this constructive endeavour.The holding of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development in New York during the period 24 August to 11 September this year was long  long overdue. Although its results were not anything dramatic  the Conference nevertheless explored many worth-while possibilities that deserve serious attention in the future. The fact that there is an organic relationship between disarmament and development can no longer be in dispute.Resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council must not be taken lightly or dismissed with the kind of contempt to which we have grown accustomed. The image and credibility of our Organization are not enhanced by the very painful fact that Cyprus remains an occupied country despite the adoption of Security Council resolution 365 (1974) and General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX)  indeed  the indications are that the grip of occupation is tightening. That is very sad  foe Cyprus is a non-aligned country with impeccable bona fides  a Commonwealth member of no mean import and a third-world country whose only crime apparently is to have been placed by geography and fate  like my own country  near a powerful neighbour. Cyprus must not be allowed to perish under the heavy boot of military occupation. The United Nations must prevent this from happening. The independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment of that harmless and peaceful island are very important  at least to the continuance of the precarious existence of small countries of the third world.The OAU has finally adopted a declaration of its own on the protection of human rights. This is as it should be  for as newly independent countries  some of which are literally still trying to find their feet or bearings  we have a lot of human rights to protect  because the process of growing up following decades of colonialism is not always a peaceful one. None the less  we deeply believe that no human life should be devalued on any basis whatsoever  be it ideological  religious  ethnic or racial.We pay homage to the High Commissioner for Refugees for his selfless dedication to the cause of refugees. We have found his work invaluable and would urge increased support for him in his difficult task.The terrorism perpetrated by individuals  groups of individuals and States which have lost their sense of humanity is a universal scourge. My country is pleased to note that there is now a concerted international effort to combat this scourge in all its aspects or branches  including State terrorism. States enjoy no exemption  regardless of their size and the power at their disposal. All forms of terrorism are evil and must be fought without let.Drugs also continue to wreak havoc in the world. The young generation of today is a hallucinated generation. We note with satisfaction the outcome of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  held in Vienna this past summer. The steps and remedies that were agreed there roust be implemented without delay. The United Nations may not have been able  in the 4 2 years of its existence  to satisfy all our expectations in the struggle for the creation of a better world for mankind. Indeed  the agenda before us clearly shows that we still live in a dangerous world - a far cry from the kind of world envisaged by the founding fathers of the Organization. But we are not bereft of hope. The United Nations is the best human edifice ever built. Our imperfect world would have been far worse without it. So I reaffirm my country’s unshakeable faith in the Organization  and I say this with the confidence and hope that it can still use all its potential to respond decisively to the needs of our troubled world in order to remain faithful to its principles and attain its objectives.

"24",1156,"CAF",42,1987,"﻿It is a great honour for me to extend to Mr. Florin of the German Democratic Republic  on behalf of His Excellency  General Andre Kolingba  President of the Republic  Head of State and founding President of the Central African Democratic Assembly  the warm congratulations of the delegation of the Central African Republic on his election to the presidency of the (General Assembly at its forty-second session. His personal qualities  his ability  and his great experience will ensure the success of the session.I also take this opportunity to extend to his predecessor  Mr. Huraayun Rasneed Choudhury  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  the thanks of my delegation for the very able manner in which he discharged his duties.To the Secretary-General of our Organization I confirm the support of the Central African Government for his steady efforts to ensure a greater role for the United Nations in the search for peace  security and international co-operation.Lastly  on behalf of my delegation  I should like to congratulate Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed on his appointment as Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs.It is two years now since our critical  rigorous and perceptive analysis of the 40 years of existence of the United Nations  The hope born of the ""new pragmatism"" which was cited by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization  and which offers""... a promising basis for broadened multilateral co-operation and increased effectiveness of the United Nations"" (A/42/1  p.2)  must not conceal the fact that our system is still in a state of crisis. It is a crisis because of the chasm between the aspirations of most peoples for a new world order and the ability of the system to make a real contribution towards solving the problems that arise from those aspirations. It is a crisis as regards collective security  specifically as regards the maintenance of collective peace and security  for the structures of the United Nations are not always able to operate in accordance with the Charter  for obvious reasons.Accordingly  the changes the world is undergoing today make the revitalization of the United Nations imperative since its credibility depends on an effective and vigilant system that can promote good management of international co-operation.. Political will and deep-reaching structural reforms adapted to the current context of international relations could indeed enable the United Nations to emerge from the crisis and fulfil its mission as set forth in the Charter.For some time now the United Nations system has found a new vitality in resolutely committing itself to organizing multilateral aid for development and  above all/ providing a framework for major negotiations on the future of international economic co-operation. The United Nations would like to be accepted to a greater extent as playing the principal role in the search for this new world order to which all States legitimately aspire.In this context the work of bodies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the World Health Organization (WHO)  the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is decisive.This aspect of the Organization's work  while it has been properly identified only very recently  has nevertheless led to a short increase of confidence in the United Nations on the part of third world countries  in particular African countries  whose overall situation worsens routinely from one session to another.In this century of extraordinary scientific progress and unprecedented accumulation of wealth in the northern hemisphere there are still countries desperately seeking the means of survival. Yet we note that despite that harsh reality it is still difficult to arrive at a consensus on what solution should be provided.Africa's economic situation was described without any window dressing by the African States themselves at the recent special session of the United Nations on the critical economic situation in Africa just a year ago. A United Nations Programme of Action for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa 1986-1990 was then adopted. The assessment that is to be made will enable us to see how far we have gone in applying that Programme  for whose implementation we are all responsible  for  after all  we made a solemn commitment to ensure this.The Central African Republic  while it was establishing the bases for the new Central African society  whose Constitution describes the outlines of our system  has for the last six years been undertaking an extensive  thorough going reform at the social and economic level. The action taken has involved tremendous sacrifices on the part of the Central African people and  although to varying degrees  it has been possible to attain the development objectives sought by the Government  primarily food self-sufficiency.However  the Government's work cannot be strengthened  broadened and developed unless there is a propitious international environment. The fall in world prices of commodities  including coffee  cotton and wood  which are the bases of the Central African Republic's economy  will simply cancel out the work done by our Government if a concrete and resolute International dimension is not provided as well.An improvement in the world commodity prices combined with an increase in aid and the granting of loans on favourable terms should make it possible for the Central African Republic to see its work crowned with success.The round table on the Central African Republic held last June in Geneva  at which General André Kolingba  President of the Republic and Head of. State  himself participated  was not only part of the framework for strengthening the economic and financial recovery that has since been undertaken  but also an opportunity to reassure the immensity of the work done. The interest demonstrated by various friendly countries and some financial institutions give ground for our Government to be cautiously optimistic and we hope that there will be greater participation in the economic take-off of our country.I should like to extend my Government's thanks to the current and future partners of the Central African Republic  which  fully respecting the principle of the sovereign equality of States and reciprocity  have provided and will provide assistance towards our development.On a broader scale and on the same lines  African countries have long since become aware that real progress in development requires that their peoples be assured at least a minimum  above all  of food. Therefore agriculture is still our top priority  but the development of agriculture involves vast efforts in the spheres of education  training  health and an adequate mobilizing infrastructure  It is therefore essential that the African countries have access to credit and  ideally benefit from a major transfer of financial resources for this purpose. It goes without saying that in the search for the means to promote agriculture the stabilization of the prices of commodities  the basis of our economy  and an increase in those prices are of paramount importance.Our situation can never improve unless there is a real solution to the question of the foreign debt of African countries. This is essential to the recovery of the African economy  which is itself vital to the health of the world economy. In any event  one thing is clear: the foreign debt of African States is now well beyond the ability of their economies to repay.The sustained attention given by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to this problem and the fact that one of its sessions will be especially devoted to it bear witness to this. While General André Kolingba  President of the Republic and Head of State  restated to the partners of the Central African Republic at the round table in Geneva the intention of the Government to honour all obligations entered into by the Central African Republic regarding its creditors  he added:""It is  however  clear that our resolve is limited by our resources  which in turn depend on the authorities you represent.""This is why the Central African Republic wishes to join those who  since the Quebec Summit  both elsewhere and in this Hall  have paid well-deserved tributes to Canada  which has decided to cancel not only the debts of the French-speaking countries of Africa but also  at the forthcoming meeting in Vancouver  those of the Commonwealth countries.This remarkable and exemplary action reminds us of the action taken by the Federal Republic of Germany  to which the Central African Republic extended its thanks when it cancelled our debts earlier.But  as was emphasized by the Secretary-General in his report to the forty-first session  we face a human problem and a human solution must be found to it so that beyond new individual attitudes there may be a concerted approach at the intergovernmental level.The search for solutions to the serious economic problems of the day is possible only if there is an atmosphere of trust in relations between States. But the lack of trust  the division of the world and fear result in the spiralling arras race  involving the use of enormous resources for purposes that go well beyond the requirements of national security. This trend has become an end in itself  even though the Powers already have the means to destroy the entire human race.The arms race is thus a real threat to international peace and security and is certainly an obstacle to development  because major resources are devoted to it when they could have been used for development. This point was made recently at the Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development which  incidentally  emphasized the close interdependence between disarmament  development and security. Therefore  everything must be done to ensure the achievement of general and complete disarmament. But the primary condition remains the easing of tension in relations between the Powers that have committed themselves to the arms race  and here I mean primarily the two super-Powers.The agreement concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union on reducing medium-range missiles can  above and beyond the principle that it establishes  be regarded as opening up the path towards that easing of tension.This is something that my delegation welcomes. We ardently hope that at the third special session of the United Nations on Disarmament the international community can establish the outlines of the strategy to bring about disarmament.However  while the strengthening of relations of trust between States has to be ensured through effective disarmament  a balance requires respect for the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination  as also the principles of the equal sovereignty of States and non-interference in their internal affairs. It is failure to respect those principles that leads to continuing hotbeds of tension throughout the world.The African land of Namibia must become independent without any preconditions whatsoever under the leadership of its authentic representative  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). The Security Council must shoulder its responsibilities and demonstrate political will to ensure the implementation of its plan for that Territory.In their daily struggle to build a new society  the majority of the South African people must participate in the management of the affairs in their country. To that end  it is essential to dismantle the abhorrent system of apartheid. That is a precondition for the restoration of peace in South Africa and  hence in southern Africa as a whole. The international community must continue to mobilize its efforts to that end.While the resolve with which Chad  a neighbouring fraternal country  has endeavoured to defend its sovereignty - in other words  its right to survive — has been commensurate with the threat facing it  my delegation still believes in the virtues of a negotiated solution to the Chad-Libyan border dispute  and we welcome the action taken by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity on this question  which indeed represents an effort to seek a definitive settlement of the dispute.The Central African Republic believes that such a settlement should make it possible to re-establish the territorial integrity of Chad  which is essential for the legal Government of the Republic of Chad to continue the work of national reconstruction in which it has been engaged. We thus appeal to the interested parties not only strictly to comply with the Lusaka recommendations  but also  as they have undertaken to do  to co-operate sincerely in those efforts. Other members of the international community should be involved in them if they truly hold dear peace and the rule of law  so that peace can at last return to that area.It cannot be repeated often enough that the situation in the Middle East requires that account be taken of the interests of the Palestinian people  and particularly of their right to a homeland  so that a settlement may be arrived at that would put an end to the sufferings that have been imposed upon them. My delegation  while confirming the right of the State of Israel to existence  would again state that it is only through the convening of an international conference on the Middle East  involving all the interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  that a real contribution can be made to the search for a settlement.The fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq has caused tremendous loss of life and there is a clear danger of the situation becoming internationalised. Given the breach of peace in that region  only a bold initiative along the lines of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) can provide a just and lasting solution to the conflict. My delegation  which greatly appreciates Iraq's constant willingness to seek such a solution  which can be seen from its acceptance of that resolution  calls upon the other party to abide by it. We also call upon other States to refrain from any action that could worsen the situation.The use of occupation as a means of crushing the soul of a people is contrary to the principle of freedom held dear by the United Nations. That is why Democratic Kampuchea must at last be enabled to exercise all the attributes of its sovereignty in accordance with United Nations principles. The principle of freedom must also be observed in the case of Afghanistan so that its people may begin the procedure of democratisation  which they so ardently desire. The right to decide their own destiny in all freedom must be recognized. Accordingly  foreign troops must be withdrawn from Democratic Kampuchea and from Afghanistan.The situation in the Korean peninsula is still a matter of concern  in view of the threat to peace in the region. In this connection  my delegation believes that the principle of peaceful reunification must be observed and that at the same time direct dialogue  without outside interference  should be resumed between the two parties. This does not exclude the possibility that in the meantime they may  together or separately  request admission to membership in the United nations  in whose system they already participate.In Central America  the cause of peace has finally triumphed in the form of the Agreement recently arrived at among the five States of the region on the procedures to be followed to bring about a stable and lasting peace in that part of the world. My delegation welcomes this  and trusts that the international community will make its contribution to promote a positive outcome.Above and beyond these major challenges  the basic characteristic of this century remains the desire of the peoples for peace. After all  the Charter that brings us all together begins with the solemn commitment of the peoples of the United Nations to establish the necessary conditions for the advent of peace. It is thus up to the Member States that represent those peoples to contribute  in action and through sustained and consistent political will  to the emergence of new international relations marked by justice and equity.They certainly have the political will to do so; that is evident from the many dialogues - which have often been difficult  incidentally - that have taken place in dealing with many issues of great importance involving the question of security and international economic co-operation. For the Central African Republic  this political will must be expressed by giving the United Nations a greater role in managing international co-operation within the framework of efforts to bring about the new international order "
"25",1200,"CAN",42,1987,"﻿I should like to begin  Sir  by extending my and Canada's congratulations and appreciation to you on your assumption of the responsibilities and office of the presidency of the General Assembly.A year ago the atmosphere in the Assembly was heavy with a sense of crisis. The financial shortfall of the United Nations  serious in itself  was also a symptom of a deeper worry about the very existence of the Organization.Canada  and other friends of the United Nations  used this rostrum to call for reform. I am pleased today to note that substantial reform has begun. 7hat is both a tribute to the men and women who make this Organization work and testimony to the recognition by most nations that a strong United Nations is essential to world peace. We are especially impressed by the United Nations resolve to extend reform beyond the institutions in New York to United Nations economic and social institutions throughout the world.For our part  Canada made a point of paying our 1987 assessment fully and early. We hope other nations will quickly pay their current and past assessments. Those that call for internal reform have a particular obligation and opportunity to encourage it once it begins. That good example would increase the pressure upon other Powers whose contributions are consistently delinquent.During the past year this real internal reform has been matched by solid progress on many of the major issues of concern to the United Nations. Sometimes that progress occurred outside this multilateral Organization - as  for example  in the historic breakthrough on an arms agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union  in the steady pressure against apartheid mounted by the Commonwealth  and in the initiative towards peace launched by the five Presidents of Central America. But in many other cases the world's movement forward was rooted here. Those cases are worth enumerating.In the ongoing war between Iran and Iraq  Security Council resolution 598 (1987) reflects a welcome political will and unanimity in the Security Council  and the Secretary-General is to be commended for his patient  persistent mediation. The Secretary-General's mission was not as successful as we all had hoped. And the speech this morning by the President of Iran can only be characterized as destructive and deeply disappointing. Therefore the Security Council should be reconvened to take the next step. Canada would fully support implementation of the axiomatic second half of resolution 598 (1987) - the application of sanctions.At the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)   the consensus statement on trade  debt and commodities may presage a new era of co-operation between developed and developing countries. UNCTAD VII was an example of an international conference for whose outcome the prognosis was uniformly gloomy. The doubters were wrong. The United Nations scored a major success.The special session on Africa is beginning to yield concrete results  albeit there is a long way yet to go. The international community clearly now recognizes that the majority of African countries are making great efforts to turn their economies around. But the international community must equally recognize that the debt situation for many African countries is desperate and must be addressed in new and innovative ways or the entire recovery programme may collapse.In that context  we welcome the Secretary-General's appointment of the Advisory Panel on Resource Flows. We anxiously await its report. As the representative of Zaire has just indicated  Canada is so concerned about this issue that at the Francophone Summit we announced the cancellation of official development assistance debt for several countries in francophone Africa. Next month  at the Commonwealth Conference  we will do the same for countries of Anglophone Africa.	 The Brundtland Commission has produced a blunt and clear report on the urgency of protecting our resources and environment. In that spirit  in Montreal last week nations signed an ozone Treaty controlling the emissions of chloro fluro carbons. Dr. Mostafa Tolba  Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme  called it ""the first truly global treaty that offers protection to every single human being on this planet."" Our Government believes that Montreal Treaty will serve as a model for future international agreements on the environment.The Conference on disarmament and development  which has just concluded  yielded a remarkable consensus document  holding disarmament and development as essential to international security. It graphically demonstrated the capacity of the Organization to find agreement in the most complex fields.The World Health Organization is recognized as a crucial resource for gathering the statistics and carrying out the planning that are necessary as countries struggle to master the world-wide AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) epidemic.Within its own doors  the United Nations has made social strides in another field: the equal rights of women. In 41 years there had not been even one woman permanently appointed as an Under-Secretary-General. Now there are three  and we in Canada take particular satisfaction that the first woman appointed is an outstanding Canadian  Madame Therese Paguet-Sevigny  under-Secretary-General in the Department of Public Information There have been other achievements in the past year: the successful Vienna international Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking; the coming into force of the Convention against torture  the International Maritime Organization draft convention on maritime security; and the progress made on verification by the United Nations Disarmament Commission  with which Canada is proud to be associated. This is proof of the worth and vitality of the United Nations and clear evidence of the advantages to be derived from continuing to confront the world's problems together.The great purpose of the United Nations is to extend the reach of peace and justice in the world. Sometimes  as in the war between Iran and Iraq  its role becomes most acute when all other efforts have failed. In other cases it can encourage regional initiatives that may lead to peace where peace is threatened  or focus international attention upon injustice that must end. I want today to speak of one initiative that we must encourage and one injustice that we must end. The Initiative is in Central America  where the presidents of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua have joined together in a genuine effort by all parties to settle their differences peacefully. The surprisingly positive outcome of the Guatemala summit meeting was the result of many factors. They included the foundations laid by Contadora and the Contadora Support Groups  the preparatory work of the Central America countries and the concessions made at the summit by each of the five presidents. That achievement was applauded by us all. But it was only the first of many steps along a difficult road.Canadian aid to Central America has been steadily increasing  as has our funding and our acceptance of refugees. We have expressed our view that the root problem in Central America is poverty  not ideology  that the real need is development assistance  not military activity  and that intervention by outside Powers will only aggravate the tension. We have supported the Contadora process and have made available to Contadora the expertise Canadians have acquired in the techniques of peace-keeping.Immediately after the Guatemala summit two senior officials of our Government visited Central America to discuss what more Canada might do. I will be visiting the region myself later this autumn.Canada supports the initiatives of the Central America presidents. We are prepared to provide our expertise in the design and development of verification and control mechanisms which  once peace is possible  can help it endure. The disputes must be resolved by those actually Involved in the conflict  but Canada is prepared to contribute to that process in any direct and practical way open to us.The injustice to which I referred earlier is apartheid. Canada's position is clear and on the record. We have acted upon all of the sanctions recommended by the Nassau Conference of the Commonwealth Heads of Government. We have Imposed a ban both on new investment in South Africa and re-investment of profits. We have banned the importation of coal  iron and steel. We have banned the promotion of tourism and ended air links. In the first six months of 1987 Canada reduced its imports from South Africa by 51 per cent. Furthermore  we have made it clear that  if other measures fail  we ate prepared to end our economic and diplomatic relations with South Africa  We are helping the victims of apartheid with scholarships  legal aid and other assistance. We contribute substantially to the development of the front-line States  both bilaterally and through the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). We apply our influence  whether it is effective  to build the pressures against apartheid.The Prime Minister of Canada met with the leaders of Zimbabwe and Zambia and Botswana in Victoria Falls in February  and I visited southern Africa six weeks ago  a visit which included a meeting in Pretoria with the South African Foreign Minister. Olivet Tambo visited Ottawa a month ago and met with our Prime Minister and other Canadian leaders. Early in September it was our honour to act as host to the second summit of La Francophonie in Quebec City  which condemned apartheid and established a scholarship programme for black South Africans. Next month  in Vancouver  we shall act as host to the heads of Government of the Commonwealth  the international family to which South Africa once belonged.We are at a critical stage in the campaign to end apartheid. There must be no relenting in that campaign  no pause in the pressure  because a pause might suggest that apartheid is acceptable  and it is not. The pressure against apartheid must continue and increase  and the challenge  in the United Nations and elsewhere  is to find peaceful and effective means to build that pressure. It is not enough to ask others to act.It is Canada's view that the sanctions imposed upon South Africa have been effective  both economically and psychologically. While the Government of South Africa has reacted by limiting liberty even more  growing numbers of individual South Africans have reached out for reform  in meetings in Lusaka and Dakar and in the private contacts  which we must multiply.The instability in southern Africa is both an ally and a product of apartheid. One of the most wrenching conversations I have had was with Canadian aid workers in Mozambique who fear that the projects they build to help people will become targets of terrorists and put at risk the very lives they are working to improve. An essential part of the challenge in southern Africa is thus to bring more stability to the front-line States.Before I conclude my remarks I want to applaud again the new vitality that has been injected into the global arms-control and disarmament process through the important announcement that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed in principle to eliminate intermediate and short-range nuclear missiles. Radical reduction in nuclear arms has always been the core of Canadian policy in this area. We should celebrate the fact that this is the first time a prospective agreement will actually eliminate nuclear weapons. That is just the initial step in a long and difficult process  but  with continued determination and resolve  we can hope to move to agreements on strategic weapons  on chemical weapons  on conventional weapons  and on a comprehensive test ban.I began by talking about the atmosphere of crisis which was so pervasive as we met last year. Today  we must all surely take satisfaction from the atmosphere of hope that surrounds us; hope  because both globally and regionally there is a recognition that a peaceful and secure world is of universal benefit and worthy of relentless pursuit) hope  because the social and economic evils that beset us are being addressed in a meaningful way) and  finally  hope  because this Organization of ours  the United Nations  is reasserting its capacity to play the central role that it was created and designed to play in dealing with the ills that still plague the international community. The United Nations agenda stretches before us - Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Cyprus  peace in the Middle East between Israel and the Arab States  an end to terrorism  and the fundamental human struggle to eradicate hunger and injustice. Somehow  it feels as though we are closer this year than last to tackling that agenda."
"26",1261,"CHL",42,1987,"﻿I wish to convey our greetings to Ambassador Florin of the German Democratic Republic and press the hope that his term as President of the General Assembly will be beneficial and positive for the work of our Organization.I wish on behalf of my country  to extend to the Secretary-General our deep appreciation for his work and constant dedication to the cause of peace. His work reflects distinction on all Latin Americans.The art of governing  always a difficult task  is especially arduous at the present time. In earlier times  managing and assuring the well-being of immunities lacking expeditious means of communications and dependent to a large extent on their own resources  without a sufficient basis for comparison  was even a formidable undertaking that could bring about discontent and criticism.The advances of civilization  the transformations brought about by science and technology  the accelerating rate of change and life style  and the publicity about goods and services that makes them appear to be easily available  linked with the development of world-wide communications systems  have tended to distort the assessment of the individual and social realities of our peoples. They have urgent  enhanced expectations of progress and well-being which  even though now available only to the few  motivate them all to want to see their expectations realized at the very moment they are perceived.This revolution of expectations  as it has been so rightly called  together with the crisis in moral values  has added to the tasks of governments in meeting the present requirements of their peoples the inescapable obligation to formulate  in accordance with the country's potential  the path  programmes and projects which may enable them to approach the degree of well-being enjoyed by the most developed centres of the world.The responsibility of governing today includes the need to advance development in an internationally comparative context. In policies and actions  it calls for harmonizing the objectives of the more developed communities with the concrete realities and effective potential of the nation being governed.The close interrelationship that now characterizes the life of nations requires more urgently than ever that we become able to regulate our shared existence upon this planet  giving due consideration and respect to our own geographical  political  economic  social  technical  historical and cultural differences. It also requires that we foster a spirit of true unity that will facilitate harmonious progress where equity will prevail over our present and future relations.This Organization  which brings us together  is designed to be the instrument for that profound goal. Its creation and existence respond to one of the most constructive aspirations of nations  and its principles to the common ethical values that should prevail in relations between men and peoples.The complexity of relations in a world vulnerable to confusion and exposed to rival interests and ideologies means that those goals  no matter how lofty  are difficult to realize in a timely and effective way. The greater and the more cherished our aspirations  the more we want to see them promptly realized  and the more we tend to feel frustrated over the slow progress in attaining them.This understandable reaction should not undermine the strength of our determination. Difficulties cannot halt the progress of this integrated process  if difficulties do arise  they should  on the contrary  provide added impetus to rededicating ourselves to achieve our goals. Many have maintained that the efforts of the United Nations have not succeeded in leading to the high objectives that have been established. Certainly it is not difficult to point - as has been done on other occasions in this forum - to the frustrations of the international community at the frequent failure of its deliberations and conclusions to lead to successful results.The world's stage is still the scene of wars  violence  discrimination  fundamental social deprivation  various forms of assault on the life of the individual and the society  scorn for or indifference to the weak and helpless  conquests and disturbing disinformation. Certainly there is no shortage of elements that could give us a feeling of frustration or impotence.But if  at the same time  we consider the sustained and varied efforts relating to conflicts and the prevention of problems that could become insoluble  the benefits obtained in the most diverse technical fields  the agreements on the use of resources and the fact that we can meet to deal in a civilized manner with the anxieties in the world today and the uncertain tomorrow  a negative judgement is not warranted.We are building international understanding  and this in itself is difficult because of the growing complexity of the situation. Perhaps we shall not attain it in a short time  but our most responsible determination consistently to support the effort is more than justified. We shall thus be able to face the future creatively and with a shared effort  and therefore to face future generations with the sense of responsibility that they have a right to require of us. We must leave them an inheritance of peace  understanding and progress  not just problems that we could not or did not decide to resolve. We know that the world is far from having exhausted its potential for well-being. We are aware that we have forged instruments that enable us to work together. We must pursue faithfully the measures already initiated by those who preceded us. We must use and perfect those instruments for the good of mankind and our peoples. We shall not allow temporary problems or crises  no matter how serious  to divert us from this constant and overwhelmingly important objective.If we adhere firmly to that decision  we shall find ways to reform the world society and give it a sense of solidarity in the spirit that His Holiness pope John Paul II has repeatedly urged us to show. We must give force and vigour to the principles that must inspire our relations  seeking peaceful solutions to controversies  respecting the self-determination of peoples  rejecting intervention in the national affairs of sovereign States  respecting international treaties and seeking an international order that benefits all and ensures lasting peace and progress.Motivated by these convictions  my country welcomed with particular satisfaction resolution 598 (1987) on the Iran-Iraq war  adopted unanimously by the Security Council on 20 July 1987. The aim of that resolution was to re-establish harmony in the region and bring to an end a confrontation that has brought suffering to two developing nations that need peace. We ate new following with special concern the developments in that area.Similarly  we are following the efforts to achieve disarmament and remove the danger of a nuclear confrontation. We hope that the improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union will make it possible to arrive at a balanced and just agreement that will remove this factor of uncertainty for mankind.Similarly  we welcome the promising agreements signed in Central America and hope that they will lead to deeds that make a reality of the aspirations on which they are based. We hope  too  that they will benefit the sister nations to which we have been linked by close bonds throughout our history.In view of these positive developments  it is our duty to note with concern that  unfortunately  there are actions that do not fall within that pattern of peace and respect. There are untrammelled acts of support for violence and terrorism which call for the attention of the international community. The phenomenon of terrorism  with its cruelty and the advantage that permits it to act against society anywhere  against any of its members and with anonymity  tends to divide the organized community no matter what its social  economic  cultural or political characteristics.This is a scourge that affects the basic principles and values of mankind  and every possible effort must be made to eradicate it. It is  to say the least  deplorable that there are still terrorist movements that can count on support from Governments that approve of their activities. In order to confront this evil it is necessary  on the basis of a firm  universal decision  to put a strategy into practice in which all civilized countries participate. My country makes this special appeal with the greatest determination  since it is well known that we have been the victim of serious  repeated terrorist acts  and the international community has had proof of foreign interference.Similarly  we must express our concern over the many actions that reflect Intervention in the internal affairs of other nations. International coexistence requires that  together with a sense of unity in progress  we must respect that which is within the exclusive competence of each sovereign nation or State. There must be no intervention in the internal affairs of other nations or interference in the free self-determination of any people. The great Powers have a special  clear responsibility in this field. Balance will be achieved with the ability of each and every nation to mould its own destiny responsibly. Opposing or intervening in their sovereign and free decisions can lead only to undermining the true foundations of this balance and creating situations that do violence to that reality. We must not forget that neither power not wealth constitutes legitimate grounds for assuming the role of an arbiter of international morality or a mentor of the historical processes of another country. We must denounce as unacceptable foreign interference in national plans  in so doing  we are not rejecting the conventional limitations established in respect of human rights. International regulations govern the field of human rights  and we certainly do not reject them. We regard them as relevant so long as they are applied faithfully  without partiality or political prejudice  and so long as they are not involved out of mere convenience.However  the arbitrary use that has been made of these legal instruments for political purposes has  on many occasions  exceeded agreed international jurisdiction and has thus eroded the principle of non-intervention  in such cases  responsibility does not rest with the great Powers alone.It is therefore essential to refine the human rights system  both substantively and procedurally - the latter with regard to both organic and functional factors. To the degree that the bodies of regulations are refined and duly respected  we shall not only be preserving the principle of non-intervention  but the cause of human rights will thereby gain greater protection.In this regard  we wish again to express our concern that the Middle East continues to be a region in which peace has yet to become a part of the lives of its peoples. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) are designed to provide an effective foundation for the consolidation of peace in that region. In this respect  as we have said here  and as we wish to reiterate  there must be recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including its right to form a sovereign state  and of the need to arrive at just agreements that guarantee the peace and security of all peoples  including that of Israel so that they may live within secure and internationally-recognized boundaries. We are also deeply concerned by the tragedy experienced by the Lebanese people. We have very close links with that country; many sons of Lebanon have found a second homeland in Chile. We express the hope that Lebanon will overcome its problems and that peace and harmony will be restored to that country.We regret to note the absence of progress on the question of Namibian independence. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) provides a just and realistic solution for the Namibian problem that would ensure the self-determination of its people  its territorial integrity and its unity. We support the efforts of the international community and those of the Secretary-General and the Council for Namibia in this regard. But we are concerned at the politicisation of this cause within the Council and the introduction of extraneous matters  which  far from favouring the cause of Namibia  tend to disturb the situation even further.We also deeply regret to note the continuance of the tragedies in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. In Kampuchea  despotic Soviet imperialism  acting through one of its satellites  continues to act with violence and cruelty. The tragic situations of those countries deserve profound and critical thought  and praise is aroused for the courage of those who are resisting the invader and striving to maintain their national identities and achieve freedom.The complexities and difficulties of those situations prompt us to continue to give the Secretary-General all the support he deserves in continuing to pursue his initiatives in Afghanistan and prompt us also to give continued support to Prince Sihanouk in his unwavering efforts on behalf of his people.In Korea  the situation continues to be troublesome. We must emphasize that negotiations between the Korean peoples  without foreign interference  constitute the only viable way to address this problem and find a realistic and peaceful solution. In this regard we recognize the efforts being exerted by the Government of the Republic of Korea. We believe that the presence of the two Koreas in this Organization would facilitate contact between the parties and the finding of a peaceful solution to the problem. We should thus be complying with the principle of the universality of the United Nations  to which we attach great importance.To those disturbing questions we must add the grave problem caused by the imbalance of the economies of the industrialized countries and the absence  thus far  of decisions for structural reform - decisions that should be more than mere simple responses to temporary situations and should restore stability and lead to the disappearance of the uncertainty now prevailing in international trade. Because of its scope and nature  this problem requires multilateral attention that will lead to the improvement of situations that now compromise the development of nations  especially those most in need of development. There have been indications of a spirit of understanding of the needs of the developing countries - for instance  the decision to grant 1 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries to development programmes for the developing countries. But that has not gone beyond a declaration of intention; it is not actually happening.We trust that these problems will eventually be solved because  as is well known  the developing countries are actually sending their creditors  the developed countries  more than they are earning from their exports. And their earnings are already deteriorating because of adverse terms of trade and protectionist initiatives. We must never forget that situations of Imbalance such as this have their limits and  if prolonged in the absence of a planned solution  they may cause incalculable damage to the detriment of everyone.Before concluding  let me add some specific comments about my country  which is going through a historical period of particular importance - a period that  it would appear  the international community does not always wish to understand Chile has demonstrated and maintains the deepest interest in contributing to the activities of the Organization  to the best of its ability. As one of the founding Members of the United Nations  and a faithful participant in its programmes and initiatives  we have spared no effort to co-operate as regards its lofty aims and purposes. For more than 40 consecutive years  we have pursued this consistent line of conduct  emphasizing our respect for the rights of other nations and their sovereign freedoms.We must emphasize the unlimited co-operation my country has given to the special rapporteur on human rights  despite the unacceptable discrimination implied by the exceptional treatment involved. We have acted thus because our principles and values correspond to the essential ethic of our traditions and culture and because we desire understanding and peace. In an eminently constructive fashion and as a contribution to international understanding  my country - unlike others that have not  fortunately  had such experiences - was a victim of an attempt to destroy its sovereignty and its identity  a threat that it was able to overcome thanks to the resolve of its freedom-loving people. In 1973  we began a process of national recovery and of reconstruction of an economy that was falling apart. Despite the world's economic crises  which have seriously affected us  we have brought our economic and social situation to levels that have drawn praise from the most diverse international circles.It also proved necessary for us to undertake the political reconstruction of the country in order to recover and strengthen its freedom. Chile set for itself a programme and a schedule  on a broad juridical basis approved by the people  for overcoming the ills it had suffered and restoring full democracy. Prom that time on  through the sovereign will of the people  we have proceeded to take each of the steps set in advance for carrying out the fixed schedule. Chile is making progress towards the establishment of a modern  solid  stable democracy. Because of its experiences up until 1973 and of the problems of the past  we have had to put forth every possible effort to achieve that objective. It is Chile's intention that its new democracy should be fully consistent with the complete freedom of the Chilean people and that their participation in the fate of their Republic should be expressed not only at the polls but in every aspect of daily life.The socio-economic structure of the country is therefore based on a fundamental preference for private enterprise and respect for property rights. The role of the State has been reduced so that it has now been assigned a subsidiary function  with preferential attention of significant proportions being given to the eradication of extreme poverty. I have indicated that the responsibility of government implies the need to plan development in a competitive international context. Today  a whole set of interests are emerging that affect the international community. This is doing away with the traditional inertia and the tight compartments within which nations used to carry on their debates.New concepts of co-operation are emerging  which are leading countries to an awareness of the need to pool their efforts to face these problems. Development and the use of our resources should not be indiscriminate. On the contrary  everything must be done in a responsible fashion for the benefit of the community.In addition to the recent economic and financial problems that have demanded international attention  there are now others such as those resulting from man's own activities affecting his very future and environment. The deterioration of the ozone layer and pollution of the seas are some examples of the challenges man must face if he wishes future generations to continue living on this planet.International co-operation  the conceptual development of which has been extraordinary in this century  will have to increase greatly if we are to meet the threats that man himself has created.We are facing a new situation  and in that situation the United Nations will play a central role. Its Secretary-General is already warning us about the need to begin thinking of reformulating some instruments of co-operation for that purpose. Their efficiency will be strengthened if there is harmonious agreement to that end.It will be our joint endeavour to embark upon that task for the benefit of all. Let us nurture this rebirth of international co-operation with optimism. We trust that the peace and harmony we shall gain from it will make the task of government an increasingly efficient one for the benefit of our peoples. "
"27",1307,"CHN",42,1987,"﻿In the name of the Chinese delegation  may I begin by warmly congratulating you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I am sure that with your ability  wisdom and experience  you will fulfil this noble mission with distinction. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation and thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Choudhury  for his positive contribution to the work of the previous session.Over the past year  people of the world have made unremitting efforts on various fronts in pursuit of peace and development and achieved new and encouraging results. The third world and many small and medium-sized countries have played an active role in international affairs  exerting an increasingly great influence. This shows that the forces for peace have grown in strength. There have been ever-stronger demands for a halt to the arms race and to aggression and expansion  and for genuine disarmament and an early settlement of regional conflicts. Under the circumstances  the United States and the Soviet Union have kept up their dialogue and there has appeared a somewhat relaxed atmosphere in East-West relations.However  factors causing international tension and turbulence are still present. The arms race  far from coming to a halt  is extending into outer space and other high technology fields. None of the hot-spots in the world has been removed  and certain regional conflicts even threaten to escalate. The world economic situation remains grim. Many developing countries are faced with increasing difficulties and the North-South contradiction has become more acute than ever. All this cannot but cause grave concern to China and all the other countries which uphold justice and strive for peace and development. In order to join in a common search for effective solutions to those problems  I now wish to set forth the Chinese Government's position and propositions. It is the universal demand of the world's people and the consistent stand of the Chinese Government to stop the arms race and to remove regional conflicts. Effective disarmament constitutes an important link in the efforts to ease international tension and to maintain world peace. Since the resumption of the Geneva arms control talks between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1985  we have all along hoped that they would  through serious negotiations  reach agreements conducive to world peace and not detrimental to the rights and interests of other countries. Now there has been progress in their intermediate nuclear forces (INF) talks. The two sides have reached agreement in principle to adopt the global ""double-zero option"" on long range intermediate nuclear forces and short range intermediate nuclear forces. We hold that dialogue is better than confrontation  and relaxation better than tension. World peace is indivisible  and European security and Asian security are equally important. If the United States and the Soviet Union could formally conclude an INF treaty and implement it by thoroughly destroying all their long-range intermediate nuclear missiles and short-range intermediate nuclear missiles deployed in Europe and Asia  that would be a first step towards nuclear arms reduction and would undoubtedly be welcomed.Of course  there is still a long way to go and much work to do before genuine disarmament can be realized. Even with the long range intermediate nuclear forces and short range intermediate nuclear forces dismantled  the nuclear weaponry of the United States and the Soviet Union would only be reduced by less than 5 per cent and each would still retain a nuclear force capable of destroying the world several times over. To maintain world peace and security  there should be complete prohibition and thorough destruction of all types of nuclear  space  chemical and biological weapons as well as other weapons of mass destruction  and a substantial reduction of conventional arms. The people of all countries long for development in peace. Disarmament is an urgent task  but the disarmament talks have been proceeding very slowly  since the INF talks alone have dragged on for almost six years  negotiations on strategic arms reduction or other disarmament issues will be even more difficult. If things move along at this pace  when could the approximately 50 000 nuclear warheads ever be destroyed completely? When could the above disarmament goals ever be reached? Naturally  the international community strongly hopes that the United States and the Soviet Union will drastically reduce their armaments as soon as possible  and that after reaching an INF agreement they will proceed to conduct earnest negotiations on disarmament in other areas and reach agreements followed by effective implementation. They should not stand still  let alone vie with each other in developing new types of even more sophisticated weapons in the wake of an agreement to dismantle INF missiles.In order to promote disarmament  the Chinese delegation last year submitted to the General Assembly two draft resolutions on nuclear and conventional disarmament  which were adopted with the broad support of other United Nations Members. The two draft resolutions emphasized that the countries possessing the largest arsenals bear a special responsibility for disarmament and should take the lead in drastically reducing their nuclear and conventional armaments. This is the key to progress in disarmament. In the world today  it is the United States and the Soviet Union that possess the largest nuclear and conventional arsenals  and they alone are capable of launching a world war. if they could take the lead in drastic arms reduction  the threats to world peace would be greatly diminished.China has not only actively put forward its views and proposals on disarmament  but has also taken a series of concrete actions towards disarmament. On the very first day when China came into possession of nuclear weapons  in 1964  we declared unilaterally that at no time and under no circumstances would China be the first to use nuclear weapons. We have also undertaken not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States or nuclear-free zones. We neither advocate nor go in for nuclear proliferation; we do not help other countries develop nuclear weapons. China respects and supports the countries and regions concerned in their endeavour to establish nuclear-free zones or zones of peace on the basis of voluntary agreement to be reached through consultation among themselves. We have signed the additional protocols of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. Furthermore  in recent years we have stopped atmospheric nuclear testing  reduced the size of our armed forces by one million and cut down our military expenditures. We have also shifted some military industrial facilities to civilian production and put some military installations to civilian use or dual use.Disarmament is an arduous and complicated task. Progress in disarmament requires the good faith of the countries concerned and  more importantly  the persistent efforts of all peace-loving countries and people. On the question of disarmament  which concerns the future of the world and the destiny of mankind  all countries  whether big  small or medium-sized  nuclear or non-nuclear  should have an equal say  and each has a positive role to play. Europe experienced the holocaust of two world wars and is now a place of direct confrontation between the two major military blocs. East and West European countries are particularly concerned about disarmament  which is closely related to their own security  and have played an important role in promoting the United States-Soviet arms control talks. When addressing the question of disarmament  the legitimate rights and interests and reasonable proposals of every country should be fully respected and taken into serious consideration.  Disarmament agreements of any kind should help to enhance the security of every country and region in the world and not to weaken Here I should like to refer to the recently concluded International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which unanimously adopted the final document through the concerted efforts of all sides. That Conference is of positive significance in heightening the international community's awareness of the close relationship between disarmament and development A fair and reasonable settlement of regional conflicts and the elimination of hot-spots are of great importance in easing international tension and safeguarding world peace. Despite the efforts made by the United Nations and by many justice-upholding countries towards this end in the past year  no substantive progress has been made so far. That is essentially because certain countries  in disregard of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the basic norms governing international relations  have refused to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions and have persisted in their policies of aggression and expansion. They have continued their occupation of other countries' territories and have kept encroaching upon others' sovereignty and interfering in others' internal affairs. As a result  regional conflicts have been continuing and it is difficult to remove the hot-spots in the world. China Is consistently opposed to the threat or use of force In International relations and Is all the more opposed to acts of aggression and Interference against other countries by any country under whatever pretext. It Is our view that the commission of aggression by one country against another Is the most serious international crime  which must in no way be confounded with the Internal problems of the country under aggression. China has always maintained that the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful co-existence should be strictly observed by all countries in the world. We are in favour of a fair and reasonable political settlement of any regional conflict  because it is in the fundamental interests of the countries concerned and of world peace.To achieve a fair and reasonable political settlement of a regional conflict  the primary requirement is to stop aggression and expansion against  and terminate military occupation of  other countries. Foreign troops must immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the territories they occupy  and the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the countries under aggression must be restored. No country can get away with keeping the gains of aggression and expansion under the pretext of a ""political settlement"".To achieve a fair and reasonable political settlement of a regional conflict  it is also necessary for the people of the countries or regions concerned to solve their own problems  free from outside interference  and to observe the principle of genuine self-determination. Disputes between States should be settled by the countries concerned through negotiations  in line with the basic norms governing international relations. Internal disputes of a country should be settled by its own people. To achieve a fair and reasonable political settlement of a regional conflict/ all parties concerned must observe the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the five principles of peaceful co-existence.The key to the settlement of the Kampuchean question lies in Viet Nam's cessation of its aggression and the speedy withdrawal of all its troops from Kampuchea. The United Nations General Assembly has adopted many resolutions in this regard. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (AS£AN) and other justice-upholding countries have also made sustained efforts to seek a political settlement of the question. Under the pressure of international public opinion  the Vietnamese authorities have over the year talked a lot about a ""political settlement"" but have in fact failed to show any sincerity. Their stubborn position of aggression and expansion has remained unchanged. Up till now  they have continued with their military occupation of Kampuchea under various pretexts  in defiance of the relevant United Nations resolutions. Being clearly the aggressor  the Vietnamese authorities bear an unshirkable responsibility on the question of Kampuchea. Yet  they brazenly try to disguise themselves as an outsider  insisting that Kampuchea's ""national reconciliation"" must come before their troop withdrawal. The kind of ""political settlement"" they have proposed is  to put it bluntly  designed to make the International community accept the Vietnamese aggression and occupation of Kampuchea as a fait accompli  prop up a Vietnamese-controlled ""government"" and ensure the Vietnamese vested interests gained through aggression and expansion. This is of course unacceptable to the coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  the ASEAN countries and all justice-upholding countries and people.China seeks no self-interest in Kampuchea. Our principled position on the Kampuchean question is to safeguard the norms governing international relations oppose aggression and uphold justice. We consider it essential to include in earnest the relevant resolutions of the previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly  we support Prince Norodom Sihanouk  the ASEAN countries and the United Nations Secretary-General in their efforts to seek a just and reasonable settlement of the Kampuchean question. The eight-point proposal on a political settlement of the Kampuchean question put forward by the coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk is fair and reasonable. It has won extensive sympathy and support from the international community and should serve as the basis for the settlement of the Kampuchean question. We are confident that provided Viet Nam withdraws all its troops from Kampuchea under international supervision  the Kampuchean people  led by the prestigious  great patriot Prince Norodom Sihanouk  will solve their internal problems through consultation free from outside interference  effect true national reconciliation and choose their new government through United Nations-supervised free elections  so that Kampuchea will become an independent  peaceful  neutral and non-aligned country. This will be in the interest of peace and stability in that region and in the rest of South-East Asia. Once the parties concerned reach agreement on a settlement of the Kampuchean question  China will be ready to join other countries in a relevant international guarantee.The ""cease-fire"" declared by the Kabul regime has not put an end to the war in Afghanistan. As a matter of fact  the encirclement and suppression of the resistance movement  the killing of innocent civilians and incursions into Pakistan have been going on all the same. As long as the foreign aggressors do not	.withdraw  the war of resistance to aggression will not stop. It is clear that ""guarantee first  troop withdrawal next"" or ""reconciliation first  troop withdrawal afterwards"" are nothing but excuses for putting off the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. If the Soviet Union really wants a political settlement  it shouldcomply with the relevant resolutions of successive sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and withdraw all its troops from there as soon as possible. This is the key to the settlement of the Afghan Question and the only way to heal the ""bleeding wound"". We support Pakistan and other countries concerned and the United Nations in their efforts for a fair and reasonable settlement of the Afghan question. It is our hope that Afghanistan will regain its status as an independent  sovereign  neutral and non-aligned country at an early state.The convening of an international conference on the Middle East question under the auspices of the United Nations is a feasible way to seek a peaceful settlement of the said question. The Chinese Government supports the United Nations Secretary-General's efforts towards this end. We hold that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  recognized internationally as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  has the tight to participate in the conference on an equal footing with other members. China is always opposed to the Israeli policy of aggression and expansion and firmly supports the just struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples to recover the occupied territories and restore their national rights. We sincerely hope that the Arab countries and the PLO will remove their differences through friendly consultations  close their ranks and co-ordinate their actions in a common endeavour towards an early  just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question.At present  the situation in the Gulf is becoming more turbulent  with sharp confrontation in the region. The Chinese Government has expressed grave concern over this. We have all along taken a position of neutrality and of promoting reconciliation between Iran and Iraq and have urged them to bury the hatchet as soon as possible  engage in peaceful reconstruction and strive for further development rather than wearing themselves out in the war. Security Council resolution 598 (1987)"" adopted unanimously by the Security Council through concerted efforts by all the members reflects the strong desire of the international community for e speedy end to the Iran-Iraq conflict and has provided a good basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. We appreciate the valuable contributions made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the implementation of this resolution and support him in his continued endeavours to ensure this. China has made and will continue to make efforts to promote comprehensive implementation of the resolution. With the desire to see an early end to the sanguinary conflict and the restoration of peace stability and prosperity In the Gulf region  the Chinese Government once again calls upon Iran and Iraq to stop immediately all their military actions and to implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987) in real earnest  in co-operation with the Security Council and the Secretary-General  so as to seek a just  reasonable and comprehensive settlement of the Iran-Iraq dispute. The Chinese Government also calls on the parties concerned to exercise restraint and ensure free and safe passage in the international waterways in the Gulf. It further calls on the big Powers to stop their military involvement in the Gulf so as to avoid escalation of the conflict  leaving the littoral countries of the Gulf to solve the Gulf problems themselves through consultations.Over the past year there has been an ever-surging movement in South Africa and Namibia  with a steady growth of the struggle against the foreign rule and for national liberation and independence. The South African racist regime  though more and more isolated  la clinging obstinately to its apartheid system and brutally suppressing the South African people. It has kept Namibia under its illegal occupation and wilfully harassed its neighbours  trying hard to delay and Obstruct settlement of the problem of southern Africa. The Chinese Government strongly condemns the perverse acts of the South African authorities. We will  as always  firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of South Africa  Namibia and the rest of southern Africa. We call on the international community  and particularly countries that have influence with South Africa  to support the struggle of the peoples in southern Africa and  through further pressure and effective sanctions  force the South African authorities to abandon their policies of apartheid and of destabilizing the neighbouring countries and implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978) unconditionally  thus paving the way for the early independence of Namibia.Recently  an important step forward has at last been taken in the peace process in Central America after repeated setbacks. The document entitled ""Process for the establishment of firm and lasting peace in Central America""  signed more than a month ago at a summit meeting of five Central American States  is of positive significance in easing the tension and turbulence in the region. That document gives expression to the desire of the Central American States for peace and is a result of the peace mediation of the Contadora and Lima groups. We sincerely hope that all the parties concerned will respect the hard-won achievements of the meeting so as to facilitate the smooth implementation of that accord and bring about peace and stability in Central America at an early date without interference from outside.Tension on the Korean peninsula can be eased only through reduced military confrontation and increased contacts and dialogue between the north and the south of Korea. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has recently put forward successive proposals  such as phased disarmament by both the north and the south  withdrawal of United States troops and tripartite talks by the north and south of Korea and the United States at the Foreign Minister level. Those proposals are constructive and reasonable and we hope that they will receive a favourable response from the parties concerned.The present world economic situation is yet another major issue about which the international community is deeply concerned. Over the past year economic growth in developed countries has remained slow and the economic friction among them has been exacerbated. The developing countries are faced with unprecedented serious difficulties owing to their worsening external economic environment. The prices of many of their primary products have remained at the lowest level since the end of the Second World War  while the export of their manufactured goods has been hindered by ever-increasing trade protectionism. The export earnings of the developing countries have plummeted  while the inflow of funds has dropped drastically. The debts of developing countries  which exceeded $US 1 trillion last year  are weighing more and more heavily on them. Under the circumstances  their economic growth on the whole remains very slow and their difficulties are mounting  although they have made strenuous efforts to achieve economic readjustments or reforms. In the case of the least developed countries  there are even more difficulties.The world economy is an integral whole. The North and the South need each other and are interdependent. The economic stagnation and growing poverty of developing countries are bound to affect the world economy as a whole and  naturally  the economic growth of the developed countries. Those that benefit the world will benefit from the world. The developed countries should do their best to improve the world economic environment and help developing countries overcome their economic difficulties. To this end  we wish to put forward the following propositions.First  the developed countries should adopt measures to stabilize the prices of primary products and provide financial assistance to the developing countries for diversifying their export commodities so as to help stabilize and increase their export earnings. Secondly  the developed countries should honour their commitment to reduce and stop protectionist trade practices. They should also expand the treatment granted to the developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences. The interests of the developing countries should be taken fully into account in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations.Thirdly  the developed countries should try to fulfil as early as possible the official development assistance quotas set by the United Nations and provide more funds to the developing countries in other forms. International financial bodies should also make efforts to provide funds to the developing countries on favourable terms in the light of their actual conditions.Fourthly  debtor and creditor nations  international financial institutions and commercial banks should share the responsibility for the solution of the debt problem and agree upon practical measures through continued dialogue so as to reduce as much as possible the debt burdens of the developing countries.Fifthly  special preferential treatment should be given to the least developed countries in respect of trade  funds  assistance and debt  and effective measures should be adopted to implement the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  approved unanimously by the special session of the United Nations General Assembly last year.During the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held not long ago there were extensive discussions on such questions as the development of resources  commodities  world trade and the least developed countries  thereby creating favourable conditions for the furtherance of the North-south dialogue. We hope that at the current session the General Assembly will make new progress on this basis in its deliberations on the Questions concerned. We hold that the developed and developing countries should continue and step up dialogue and work together to establish a new type of North-South relationship  a just and rational relationship based on equality and mutual benefit  so as to strengthen international co-operation and revitalize the world economy.China is marching forward along the road of building a socialist society with Chinese characteristics. Now  stability and unity prevail throughout the country. Reform and the open policy are being implemented steadfastly. The Chinese economic registers a sustained and steady growth  and the people's living standards keep improving. Of course  we are fully aware that China's productive forces are cooperatively weak and its economic relatively backward. China is still at the Initial stage of socialism. During this fairly long historical period  our main: task is vigorously to expand the productive forces so that China will gradually lift itself out of poverty  backwardness and underdevelopment. To this end  we must persist in reform and opening up at home and to the outside world  work hard to develop a planned commodity economy and continue to expand our economic and technological exchange and co-operation with other countries in the world  leading to a dynamic and rapid development of the productive forces. The forthcoming thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will review the historic changes that have taken place in China in the past nine years  reaffirm a series of fundamental principles and policies that have proved effective and give a theoretical exposition of reform and the open policy. The Congress will draw up new plans aimed at accelerating and deepening the economic structural reform  and work out a blueprint for political structural reform with a view to promoting the cause of socialist modernization.Like reform and the open policy  China's independent foreign policy of peace is also our fundamental State policy which will remain unchanged for a long time. By pursuing this policy  China aims at both securing a lasting international environment of peace for our socialist modernization drive  and fulfilling its responsibilities and obligations for world peace and development in tune with international developments. The policy is in keeping with the fundamental interests of the people both of China and of the world as a whole. By persisting in reform and the open policy as well as in the independent foreign policy of peace  China will develop faster and contribute more to mankind.As the most important global organization of our time  the United Nations is playing an important role in maintaining peace  promoting development and strengthening co-operation. We are glad to see that such a role is being further strengthened. At its last session  the United Nations General Assembly adopted - through efforts on various sides - the resolution on the strengthening of administrative and financial efficiency of the United Nations. At present  the United Nations is at a critical juncture of its reform. We support this world body in its efforts to introduce necessary and rational reforms so as further to improve its efficacy and give better expression to the purposes of the Charter. The United Nations is the Organization of all the countries in the world  and it needs the support of all its Member States. It is our hope that the big Power directly responsible for the current financial difficulties will fulfil its obligations as provided for by the Charter. As a permanent member of the Security Council  China will  as always  strictly abide by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and discharge its obligations in real earnest. We are ready  together with other Member States  to make our contributions to further strengthening of the role of the United Nations in its many areas of endeavour."
"28",1387,"CMR",42,1987,"﻿Allow me  Sit  first of all to join previous speakers in conveying to you my delegation's warmest congratulations on the occasion of your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. We have particular pleasure in seeing you preside over our work since you are discharging your task so gracefully. You are once again giving proof of your eminent qualities as a diplomat. As a member of the General Committee  Cameroon can assure you of its full support in the accomplishment of your task.My delegation wishes also to salute your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Choudhury  who directed the work of the General Assembly at its forty-first session with skill  firmness and courage.Lastly  my delegation wishes to express to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar its gratitude not only for his constant efforts to improve the functioning of our Organization and to enable it to attain its objectives  but also for his dynamic contribution to the achievement and maintenance of peace in the world.For a country such as Cameroon  born of the work of the United Nations  it is gratifying to note that after the more than 40 years of its existence and in spite of the countless difficulties that assail it  our Organization is still the ideal context for joint discussion between nations  large and small  rich or poor  in the political  economic  social  cultural and legal fields. In this period of increased uncertainty  this Organization is proving to be even more useful as a place for harmonizing the views of States that are in favour of establishing international relations on the basis of justice and equity. We are here to express once again Cameroon's firm commitment to the goals  purposes  principles and objectives of the Charter  which the founding fathers of the Organization established as positive norms of conduct on the part of nations.Here we should like to express our very strong concern with regard to everything that runs counter to those norms: the unbridled arms race  particularly in regard to nuclear weapons; the striking economic inequalities and injustices; the persistence  indeed the aggravation  of many areas of tension; the spirit of selfishness  power and domination; the rivalry of hegemony  interests and ideologies that characterize contemporary international relations. Rarely in time of peace has the world known such uncertainty.There is uncertainty in particular in regard to the current economic situation and its social repercussions  which ate gradually undermining the resilience of the life of States  particularly the developing States  to the point of jeopardizing the progress patiently achieved in the search for well-being  international co-operation and peaceful coexistence.Today  the world is confronted by an economic crisis the most pernicious effects of which are striking the countries of the third world  particularly in Africa. This crisis has attained unprecedented proportions. Indeed  the combination of persistent protectionism and foreign trade imbalances  the slow-down in world economic activity and growth  the high level of unemployment and underemployment  the abrupt drop in the price of raw materials  the marked deterioration in the terms of trade  monetary and financial disorder  the crushing weight of external debt  are striking evidence of this crisis. The long-term outlook gives no sign of definite improvement despite the hopes aroused by the attempts at economic recovery. While it is true that sustained efforts are necessary to reverse these negative trends  first of all at the national level  some types of measures require concerted action  taking into account both the solidarity among States and the special situation of the developing countries. The situation of the African countries is of the utmost concern and it is no exaggeration to say that the African continent is still the real victim of the crisis.Aware of these difficulties  our Organization held a special session here last year to take measures to restructure the economic bases of the continent in the context of the Lagos Plan of Action and the Priority Programme of Action for the Economic Recovery of Africa.Cameroon  which has always held that the development of Africa is first and foremost the responsibility of the African countries themselves  supports every effort to promote and strengthen regional co-operation.On the national level  the Government of Cameroon has always sought to promote a sound  vigorous economy that could ensure not only growth but also harmonious development for all. Thus  in order to meet the crisis  our Government has taken measures to rationalize both structures and management. In order to have their full effect as soon as possible  these measures must be supported by a more favourable international environment.In this respect there is reason to welcome the measures announced by the Seven at the Venice Summit  but it is to be hoped that those measures  which are also in line with the concerns of the United Nations  will be put into practice as soon as possible. We wish in particular to welcome the recent initiative by Canada to cancel the entire public debt of certain African countries south of the Sahara and its intention to extend this action to other countries at the next Commonwealth meeting. It is our hope that this example of solidarity may be followed by others.At its seventh session  held at Geneva in July 1987  the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development produced encouraging results  particularly in regard to debt  resources for development  commodities  international trade and the least developed countries. We hope that there will be fruitful discussion this session on the Secretary-General's progress report  looking towards next year's assessment of the commitments undertaken by African countries and by the developed countries in the context of the economic recovery of Africa. In view of its disastrous impact on the well-being of our peoples  the critical economic situation in Africa ought to be the only object of our concern. But  unfortunately  that is not the case  because other hotbeds of tension are igniting  growing and persisting in our continent. I am thinking of Western Sahara  Chad and  above all  southern Africa. For some time  we have seen possibilities for the peaceful settlement of the situation in Western Sahara. In that connection  we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about the implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions. In our view  solution of the problem of Western Sahara requires the holding of a referendum on self-determination for the Sahraoui people  under United Nations auspices. As concerns Chad  a neighbour of Cameroon  we have noted substantial progress since the forty-first session. The process of national reconciliation has been completed. The legitimate Government has restored the country's independence and unity. The question of the Aouzou Strip  now before the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  remains outstanding. Cameroon unreservedly supports OAU efforts to reach a negotiated settlement of the conflict between Chad and Libya. My country welcomes the belligerents' acceptance of a cease-fire.The OAU Ad Hoc Committee  of which Cameroon is a member  whose task is to enable the two belligerents to settle their dispute through negotiations  met last September at Lusaka at the level of Heads of State or Government. Cameroon supports without reservation the committee's recommendations  which called upon the belligerents  inter alia  to make available to it by 30 October 19tí7 at the latest all relevant documentation in support of their contentions  and to continue and strengthen the cease-fire at all levels by refraining from any action that could exacerbate the situation on the ground  including the over flight of air-space  land incursions  troop concentrations  the recruitment of foreign troops  and so forth. Cameroon urges both parties to co-operate sincerely with the OAU ad hoc committee in the speedy achievement of a lasting settlement of their dispute.In southern Africa the tragedy continues. The racist regime of Pretoria  in defiance of international opinion  persists in bolstering the heinous system of apartheid. Among the manifestations of that arrogant policy of violence are arrests  massacres and the indefinite extension of the state of emergency. The travesty of elections held last May  in which only the white minority participated  clearly belies the alleged desire of the proponents of apartheid to bring about real constitutional reform in South Africa.Beyond its borders  racist South Africa challenges the international community and this Organization by continuing its illegal occupation of Namibia and by carrying out direct and indirect aggression against the independent countries of the region. Given that climate  one must salute the courage and clear-sightedness of the liberal white patriots who are working inside South Africa itself towards the advent of a multi-racial democratic society.In the light of the deteriorating situation in Namibia and the intransigence of the Pretoria regime  we support the recommendations of the recent ministerial meeting of the United Nations Council for Namibia  which  inter alia  called upon the Secretary-General to hold consultations with the members of the Security Council  in particular its permanent members  with a view to their making a firm commitment to the unconditional and prompt implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  adopted nearly a decade ago. It goes without saying that we reiterate our support for the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole  authentic representative of the Namibian people.There is no doubt that the situation in southern Africa poses a grave threat to international peace and security; it must be dealt with accordingly. The permanent members of the Security Council bear a special responsibility and have a vital role to play in bringing Pretoria to its senses. Those countries are committed champions of human rights and freedoms  and we hope they will shoulder their responsibilities in this case of flagrant violation of those rights and freedoms. They must ensure the success of comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions as a means of exerting pressure upon the racist regime of Pretoria. It is highly important to stress that the hatred  frustration and despair born of the situation in southern Africa could ultimately prevent national reconstruction in South Africa and the other States of the region  and will greatly reduce the chances of success for a policy of reconciliation and good-neighbourliness.For our part  we firmly believe that someday South Africa will be forced to renounce its policy of violence at home and aggression abroad and will take the path charted for it by history and by the international community  the path of working towards a free  democratic and multi-racial society at home and  abroad  accepting Namibia's accession to independence and territorial integrity under the leadership of SWAPO and developing relations of co-operation and good-neighbourliness with the other countries of the region.Outside Africa  there are other hotbeds of tension and political and military conflicts. I am thinking of the Iran-Iraq war  and the situations in the Middle East  Latin America  Asia and other areas. In connection with those situations we support all efforts at achieving a peaceful settlement based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant United Nations resolutions.The economic crisis and the hotbeds of tension I have just outlined provoke us to thought  and mobilize our energies and our resources. They also serve as a pretext for the feverish arms race. My delegation views this with extreme concern. We deplore the fact that the present trend is for the world to place its intelligence and the vast potentialities of science and technology not at the service of economic and social development  but rather at the service of the terrifying stockpiling of means of destruction which  fat from guaranteeing the future of mankind  expose it to annihilation. My country would like to appeal once again to the international community to reduce armaments and hotbeds of tension. Cameroon welcomes the agreement in principle reached between the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate intermediate-range missiles. It should be recognized that this agreement is in line with the search for peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. It is to be hopes that more far-reaching measures will be adopted at the forthcoming meetings between the two countries. Cameroon will also welcome any other initiative which the two countries might take to increase world security and stability.It is of the greatest urgency actively to promote disarmament in the interest of development. Our concern must continue to be the search for genuine peace and security so that the human  technological and financial resources now being devoted to armaments may be channelled towards economic development. The fact that a few weeks ago the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was held here is eloquent testimony to that concern. However  it is regrettable that on the whole that Conference failed to achieve the hoped-for results.The Conference did not sufficiently explore the concept of security in all its economic aspects. Need we recall that the true bases of security today are to be found in economic justice and equity? The essential concern of the developing countries remains development. The importance of security has already been demonstrated  but there can be no security without development. In today's world our security is threatened also by hunger  poverty  disease and illiteracy.However  in spite of the very meagre results achieved  the Conference rightly reaffirmed the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. In addition  it officially recognized for the first time at the international level the close connection between disarmament and development. Most important  it very clearly demonstrated the international community's very acute awareness of and its political commitment to the survival of mankind. That primary objective must form the core of all our future debates on disarmament and development. We venture to hope that the next special session of the Assembly on disarmament will be able to examine all these ideas in greater depth.At the dawn of the twenty-first century  setting aside rhetoric and relying on the enormous advances of science and technology  the international community must undertake a daring programme to promote disarmament  extinguish hotbeds of tension and revitalize the economic recovery of the developing countries. We must mobilize to restore balance and equity in trade  the financial field  currency  technology  industry  transport and communications.Reforms currently being undertaken within the Organization must be directed along that path. In the final analysis  such reforms must reinforce the democratisation of international relations so that all countries may actively participate in the conduct of world affairs  on which our common destiny depends.The international community has many advantages. It must become aware of the fact that the adverse effects of inadequate development do not end with the disinherited of mankind  but are continually spreading. For its part  Cameroon cherishes the hope that  with a new awareness  the peoples of the United Nations will choose survival and take the necessary practical steps  both on the political and on the economic and social levels  to ensure it.May this present session begin to blaze the trail to that goal.

"29",1429,"COD",42,1987,"﻿Mr  President  at this forty-second session  reflecting as it does the maturity of our Organization  it is fitting that the General Assembly should have honoured one of its most deserving servants who has devoted much of his diplomatic career to the United Nations. Hence  I am particularly pleased to congratulate you warmly on this honour  which is indeed the highlight of all the work you have done for the international community. This election means that our Assembly will enjoy the invaluable assistance of one of its most faithful supporters  a prestigious witness to both its difficulties and its greatness. As representative of a divided country  you can better than anyone else comprehend the horrors and consequences of conflicts and wars that have torn mankind apart and remain the basic raison d'etre of the United Nations. I assure you. Sir  of the full co-operation of my delegation both within the General Committee of the forty-second session - of which Zaire is a member - and throughout your term of office as President of the General Assembly.My delegation wishes to express its gratitude to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury whose well-known experience and diplomatic talents contributed so much to the successful conclusion of the General Assembly's work at a particularly difficult time. The delegation of Zaire is very pleased to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose ability  resolve and courage have earned him his reputation as a man who is committed to defending the cause of our Organization. From the excellent report he has presented to us and the various dangerous missions he has carried out on behalf of this Organization  it is evident that as he begins his second term of office he is endeavouring to give this Organization the renewed impetus and vigour necessary for a rational operation.He is supported by another great diplomat  Mr. Joseph Verner Reed  virtuous great human and social qualities we all recognize and whom we all know as a most affable person  and whom I should like to congratulate on his appointment as Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. My delegation is convinced that the new team will prove to be extremely effective. In the great undertaking of the reforms now under way  the Secretary-General can be assured of the support and contribution of Zaire.As the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations opens  many conflicts and hotbeds of tension and imbalances of all kinds characterize the world scene. Some States Members of this Organization  far from being inspired by the ideals  objectives and lofty goals enshrined in its Charter ~ particularly those that concern the maintenance of international peace and security  the development of friendly relations between nations based on respect for the principle of the equal rights of peoples  the territorial integrity of States and the attainment of international co-operation - have persevered in making demands that create threats to international peace and security.At the same time  the most acute crises afflict much of mankind in the form of drought  famine  wretchedness and poverty. According to statistics made public on 11 July 1987 by the United Nations  some 5 billion human beings face challenges that are world-wide rather than national in scope and that amply justify the concerns being expressed by all Member States in this forum  the General Assembly of the United Nations.The United Nations  as catalyst for the contemporary values  is thus called upon to seek by all means possible the emergence of an atmosphere of trust  peace and co-operation among all the nations of the world.Following the marking of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  that highest of objectives  the formation of a better world  must win the support of all Member states through a common resolve to apply Article 33 of the Charter  which calls on parties to any dispute likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security first of all to seek a solution through negotiation  mediation or other peaceful means of their own choice.In this context commendable efforts have indeed been made by the General Assembly since the first special session on disarmament  held in 1978  whose ' conclusions  enshrined in its Final Document  should inspire all Member States of our Organization and be applied by them if we wish to save mankind from any danger of a nuclear holocaust.Security  an essential element of peace  has always been one of the most deeply felt aspirations of mankind. States have sought to preserve their security through the possession of weapons  and some have survived because they have had them. But in our time the build-up of weapons  particularly nuclear weapons  presents an even greater threat to international peace and security.The second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  held in 1982  had the merit of proposing a whole series of measures designed to speed up the process of general and complete disarmament through specific proposals in the form of a comprehensive programme of disarmament. The Conference on Disarmament  which meets in Geneva - my country is a member - has distinguished itself by preparing that programme under the leadership of an outstanding diplomat  a Nobel laureate. Ambassador Garcia Robles of Mexico Consideration of that comprehensive programme of disarmament under agenda item 66 - and this was the programme submitted by the Conference on Disarmament - will enable the General Assembly to gauge the importance of the initiatives taken by the 40 members of the Conference on Disarmament. Moreover  at its thirty-ninth session  in resolution 39/160 of 17 December 1984  adopted without a vote  the General Assembly noted that world-wide military spending had acquired a staggering magnitude and that the global trend continued to be towards a faster rate of annual increase in those expenditures.Accordingly it decided to convene an International Conference with a view to establishing a close relationship between disarmament and development. That Conference  held recently in New York  from 24 August to 11 September  emphasized the international community's resolve to achieve disarmament and development as factors that strengthen international peace and security and promote prosperity.However they are two distinct processes  and the Assembly recognized that one should not slow down the development or evolution of the other  for development activities cannot wait for resources to be made available through disarmament. Moreover  disarmament has imperatives that are at variance with the objective of releasing resources for development. But  above all there is a close correlation between disarmament and development  which are linked by a multidimensional relationship.Should this close correlation between disarmament and development not encourage the nuclear Powers to ensure both the disarmament and development of underdeveloped countries and thus promote peace in the world? The special responsibilities incumbent on the nuclear Powers have been cited very often  particularly those of the two super-Powers to speed up the process of nuclear disarmament so that negotiations can be held with a view to the swift conclusion of the agreement limiting strategic weapons and the adoption of measures to prevent the unleashing of nuclear war and the use of force in international relations.Against this background  my delegation would join others in saying how pleased we were at the agreement concluded on 18 September 1987 in Washington between the two super-Powers with regard to the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. This indeed indicates noteworthy progress in a historic process of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.The summit meeting of the super-Powers is therefore awaited with great interest with a view to the conclusion of the agreement that has now been achieved by the foreign ministers.In addition to that agreement  my delegation would like to see other effective measures taken to prohibit or prevent the development  manufacture or use of other weapons of mass destruction  with high priority given to the conclusion of an agreement on the elimination of all chemical weapons. My delegation is convinced that at their summit meeting  the two super-Powers will be able to achieve further and more tangible results in working towards true nuclear disarmament.Thus we will enter a new era of detente and optimism in the relations of trust between those two super-Powers which will lead all States towards a lessening of tension at the international level and will provide guarantees to States that do not have nuclear weapons that such weapons will not be used.While an atmosphere conducive to dialogue does prevail between the two super-Powers  this is unfortunately not the case in respect of the racial communities of South Africa  where that shameless system regarded by the United Nations as a crime against mankind - the policy of apartheid - still exists. That policy of racial discrimination denies the fundamental rights of the black majority population and thus runs counter to the most elementary principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. The heroic  harsh and difficult struggle to combat that hateful system means that the black people of South Africa are increasingly winning the sympathy of some white liberals who had an exchange of views with leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) on this problem at a meeting held recently at Dakar.The mobilization of the working masses in the general strike that paralysed the economic structures of white power heightened the awareness of the black combatants that they were waging a legitimate and just cause.Whether it be the twenty-third summit of Heads of State or Government of the OAU or the Quebec Francophone Summit or the international forums that have considered this situation  all unanimously condemned the minority racist regime of South Africa and called upon it to enter immediately into a dialogue with the authentic representatives of the black people once apartheid had been dismantled and an end had been put to the state of emergency; once all the political prisoners had been released  beginning with Nelson Mandela; once the ban had been lifted on the ANC and other political organizations in that country.The same applies to Namibia  which should long since have acceded to independence but which continues to be illegally occupied by the minority racist regime of South Africa  which established its system of apartheid there.The violence and endless suffering endured by the people of Namibia have in no way diminished the spirit of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in its struggle to gain the freedom and independence to which Namibians are entitled.My delegation would like to state again that implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only valid basis for a settlement of the question of Namibia. It goes without saying that dismantling apartheid will not only enable Namibia to regain its independence  will not only enable the black majority of South Africa to belong to a democratic society not based on race  but it will also ensure that the independent front-line African States will not have to suffer from repeated acts of aggression  sabotage and destabilization carried out by the minority racist regime of South Africa.In Central Africa  the people of Chad are still suffering aggression from a neighbouring African State which  since 1973  has been interfering in its internal affairs  occupying a large tract of its territory  and imposing on it an unjust war involving death and large-scale material destruction. Moreover  that African State is ignoring the principle of the inviolability of borders inherited from the time of independence and is using force contrary to the principles set forth in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations. It is also refusing to participate in any negotiations that are being carried on by the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU on this conflict. Accordingly  my delegation unreservedly supports the inclusion in the agenda of the Assembly of item 140 entitled ""Aggression against and occupation of Chad by Libya"".Whatever the conclusions on the matter that will be arrived at by the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU  the General Assembly  as the forum in which all conflicts are considered pursuant to Articles 33 and 35 of the Charter  will have to take up this question with a view to finding a peaceful settlement.From discussion of item 140 there should emerge a resolution condemning the illegal occupation of Chadian territory by the aggressor and belligerent State and calling for withdrawal from that territory  together with compensation to the Chadian people for the losses incurred.In the north-west of Africa  there is still a conflict with regard to Western Sahara. In his meetings with the leaders of the countries concerned  the Secretary-General of the United Nations spared no effort to try to ensure a peaceful settlement of that problem. As regards the Middle East  20 years ago the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967) which  at the time  was regarded as an important step towards the settlement of all aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Although other resolutions have been adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly on the question of the Middle East  no progress has yet been made. The convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East is still the subject of consultations held by the Secretary-General with all the interested parties. My delegation wishes him every success and hopes that the parties in conflict will no longer be opposed to negotiations in accordance with Security Council resolution 338 (1973).Such is the cost of peace in the Middle East  for it implies justice and equality among all peoples of the region. The Arab people of Palestine  like the people of Israel  are entitled to a homeland - to a State.Consideration of the situation in Asia leads me to look at the situation in Afghanistan and Democratic Kampuchea. Those two countries have been victims of a violation of the principles of political independence and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and the territorial integrity of States. Resolution 41/33  of 5 November 1986  Is still valid  in our view  since paragraph 3 called for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and called on all parties concerned to work for the urgent achievement at a political solution in accordance with the provisions of that resolution and with the need to create the conditions necessary to enable Afghan refugees to return voluntarily to their homes  in safety and honour. Since those provisions have not yet been implemented  my delegation will once again become a co-sponsor of a draft resolution repeating those demands at this session.The same applies to Democratic Kampuchea  which continues to be occupied by foreign troops. In resolution 41/6  of 21 October 1986  the General Assembly once again expressed its conviction that the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea  the restoration and preservation of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country  and the right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own destiny were the main factors in any just and lasting resolution of the Kampuchean problem.There having been no satisfactory developments in this matter since then  the same provisions must be embodied in a resolution again at this session. My delegation will fully support such a draft resolution.Still in Asia  the tension created by the division of Korea into two States persists and is symbolized by the demarcation line in Panmunjon. Appreciation of the contribution made by the peoples of North and South Korea to the work of the United Nations has often been expressed by all Member States  as it has of the contribution made by countries divided after the Second World War.The profound aspirations and enterprising spirit of these peoples should lead the General Assembly and the Security Council to reconsider the question of their admission to membership of the Organization on the same footing as other divided States  without prejudice to the consultations that are taking place between the two parties with a view to unification.The delegation of Zaire cannot pass over in silence the disturbing problem of the Persian Gulf  where a fratricidal war continues between two non-aligned countries  Iran and Iraq  and is extending ever further beyond the regional dimension. The conflict between the two countries is becoming an oil war and is increasingly involving States flying the flags of other States in international waters.The recent mission of the Secretary-General in the Persian Gulf pursuant to Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  although it brought some hope of a peaceful settlement of the conflict  leaves the Assembly perplexed and must encourage all delegations to make use of their good offices with the countries concerned to bring to an end this war which has already lasted seven years.In Central America  the efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group to bring peace and co-operation to the region deserve to be encouraged by all States. Having reviewed the political situation and the problems of the day  we turn to economic problems. In recent years the world economic situation has been marked by a slowdown in the world economy. World production increased by only 3 per cent in 1986  as compared with 3.4 per cent in 1985 and 4.5 per cent in 1984. World production per capita increased by about 1 per cent  which is half the average increase in the 197oa.The world economic situation was characterized in 1986 by sharp fluctuations in terms of trade caused by unprecedented fluctuations in the prices of the principal commodities produced by Zaire and in the exchange rates of currencies.The total foreign debt of developing countries is now almost 41 000 billion  and the ratio of debt-servicing payments and export earnings of the group of developing countries as a whole reached a record level in 1986. Interest payments by developing countries to service their foreign debt# which amounted to more than Ì65 billion in 1986  have continued to restrict their ability to import and to develop  while the net transfer of resources from developing to developed countries has risen to some $24 billion for the second year running. This sombre picture reveals to the international community the outrageous disparities between developing and industrialized countries. The latter have continued to enjoy a generally satisfactory rate of economic growth.My delegation feels that implementation of the programmes of the United Nations Development Decades  the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development and the resolutions adopted at the seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) call for a substantial transfer of resources from both the private and the public sector to the developing countries to finance their development and a satisfactory settlement of the problem of the foreign debt of those countries.My delegation thanks all the creditor countries  and especially Canada  which has agreed either to cancel our public debts or to reschedule some of them. Zaire will work with all those of good will for the establishment of a genuine policy of good-neighbourliness and co-operation  not only with the States of central Africa to create viable economic opportunities for the peoples of the region  but also with all States that cherish peace and justice  to ensure the victory of international co-operation.Zaire shares the preoccupation of the United Nations with the maintenance of peace and is firmly devoted to the ideals and work of the Organization  from which it has greatly benefited in the matter of its unity and the strengthening of its independence. The best demonstration of this devotion is provided by our conduct  which conforms to the principles of mutual respect between States  the sovereign equality of States  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and respect for territorial Integrity.	1The unanimity of those who have spoken in this Hall in support of peace is proof of the incontestable determination of all Member States to live together in harmony  tranquillity and security. My delegation appeals to States Members of the United Nations to commit themselves to ensuring world peace.I wish the forty-second session of the General Assembly every success in itswork. "
"30",1475,"COG",42,1987,"﻿The choice of you  Sir  at the beginning of this session to assume the important duties of President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session is a tribute not only to you as an experienced  well-informed diplomat  with qualities and merits recognized by all  but also to your country  the German Democratic Republic  whose aspirations and central position in Europe mark it out for the path of international peace and co-operation. It is a country with which Congo has excellent friendly relations. I am pleased to offer you. Sir  the warmest congratulations of the Congolese delegation and to express our particular pleasure at seeing you preside over the work of this session. It goes without saying that my delegation will spare neither time nor effort in helping you discharge your important mandate.I wish also on behalf of the Congolese delegation to thank and pay a tribute to your Illustrious predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  for the ability and dedication with which he presided over the previous session.To the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  I present the greetings of the Congolese Government and its thanks for his co-operation and his kindness to us when Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso was Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Indeed  thanks to the good understanding between them  co-operation between this world Organization and the Pan-African Organization increased in quality and effectiveness  to the benefit of our common goals.Lastly  I wish to take this opportunity to welcome the appointment of Mr. Joseph Reed as Assistant Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. His dynamism and ability will  I am sure  be a real asset to the Assembly and the Secretariat.This forty-second session is beginning in an explosive and depressing international atmosphere - explosive because of an increase in hotbeds of tension depressing because for most countries of the third world the economic crisis persists; inasmuch as the reorientation of economic policies and the specific measures taken have responded only partially to the need to check the disease.The state of affairs that I have described illustrates disturbingly and irrefutably how meeting mankind's most immediate aspirations  particularly the aspirations for peace and security  demands a greater political will  a pooling of all possible efforts and energies  to ensure a stable strengthening of the Ideals of the Charter of the United Nations and the promotion of their practical Influence on the conduct of nations.In that regard  I wish to share with the representatives of the international community present today some thoughts that Inspired the people and Government of the People's Republic of the Congo in the light of lessons learned from the carrying out by our country and its President  His Excellency Denis Sassou-Nguesso  of an important mandate at the head of the OAU.As President Denis Sassou-Nguesso has reaffirmed  the United Nations remains the irreplaceable  universal framework  which the world will always need  for assessing  identifying and settling problems involving coexistence on our planet - hence  the need constantly to have recourse to the United Nations and to make the principles of the Charter and the rule of law the mandatory basis for all action that may have international consequences.Therefore  the financial crisis facing the United Nations is above all a crisis of confidence. The uncertainty to which it gives rise is merely a reflection of a posture that does not take into account the march of history  one that wishes to replace multilateralism by a bilateral - even unilateral - approach to the regulation of international affairs. Today the frontiers of peace  security and development can be measured only in the constantly growing dimensions of mutual understanding and the extent of implementation of the principles of justice and equity in international relations. We also have to take into consideration the extent and diversity of the various Individual experiences and situations  outside of models imposed by force  intolerance and threats.We are therefore concerned with the situation in Latin America  Asia  the Middle East and  in particular  Africa  because of the crises which have crystallized in Namibia and South Africa and the critical economic situation in Africa as a whole. We know that the United Nations has studied these problems  but we fear that they may simply become part of the litany intoned at international conferences.Central America is one of the areas of most acute tension in the world. At the eighth Summit Conference of non-aligned countries  last year in Harare the Heads of State and Government ""condemned the escalation of aggression  military attacks and other actions against Nicaragua's sovereignty  political Independence  territorial integrity ..."" (A/41/697  p. 104) or that of other States of the region. In this context  it is more than ever necessary to stress that it is incumbent on all of us to follow with interest and to support the Contadora Group and the Support Group  in view of the praiseworthy efforts that they have been making recently to promote peace.As we know  these efforts led to the adoption last August in Guatemala City of a peace plan which was accepted by all the parties concerned. In many respects it offers a real chance of resolving the misunderstandings that exist or might exist between States in the subregion. We trust that all other States will refrain from actions that might interfere with this peace process. In South-East Asia  regarding Kampuchea  we venture to hope that the agreement signed on 29 July 1987 between the Vietnamese Foreign Minister  representing the countries of Indo-China  and the Indonesian Foreign Minister  representing the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  will be mutually respected  in the interests of the peoples of that part of Asia.Today  all observers agree that there is some evolution in the situation in Afghanistan and that the various parties concerned seem to agree on a fair number of issues. Naturally  therefore  we support the efforts of the Secretary-General with a view to the settlement of the problem in the Interests of the Afghan people as a whole.In the Korean peninsula the concentration of large armed forces along the military demarcation line clearly constitutes a threat to peace and security. In order to ease the tensions and help to speed up the peaceful reunification of the peninsula  a number of initiatives have been taken to reduce the armed forces there. The response to those initiatives and others and the interest evinced throughout the world are encouraging signs of good will favourable to the restoration of peace and security in that area  and thus worthy of the attention of this Assembly.Continuing tension and insecurity are features of the situation in the Middle East  which continues to be a matter of concern to the international community. For several years now the General Assembly has been seized of the Middle East crisis without there being any glimmer of a real settlement.As was reaffirmed by the General Assembly in its resolution 41/162 A  adopted on 4 December 1986: ""a Just and comprehensive settlement of the situation in the Middle East cannot be achieved without the participation on an equal footing of all the parties to the conflict  including the Palestine Liberation Organization ...” The international community's support for the convening of a conference on peace in the Middle East gives ground for great hope  in our opinion. We trust that all interested parties will refrain from imposing pre-conditions that might delay the convening of such a conference and that they will be able to take up the substantive problem  namely  peace in the Middle East and self-determination for the Palestinian people.The Iran-Iraq war and the tense situation in the Gulf have had disastrous consequences to date for the people themselves and for the economies of the two warring parties  seriously threatening international security. In associating ourselves with the initiatives recently taken by the Security Council  through the adoption of resolution 598 (1987)  Congo appeals to the two parties to end the conflict. We support the diplomatic activity of the Secretary-General in this connection  and call on all States to refrain from any interference or action that might hamper the efforts under way  pursuant to paragraph 5 of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).As for Chad  a neighbour and brother of Congo  we note with satisfaction the progress made in the process of national reconciliation. However  there remain other problems.The Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAŪ)   which is meeting now in Lusaka  Zambia  under the presidency of El Had j Omar Bongo  President of the Republic of Gabon  is trying to settle the Chad-Libya border dispute. We firmly support those mediation efforts  in which Congo has always been actively involved.Today  by general agreement  the question of Western Sahara seems to be at a deadlock. This is particularly deplorable in that we know - because we were closely involved in this - that the Chairman of the OAU and the Secretary—General of the United Nations have made intensive efforts to bring about a lasting solution. The active co-operation of all the parties concerned remains indispensable to the success of the joint actions of the OAU and the United Nations  as set forth in the relevant resolutions adopted by those two Organizations.Africa is being eaten away by the gangrene of apartheid  one of the moat shocking anachronisms of our century. Despite many appeals and threats  most of the people of South Africa continue to live in a permanent state of siege; Nelson Mandela is still in prison and along with him are many political prisoners who have been arbitrarily detained. The destabilization of the front-line States has not stopped.Until the apartheid system is dismantled - a system which has been declared here to be ""a crime against humanity"" - there are no grounds for south Africa's joining the ranks of free Africa or of the international community. Thus  we shall continue to call for decisive measures against the Pretoria regime as demanded by the South African tragedy and the growing impatience of the international community.On 10 November 1986 the General Assembly adopted resolution 41/35 B  reaffirming its support for the struggle of the people of South Africa and condemning the activities of trans national corporations and financial institutions that have continued to co-operate with that country.South Africa  which incidentally is tranquilly building up a military force which is a threat to the peace and security of the continent  has continued for eight years to reject with impunity the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which was designed to facilitate Namibia's accession to Independence. To preserve the credibility of the United Nations  the Security Council  which last July adopted an important decision on the question of the Gulf war  indicating in particular that there was a possibility of recourse to Chapter VII of the Charter  will  we feel sure  be consistent in its actions and consider tackling the same firm attitude with regard to South Africa to ensure the application of a decision that was adopted unanimously and whose application is therefore mandatory. I refer to resolution 435 (1978)  paced with this situation  Africa has outlined new approaches  committed more resources  mobilized further energies. The success of the Africa Fund is but one illustration  judging by the significant contributions made to it from the Congo - 200 million CPA francs - and from Africa and elsewhere for a total of $US 110 million as of 25 May 1987.jBrazzaville  the capital of the Congo  this year hosted historic meetings for the continent  including  inter-alia  an international symposium in May 1987 on the topic ""Writers condemn apartheid""  in which 400 representatives from various countries and international organizations participated; and the First Congress of Scientists in Africa  held from 25 to 30 June 1987  which  in the view of the scientists themselves  was a great success.At the end of that Congress  a non-governmental organization called Pan African Union of Science and Technology was founded  with Brazzaville as its headquarters  the Congolese Government is donating a large building and a grant of 50 million CFA francs - that is $US 150 000 - for the new organization.In addition  the Organization of African Unity has declared 30 June African Scientific Renaissance Day to be observed yearly.Thus for the first time in Africa the awareness and creativity of scientists and researchers has been called upon so as to benefit from their contribution to the liberation and advancement of the continent.As President Denis Sassou-Nguesso said here last year ""Africa is aware of the vital nature of what is at stake  namely  mastery of both sciences and adopted techniques ... which are the real key to tomorrow's world. Africa does not wish to and cannot fail in that under taking."" (A/41/PV. 17> p¿ 17) When in the first half of this year President Denis Sassou-Nguesso visited various capitals of the world - after having visited North Africa last year - he was able to gauge the degree of understanding and mobilization of public opinion in those countries and the positions of their Governments vis-à-vis Africa. There were some signs of hope which deserved to be reflected in the efforts and mobilization of the African countries. That this is what we wanted to see real commitments by Africa's partners in implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African economic recovery.The best we can say today is that several International agencies have already taken certain measures aimed at starting the implementation of the Programme of Action; similarly  recently at Venice the summit meeting of the seven most industrialized Western Powers recognized the need to increase official development aid to Africa as well as the particularly distressing situation of Africa's debt.In any event  a global assessment of the implementation of the Programme will take place only next year. However  we wish here once again to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  whose interim report indicates the efforts he has made towards the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for Africa.In dealing with questions of survival and development in Africa  we are getting into an area where there is a very deeply felt common concern on the part of all developing countries  as was demonstrated last July at UNCTAD VII.Indeed  for a decade now - if not longer - most developing countries have adopted reform and readjustment policies whose effects have turned out to be as uncertain as the situations they were designed to correct.Illusions about what could be achieved from the sacrifices undertaken by the poor peoples have been commensurate with the uncertainty in which the international climate is floundering. Split between the virtues of callous selfishness and professions of faith in a liberalism that would bring salvation  many developed countries have in fact been busy destroying their own reference system instead of giving it the credibility to which they invite the developing countries.Hence  instead of market laws  we have protectionism  overpricing of manufactured goods and quasi-dogmatic under-pricing of commodities. What is more  repayment of debt is seen as the sacred duty of the debtor country  under pain of the harshest economic sanctions regardless of ability to pay.On the other hand  there is extreme distrust of the idea of reorganizing the machinery of international trade and the transfer of resources  at a time when the exchange rates of the main currencies are out of control and interest rates are indeed at extremely high levels.Debates at UNCTAD VII once again revealed these shortcomings of the international economic system. The matter of the entry into force of the agreement on establishing the Common Fund for commodities  which had been so often been postponed  alone reflects the reality of the tragedy of those countries - and their region - whose resources basically come from the sale of commodities.Like most developing countries  the People's Republic of the Congo now finds itself faced with all these problems  aggravated as they are by trends which are hardly propitious to promoting growth in the developing countries. However  co-operation between my country and international agencies  on the one hand  and with other partners at the bilateral level  on the other  has never been ambiguous  for loyalty and mutual interest of the partners have always been the basic elements of that co-operation.It is essential that these elements be preserved; there is nothing more absurd  an seeing countries that are rigorously and in good faith applying adjustment policies being at times forced into a kind of rebellion against the basically unfair rules of the game A few weeks ago in New York the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was convened. It had the merit of highlighting the incalculable risks in the uncurbed use of resources for death rather than for life.The Congolese delegation welcomes the adoption by consensus of the Final Document by that Conference. Of course the document did not live up to everyone's hopes  nor did it meet all concerns. It covers up the concerns that were hardly concealed in originally polarized positions  some of which were brought closer only at the cost of numerous concessions  that even at times sacrificed the very objectives of the Conference. But the very contents of the document must be characterized as a highly political act because  far from simply limiting itself to historical reality  the document establishes the basis for a process which must be continued and strengthened with real political will so as to achieve the objectives of disarmament and development as set forth in the Charter.That consensus  together with the Final Act of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  constitutes an act of faith in multilateralism as an instrument on which international co-operation must be based.It is in the same spirit that we must hail the agreement in principle arrived at just a few days ago between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on medium- and short-range missiles. We venture to hope that that opening will strengthen the current trend towards the objective of disarmament.In a world which in the final analysis is governed by imperatives as questionable as those of the manufacture and sale of increasingly costly weapons to countries daily engulfed and consumed by emotion and distrust  there is very little margin for peace and security. But this pessimism in no way implies despair. Our presence here at the United Nations is  after all  testimony to the resurgence of which the human spirit is always capable.It is for us all  the men and women of today  who are building our own future  to try to build a new world - and it is to that that the People's Republic of the Congo  for its part  has decided fully to commit itself."
"31",1522,"COL",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  on behalf of my country  Colombia  one of the oldest and most robust democracies on earth  I wish to congratulate you on the honour conferred on you  which is no more than the recognition due to your eminent personal and intellectual gifts.The Assembly  as it convenes at its forty-second session  is an affirmation once again of the vital importance of coexistence as a binding force among sovereign nations. This league of States in voluntary association has demonstrated that there is a minimum set of common rules for the harmonious regulation of their relations  and that the foundation for such regulation is to be found in international law.Among the concerns being debated by the international community there are three central elements which most urgently demand concerted action. I refer to peace  out overriding aspiration  and hand in hand with it  the concept of human dignity and the need for a just and equitable international order.Colombia  which was well represented in the League of Nations and is a founding Member of the United Nations  has always endeavoured to model its international policy on these principles  and has striven for the necessary coherence between foreign affairs and domestic policy.I wish today to reaffirm before the world Colombia's unwavering commitment to peace. Its armies have never crossed the borders of their homeland except to contribute with their blood to the great work of liberation undertaken by the heroes of the independence of the Americas or  in response to an appeal from this Organization or friendly countries  to help by their presence to preserve peace and democracy. This line of conduct will not change. We shall remain committed to the objective of striving together for prosperity  development and peace. We strongly repudiate the arms race mentality  not only the kind that means rushing headlong towards world confrontation and nuclear annihilation  but also that of some States which  in spite of the enormous economic and social difficulties they face  employ force or coercion in an attempt to advance claims which  if valid  should be settled by means of peaceful solutions based on the rule of law.It is for this reason that my country firmly supports the affirmation by the Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament  and Development of the need to check the unbridled expansion of the arms race  the heavy economic cost of which has to be met by diverting resources that could be used to eliminate the inequalities that undermine the stability of societies. The Assembly should continue to study measures directed towards effective disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons  which today jeopardize the very survival of mankind.My country sees an encouraging sign for mankind as a whole in the coming together of the great nuclear Powers and the success that they are achieving in their negotiations  and hopes that the prospects of death and destruction through armed conflict may be averted once and for all.We endorse most firmly and resolutely the solution of disputes by peaceful means  including recourse to conciliation  arbitration and judicial settlement  especially when extremely lengthy direct negotiations fail to result in agreement. The international community may rest assured that Colombia  adhering faithfully to the principles which have guided its international policy  will not resort to force to resolve any differences with other States. Happily for the Americas and for world peace  recently there have been signs of hope for a solution to the Central American conflict  following the agreements arrived at in Guatemala by the five Central American Presidents and the establishment of the International Verification and Follow-up Commission  made up of the Foreign Ministers of the Contadora Group  the Support Group and Central America together with the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. Similarly encouraging are the first steps taken towards devising an emergency plan of technical and economic co-operation for Central America. It is clear that the regional conflict is caused to a large extent by economic and social problems which it is essential that we overcome. The time has come for all the parties concerned  with the vital co-operation of countries having ties or interests in the region  to establish lasting peace.My country  together with the other States of the Contadora Group and the Support Group  will spare no effort to promote this goal  for peace in Central America is also our peace.We welcome the effective work being done by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and his representatives in all those parts of the world where conflicts have arisen  in the diligent fulfilment of the responsibilities for the preservation of international peace and security laid down in the Charter. We hope to be able to continue to rely at all times on the Secretary-General's constant and effective co-operation.Colombia is a whole-hearted believer in dialogue and wishes the dialogue in the Korean peninsula to be reopened as promptly as possible with a view to bringing about peaceful reunification. We also hope that dialogue will continue to be a useful implement in the negotiations on the question of the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands  in keeping with the spirit of the resolution of which we were a sponsor at the last session of the Assembly.The Government of Colombia is convinced that respect for and the promotion of human rights go beyond mere exercises in rhetoric in international forums. They are a moral obligation borne by all States that must be faithfully fulfilled in all its aspects  ranging from the treatment accorded to minorities settled within a country's own territory to truly authentic freedom of expression.It should be kept in mind that the peoples of the developing world have yet to attain the minimum conditions for well-being; the benefits of health care  proper nutrition  housing  education and employment  as the necessary foundation for individual freedoms. Prevision for these needs  truly the bedrock of democracy  is bound up on the world level with the establishment of a mote just international economic order based on co-operation among States.Although my country is not as hard-pressed as other sister nations in Latin America by the problem of the repayment of external debt  we should not lose sight of the fact that this is a problem which  if not adequately resolved  will bring social disorder and oppression in its wake. Colombia has participated with interest in many international forums in discussion of the world financial problem. We particularly welcomed the consensus achieved at the last session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). We hope that the Assembly will make further progress on this matter. Today more than ever before the community of nations is duty-bound to take a joint approach to problems which cannot be tackled otherwise than in a global manner. I am thinking especially of the phenomenon of narcotic drug trafficking  which has exacted a heavy toll in pain and blood from my country. Colombia remains steadfast in its battle against that problem  as it reaffirmed in Vienna at the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.This crusade  affecting as it does the whole of mankind  cannot be an isolated one; nor can it be carried out successfully by a single country or group of countries. Concerted international action is necessary to tackle the problem in its entirety and in its various phases of production  consumption and control of the financial resources stemming from this destructive traffic.In this regard  we recognize the importance of the efforts of the United Nations and  in particular  of the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control.Addressing this Assembly a year ago the Colombian Head of State spoke of the urgent need for concerted action to combat the extreme poverty which afflicts vast sections of the earth's population. In response to that appeal  the United Nations Development Programme has been engaged in effective work in Latin America  with the initiation of the regional project designed to foster and provide advisory services for programmes to assist the marginalized sectors of our continent. Many countries of the region are now benefiting from this support. Colombia has resolved to take up as a national priority the challenge of eradicating poverty  while at the same time working for concerted action on the international level to combat this scourge. It has offered to host a regional conference on the question  with the support of the united Nations Development Programme and the participation and backing of the Latin American community  which shares Colombia's anguish over the plight of the marginalized populations.Colombia looks forward with optimism to the results of the debate in the Assembly on the recommendations contained in the report  entitled ""Our Common Future""  of the Commission of eminent persons presided over by the Prime Minister of Norway  Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland. It is evident that the future of this earth is closely tied to the success we achieve in confronting the challenges involved in managing the environment.My country hopes that the ideals of harmonious coexistence  human dignity and international co-operation will be reinforced during these deliberations by the political will of the States represented in the Assembly and that the pact among nations may be translated into reality through the establishment of an order of equity and peace for all peoples  based on the full effectiveness of the principles of international law and the lofty values which are the underpinning of the Chatter of our world Organization."
"32",1563,"COM",42,1987,"﻿I should like first to convey to Mr. Peter Florin  on behalf of my delegation  sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. His qualities as an experienced diplomat  coupled with his great experience of our Organization  and the high offices that he has occupied in his country are a sure guarantee of the successful conduct of our work at a time when the Assembly must once again discuss serious problems which threaten the balance of our planet. We wish him every success in carrying out his difficult duties.I should like also to congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  a sister Muslim country whose dedication  authority and ability made calm  positive work possible at the last session.I take this opportunity also to pay a special tribute once again to the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his persistent efforts in the service of world peace. I associate in these congratulations Mr. Joseph Reed  who was recently nominated to the post of Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs. My delegation is convinced that the great qualities that distinguish that eminent diplomat will make him an effective member of the Secretary-General's new team.Two years after the historic celebration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization we must say that  despite the cries of alarm heard on that occasion  and despite our aspirations to a better world  the threat to international peace and security is greater than ever before. Indeed  in the light of the persistent conflicts and the sporadic wars which could at any time degenerate into a general conflagration  the peoples of the earth have never felt with such anguish the daily threat that endangers their very existence.We are concerned at the increasing difficulties facing our Organization  given the many challenges that beset mankind. Urgent measures are necessary to ensure that the sacred principles of the Charter of our Organization are respected and applied. The United Nations is the universal symbol of justice  equality and peace. It is a moral bulwark which has frequently enabled our world to escape the worst that could happen. That is why we must understand the primary  decisive role that it must continue to play. It is time to re-establish its credibility  because millions of people pin their hopes on it. However  to ensure that the community of nations can continue to shoulder its great responsibilities effectively  a new mentality  based on mutual understanding and respect  must predominate in international relations.Like the gloomy political situation that characterizes international relations at present  the rather poor economic situation is of great concern. This session is taking place two months after the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held in Geneva in July. The reasonably positive results that emerged from that Conference reflect a certain change in the positions until then adopted by the developed countries of the North  although by no means all obstacles have been overcome - far from it.It goes without saying that the recovery that has started in the North has become a great problem for the developing countries of the South and proves that partial  unilateral solutions adopted by the wealthy countries to resolve structural problems are inadequate. The crisis continues  and my country  which is one of the least developed  increasingly feels the damaging effects of this. These effects include: disorganization of the international economic system; a great increase in the debt burden as compared with the developing countries' repayment capacity; a sharp fall in the prices of raw materials; the continued worsening of the already catastrophic situation of the least developed countries and so on.Because mine is an island country  because of our restricted national territory  part of which is still under foreign occupation  and because we lack mining resources  the development process embarked upon after our independence by the Comorian Government  under the enlightened guidance of Mr  Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane  President of the Republic  continues to face major obstacles. We would note in particular the following the fact that the prices of our commodities  which account for more than 90 per cent of the value of our exports  have gone down; the fact that the volume of our debt servicing has increased by two and a half times in less than three years; the intransigence of our creditors with regard to the unfavourable conditions of their loans; the reduction in absolute terms of export earnings; the failure by some of our partners to respect commitments to assist our country that were undertaken at the first round table of donors  organized in Moroni  our capital  in July 19B4.Despite these many constraints  my Government continues to make great efforts to support growth and improve the living standards of our people. Thus  beginning in 1979  a restructuring programme relating particularly to production sectors has been undertaken. these efforts have been accompanied by a series of measures to improve financing in the public and para-public sectors  enabling us better to rationalize State operations and support growth by promoting private initiatives and very productive endeavours. This economic recovery policy had led to much improved performance in some areas by 1983. In fact  thanks to the multiplying effects of this programme  throughout this period we have seen an overall growth in the economy of 6 per cent per annum and an annual increase of 1.7 per cent of real income per inhabitant. Nevertheless  the worsening of the international environment  marked by a sharp drop in commodity prices  and the great increase in debt servicing brought about by the excessive increase in interest rates in the main currencies used in the credit market have wiped out these endogenous efforts.Our Government  for its part  is firmly committed to the spirit of enterprise and is determined to continue the battle against underdevelopment. However  without sustained increased aid from the international community  our country will not be able to reach its goals. That is why I now appeal to all people of goodwill to demonstrate  in keeping with the relevant resolutions of our Organization  their active solidarity by giving us their valuable assistance.In the light of the complexity of the problems that confront our States  regional and sub regional grouping is one of the ways to reduce these difficulties. That is certainly true for my country  and it is one of the priorities of its foreign policy. That is why my Government is committed to promoting regional and sub regional co-operation. Comoros was one of the founding members of the Preferential Trade Zone  incorporating countries of eastern Africa  southern Africa and the Indian Ocean. But it is thanks to the establishment in 1984 of the Indian Ocean Commission  which includes Madagascar  Mauritius  Seychelles  Reunion Island and Comoros  that our various peoples can now pin real hopes on the advent of a common sub regional market. The Indian Ocean Commission  over which my country has the honour of presiding  gives the inhabitants of the area a chance to create a new economic area capable of providing for the harmonious  integrated  long-term development of our subregion. But despite our determination  because of its paltry means the Indian Ocean Commission will not be able  without significant aid  to become the indispensable tool for the growth of our economies.Apart from the generous and greatly appreciated aid given by the Commission of European Communities  no other assistance has been forthcoming to support our sub regional co-operation. Therefore  as current Chairman of the Indian Ocean Commission  I would appeal for the assistance of the international community and ask it to take an active part in financing the projects included in our programme.Allow me now briefly to assess the international political situation.In the Middle East  Israel continues its aggression against the Arab peoples The Zionist entity refuses to accept the reality of the Palestinian people as a nation and seeks to flout its inalienable rights  with the assistance of its allies  Israel is pursuing an aggressive expansionist policy and has rejected the peaceful solutions proposed thus far.We have always supported and affirmed the view that there can be no lasting  true peace in the Middle East as long as the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are not recognized  guaranteed and effectively exercised. That is why the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros supports the idea of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned  including  of course  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole  authentic  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.A corollary of the Israeli-Arab conflict  the situation in Lebanon is still marked by daily violence and suffering  to which now has been added the spectre of famine and the situation is aggravated by the permanent presence of the Zionist army of occupation.After seven years of deadly hostilities that have brought about a situation in which there can be no victors and no vanquished  the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq continues its rampage in those countries. The increased risk of this conflict becoming international requires increasing vigilance by the international community. That is why we welcome the efforts of our Organization  more specifically the Secretary-General. The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros supports Security Council resolution 598 (1987) calling for an immediate cease-fire by the two warring parties. We once again appeal to them  and particularly to Iran  strictly to abide by the Security Council resolution and all the efforts made thus far to achieve the cessation of hostilities and to put an end to this war  which is both absurd and futile.Despite the resistance and bravery of the Afghan people  Afghanistan continues to suffer massacres and destruction in an undeclared war imposed upon it by a foreign Power. We have been following with keen interest the mediation efforts conducted under the auspices of the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General  but we remain deeply concerned about the continuance of this war that has already inflicted great losses on the people of that country. My country unreservedly supports the heroic struggle of that fraternal people  and we call for the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces in accordance with the relevant resolutions of our Organization.Turning to Kampuchea  that country continues to be beset by foreign military occupation  notwithstanding the resolutions of the General Assembly calling for the immediate  unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops. The suffering people of Kampuchea is entitled to choose for itself  in full freedom and without any external constraints  the kind of government it wants.The situation in the Korean peninsula remains at a standstill. Despite the statement by the two States in the North and the South on reaching an agreement  no decisive step has yet been taken towards peaceful reunification of the country. We exhort the two parties to continue to try to find a just and lasting solution to the problem  because a United Korea would be a guarantee for peace and stability In that region. We reaffirm that the admission to membership of the two Koreas in our Organization would help to promote a speedy settlement of the problem.In southern Africa  despite the repeated condemnations voiced by the international community  the Pretoria regime is still maintaining its inhuman policy of apartheid. This region is still the theatre of grave events that have brought about an explosive situation  thus imperilling the political stability of the countries of the region. We strongly condemn the continuing inhuman system of apartheid and sincerely call for abolition of that policy  which alone can help restore civil peace in the country and stability in that part of our continent.We note with regret that Namibia still has not regained its independence  despite the relevant resolutions of our Organization. Faithful to the principles of peace and freedom  the Comorian Government is convinced that implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) alone will make possible a peaceful  negotiated settlement of this problem.The situation on the Chadian-Libyan border calls for special attention. While welcoming the cease-fire  although it is fragile  between Chad and Libya  my country is very concerned about this dispute between two African countries  both members of the Organization of African unity (OAU) and the Islamic Conference.In our view  the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the charter of the OAU require that any dispute should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation. We therefore make a solemn appeal to the two parties concerned to embark upon the course of dialogue  mutual understanding and good-neighbourliness to resolve their conflict. The interests of their respective peoples are at stake  as well as the dignity of Africa and the unity of our pan-African organization.Turning to Western Sahara  my country reiterates that it fully supports the resolutions adopted at the 18th and 19th summit meetings of the OAU. We are convinced that to secure a satisfactory and lasting solution to this problem a referendum must be organized to enable the people concerned to exercise their right to self-determination. We call upon the parties concerned to make use  under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the current Chairman of the OAU  of all the peaceful means at their disposal and to demonstrate wisdom and the will to attain that goal.My country  like all the other littoral States of the Indian Ocean  is concerned by the increasing reinforcement of the military presence in that region  which has been made more serious by the explosive situation in the Arab-Persian Gulf. In its desire to preserve peace and security in that area  my country has always fought for the establishment of a zone of peace  a demilitarised  denuclearised zone in the Indian Ocean  in keeping with the Declaration contained in General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI).Before concluding this brief review of the international situation  I wish to refer once again to a question familiar to our Organization that is a source of serious concern for my country. I mean  of course  the question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte.As the Assembly knows  this problem arose from an injustice and a flagrant violation of public international law  and has a permanent place on the agendas of all international and regional organizations. Unfortunately  no just  lasting solution has been found  and this year again there will be a special discussion 01 this matter which will give us opportunity to go into more detail on it. For the time being  I would merely state that there have been no developments since the forty-first session of the General Assembly because nothing has happened to give the matter a fresh impetus.Yet  after the meeting between the delegation of the OAU and the French Prime Minister  Mr. Jacques Chirac  in June 1986  and the encouraging statements h the latter  everyone felt that something positive would finally emerge. I would recall  however  that  following that meeting and the subsequent meetings between President Abderemane and the highest French authorities  the French Government decided to withdraw from the French Parliament the Bill on the organization of a referendum in Mayotte. Finally  the French Prime Minister paid a brief visit to the Comoros in October 1986. But the situation that prevails there has not lived up to the hopes raised by all these initiatives.Nevertheless  my Government  convinced of the justice of its cause  has not ceased its efforts to continue to assert its most legitimate rights both in international forums and at the bilateral level.Every time this question is discussed by the international community there is unanimous condemnation of this injustice and people always say that Mayotte is an integral part of the Islamic Federal Republic of Comoros.I reaffirm once again from this rostrum that the people and Government  of Comoros  because of their right and the unanimous support of the international community  are determined to fight until their just cause triumphs.We therefore make an urgent  solemn appeal to the French Government to take a decisive step  within the framework of the friendly relations that exist between our two countries  to make possible a final solution to this distressing problem. In conclusion  I reaffirm my Government's unswerving commitment to the United Nations system and its ideals and noble objectives."
"33",1602,"CPV",42,1987,"﻿We should like first of all  Sir  to say how pleased we were to welcome your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that your personal qualifications and professional experience will contribute to proper consideration of the complex issues which the General Assembly must tackle at this session.We also congratulate the President of the last session  Mr. Choudhury  on his invaluable contribution to the work on important issues during his term of office We take pleasure  in particular  in expressing our appreciation of and gratitude for the serious and responsible manner in which he directed delicate negotiation; in difficult circumstances in the life of the United Nations.We reiterate our confidence in the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and thank him for the work he has done and for the prompt  resolute and intelligent action that has characterized his administration. At difficult periods in the life of the Organization  Mr. Perez de Cuellar's efforts to preserve this essential international forum have been truly valuable.Every year since the Republic of Cape Verde became independent we have addressed the General Assembly to express the views of our country and its Government on the international political situation and make our modest but committed contribution to the collective analysis of the questions affecting the community of nations.Throughout all these years we have particularly appreciated the achievements of the international community that have contributed to the progress  dignity a 3 well-being of peoples. We have stressed with concern the negative factors and he demonstrations of force still in evidence in international conduct  sacrificing lives on the altar of violence or hunger  destroying homes and hopes and sowing or Increasing injustice  poverty and desolation. We have put forward suggestions and ideas in keeping with the feelings of the overwhelming majority of other countries represented here in an attempt to contribute in some way to the search for joint solutions to the problems that scourge us and hamper the creation of a better  more just world.In spite of some encouraging signs  the international situation continues basically to be as complex as ever·  certain matters and problems confronting the international community have grown graver. We still see the systematic use or threat of use of force in relations among States and the denial of the fundamental rights of peoples still under the yoke of colonial domination or the victims of racism. Moreover  poverty/ hunger  the deterioration of the environment  desertification and natural disasters and their harmful consequences strike millions of human beings with increasing intensity.Every year crucial and less crucial problems are discussed in depth by distinguished speakers who  on behalf of their respective countries  express here their concern at the current situation  analyse the problems and make recommendations for their rapid and satisfactory solution. The well-being and happiness of mankind constitute the goal put forward by all.Everyone agrees that justice  dignity and respect for law are factors to guide the action of States in their task of building a better and more balanced world in which dialogue would replace intolerance  in which co-operation and human solidarity would triumph over narrow-minded nationalism  and in which joint solutions would prevail. But that concern  which is universal among statesmen and politicians the world over  has not been followed up with actions and measures for the effective solution of the global problems of our day. In the final analysis  we are frustrated at our collective inability to resolve effectively the questions affecting the entire international community. That frustration is all the greater because of our knowledge that we now possess the means to resolve these problems.Respect for the principles and attainment of the purposes set out in the Charter of the United Nations neatly half a century ago demands the firm and unequivocal commitment of us all to the enlightened humanistic vision of those who  having experienced the harmful and destructive effects of heightened nationalism  decided to lay the foundation of a new era in the history of relations among nations  based on peace  co-operation  justice and dignity for all.The Republic of Cape Verde advocates universal dialogue and solidarity in relations between States  and firmly believes that political resolve and respect for law in international relations can help build the world so long awaited by our peoples. Independence of thought and action  freedom of choice and autonomy in decision-making - in a word  independence - are thus historical requirements.In keeping with that deep conviction  we ate striving at home to promote the development and well-being of our people  at the same time strengthening the climate of peace and trust in which we live.In our region  we highlight among our immediate goals that of contributing to a valid solution to the conflict in southern Africa and that of resolving the economic crisis that is stifling the continent. These are two of the major obstacles to the liberation and progress of Africa.In the United Nations we try to co-operate with all other Member States in the international atmosphere conducive to the preservation and strengthening of international stability and security. In that context  we follow with concern the armed conflicts that continue to sow disarray and desolation in several parts of the world·  these conflicts are true hindrances to human development and progress. From Central America to Asia  from the Persian Gulf to southern Africa  every day we feel the climate of tension and destruction in those regions. There are other disputes whose persistence harshly punishes the affected populations. For decades  the apartheid system has unquestionably been the greatest cause for instability in Africa. Because of its very nature  its persistence and the widening contradictions within it  that system of ongoing institutionalised violence  maintained at the cost of repression and ignominy  can only render the situation even more explosive. The bloody events of recent years testify to the fact that the apartheid regime has reached the boiling point.We are convinced that the present situation requites fundamental changes  not mere temporary changes or changes rendered obsolete by the internal political situation. Changes of that nature have not broken the resolve of the majority of the population of South Africa in its irreversible and legitimate struggle for dignity  justice and equality. Thus  a just and lasting solution cannot be found until the apartheid system is rooted out  yielding to  another society in which all South Africans will enjoy the same rights and the respect due to every human being  irrespective of social origin or colour. The eradication of apartheid is therefore not only a moral imperative for all mankind  but a political necessity for peace and development throughout  the region.The Pretoria regime is also a threat to the peoples and countries of southernAfrica  whose security  stability and well-being continue to be systematically disturbed either through direct military intervention or through the intermediary of armed bands trained  financed and directed by that regime for carrying out obviously terrorist activities such as the recent massacre at Homoine in the People’s Republic of Mozambique·The enormous damage the war has caused in the front-line countries  especially the People's Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique  and the constant manoeuvres of political and military destabilization against those countries by South Africa gravely jeopardize their economic development and seriously damage the progress and social well-being of the affected populations. In this context it is urgent to increase assistance to the front-line countries. We continue to believe that the international community can and must adopt effective measures against the Pretoria regime. It is within this framework that we welcome with optimism the recent proposals by the People's Republic of Angola  which  in their flexibility and scope  demonstrate once again the openness and political will of the Angolan authorities to arrive at a peaceful solution in the region. We reiterate  however  our belief that the international community can and must adopt effective measures against the Pretoria regime for the urgent elimination of the system of apartheid  and thus contribute to a peaceful transition towards a multiracial society and ensure a future of dignity for all the peoples and countries of the region.The situation in Namibia constitutes a hotbed of tension in the southern part of the continent as South Africa persists in its illegal occupation of the Territory despite the repeated condemnations of the international community and the decisions of the United Nations.We believe the Territory's independence must be achieved on an urgent basis through strict implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).In Chad and in Western Sahara  conflicts persist for which solutions must be found on the basis of dialogue and the relevant decisions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  in this connection we wish to stress the importance of the initiatives undertaken by the OAU's ad hoc committee on the situation in Chad  as well as the joint initiatives of the United Nations Secretary-General and the President of the OAU with a view to a negotiated solution to the conflict in Western Sahara.In the Middle East  the injustice confronting the Palestinian people persists. Those of us who at some time in our history have been victims of colonial violence or of the humiliation of foreign occupation know the real dimensions of the suffering that people has faced over the past four decades. Massacres and mass violations of human rights committed against the people of Palestine  as well as the continued denial of their right to form their own sovereign State  certainly do not promote an atmosphere of peace in the Middle East  a region where political and military stability cannot be achieved without a solution to the Palestinian question.In this context  the international conference on peace in the Middle East  with the presence of all parties concerned  which has been approved by the General Assembly  seems to us an excellent framework for the search for a peaceful solution for the region  Efforts to achieve its convening must therefore be continued.In the Gulf region we are witnessing with concern the armed conflict between the fraternal peoples of Iran and Iraq. That conflict  which has in recent years assumed alarming proportions and caused immense suffering and damage to the population  is now becoming internationalised and is thus seriously endangering peace not only in the region but throughout the world. We reiterate our urgent appeal to the two parties to put an end to their hostilities and to seek a negotiated solution.The recent Security Council resolution on a cease—fire was the result of long and careful thought and awareness of the dangers to the world inherent in the conflict  it is to be hoped that in the serious and highly sensitive situation now prevailing in the region the military forces there will demonstrate restraint. The common sense essential to the establishment of an atmosphere of détente and dialogue must replace force and attempts to use force.The territory of East Timor remains illegally occupied by foreign forces  which denies the Maubere people its legitimate and inalienable right to self-determination and independence. We appeal to the international community and help them in their efforts to establish the conditions necessary for the people of East Timor to exercise its inalienable right to choose its own destiny. The process of decolonisation  one ofthe important and noble achievements in the annals of our Organization  will not becomplete as long as East Timor and other territories remain under the yoke of foreign occupation.We are following the events in Central America with utmost attention. The violence that has prevailed in the region in recent years has demonstrated the need to take urgent measures to establish a climate conducive to the realization of the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the region to peace and social justice. We greatly appreciate the efforts made by the Heads of State of the region that have led to the adoption of an agreement on the establishment of lasting peace in Central America. We are convinced that if that agreement is implemented by all the parties and respected by all States it will certainly help to bring peace to our Latin American brothers of the region.In South-East Asia  we regret that the initiatives and efforts made thus far have not succeeded as we had hoped  in decreasing tension and bringing about respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of all the States of the region  including Kampuchea. It is high time for a solution to be found to the situation in that country. It is time for the Kampuchean people  free of foreign interference and in full freedom  to decide their own destiny.We remain firmly convinced that in Korea dialogue and co-operation between the two parties are prerequisites for the happiness  well-being and progress of the Korean people and the peaceful reunification of their homeland. We are following with great interest diplomatic initiatives towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan. We encourage any solution that respects that country's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity# as well as its non-aligned status  and the right of the Afghan people to choose their destiny without foreign interference and in freedom.While armed conflicts and tension in international relations still characterize the international political situation/ the deterioration of the economic situation prevailing in many third-world countries seriously endangers the survival and well-being of their peoples.  The foreign debt  which has now reached proportions that have disastrous effects mainly African and Latin American economies  the stagnation in official development aid and investments in the developing countries  and the decline - sometimes staggering - in the prices of raw materials on the international market: all those elements have contributed to the difficult economic situation in those countries.For many years the majority of States have been repeatedly stating that substantive change in international economic relations is the only way to resolve the economic crisis  which has particularly affected the African countries. The economy of the African countries south of the Sahara over the past 10 years has suffered the negative effects of the adverse trends in the terms of trade and the disturbances caused by external factors familiar to everyone. In this context  they have also suffered the negative effects of the increasing difficulty faced by those countries in attracting capital from the industrialized world  as well as the growth of the debt-servicing burden to unbearable proportions.The economic difficulties of the continent now have devastating social impacts. Thus  the decline in food production has caused a great  increase in malnourishment among the peoples.It is in that economic context that Africa has confronted the worst drought of this century. That drought has already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of persons. The international community has generally recognized that the drought in Africa has caused great hunger. It has reacted by adopting a number of temporary measures but  since they are temporary  they do not meet the development needs. Hence  it is necessary to tackle the problem by structural methods that can reverse the present trends.Africa today is examining all the problems related to its development. This question has been increasingly at the centre of our concerns and thoughts in recent years. The Monrovia Colloquium  the Lagos Summit and the twenty-second Summit Conference of the Organization of African Unity in Addis Ababa  inter alia  have been significant forums for deeper reflection about the problem.There is an ever-increasing awareness among Africans of the need for a new dynamic of regional integration and self-focused development geared towards the realization of the vast potentials of our continent and the constant improvement c the well-being of the African peoples. We are aware that the problems of development are complex  that their solutions are difficult and that the energies and resources required are vast. We are also aware that in the process of the region's development the driving force must basically be the Africans themselves. But they will confront difficulties and their efforts will be seriously compromised if they are not supported by international co-operation and by significant  diversified external assistance. In fact  the ever-increasing interdependence of today's world makes a region's development difficult without the interaction resulting from co-operation with other regions. We are deeply convinced that a peaceful solution to the conflict in Southern Africa would give a new dimension to the legitimate aspirations of the African people in the North and the South of the continent. We are deeply convinced  furthermore  that economic  technical and financial co-operation between a South Africa freed of racism - a democratic South Africa - and the other African countries would enormously benefit the development of the entire region. At a time when hundreds of thousands of human beings are dying of hunger in Africa and in other parts of our planet  we are witnessing a proliferation of weapons which consumes vast human and material resources and threatens the very survival of mankind. The recent Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development demonstrated the impact on developing countries that the transfer of part of the resources now used for weapons production to development programmes could have. In a world with limited resources  any investment in weapons and similar activities has an impact on disarmament. Progress in that field would release resources that could contribute to the attainment of the economic and social objectives of all countries and to the narrowing of the gap between the developed and the developing countries.In this respect  recent progress in the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union in the nuclear sphere strengthens our hopes. It would be desirable for this important step to be followed by others that could eliminate forever the risk of a nuclear war posed by research on and deployment and accumulation of nuclear weapons.The arms race has contributed to worsening the climate of tension and fostering international conflicts. For peoples that  in one way or another  have been the victims of the destructive force of military conflicts  nothing is more valuable than peace. Peace should be cherished by all  carefully preserved and encouraged at the international level.Regional demilitarisation is an important component of the building of peace. In this connection  it should be stressed that the decision taken by the General Assembly last year to declare the South Atlantic a zone of peace and co-operation has had a very positive effect on the strengthening of peace. The preservation of that region from any miniaturization  from the arms race  from the presence of foreign military bases  and from nuclear weapons will no doubt contribute to the well-being  co-operation and progress of the peoples of the region and to the strengthening of international peace.Over the past three years the Republic of Cape Verde has in its statements in the general debate emphasized its support for the multilateral process as the privileged tool in the quest for collective solutions to global problems. As we have said earlier in this statement  we are living today in a world that is increasingly interdependent at all levels. That can be seen between rich and poor  small and large  developed and developing countries alike. Recently  however  we have seen a trend among certain sectors towards relying on political  military and economic force in order to draw away from the universal values of multilateralism  in opposition to the views of the majority. Such behaviour  which is without any doubt negative  in a world which claims to be democratic  constitutes regression which can only fuel distrust.The crisis in multilateralism has become clear basically in institutions such as the United Nations which ate the most developed tools in the multilateral process. Some have termed this an institutional crisis  since it has been reflected in a lack of trust in international institutions. The origin of this crisis  it seems to us  resides in a recent trend towards weakening international democratic gatherings. In fact  institutions are what their members want them to be. The strength and effectiveness of institutions depend largely on the strength  trust and effectiveness their members wish to place in them. Negotiations which  last year  led to the adoption of a series of measures and recommendations for the administrative and financial reform of the Organization have highlighted the role the United Nations must play in the world today if we want to live in peace and security. We fervently hope that once the administrative and financial difficulties of the United Nations are overcome  all countries will seriously dedicate themselves to respect for the principles and pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations in the edifying task of building our great family - the human family.The Republic of Cape Verde attaches the utmost importance to the United Nations as a privileged forum where all countries of the world  regardless of their size  the number of their inhabitants  and the level of their development  can together find peaceful solutions to all conflicts  and where all countries  representing the entire human race  can  in complete sovereignty  find collective solutions to global problems.We come from a small country which is virtually barren of material resources and which must  therefore  deal with difficult and complex problems in order to ensure its economic survival and its development. By an accident of nature we are  therefore  in a position to grasp the immense difficulties confronted by most of the countries represented here in the struggle for economic development in order to ensure a more dignified existence for their people.Our struggle for development and for the dignity of our peoples is our way of making an important contribution to the age-old struggle of man to overcome physical difficulties and to build a world in which spiritual values reign supreme in human conduct and action. We are involved in a shared endeavour and we  the developing and developed countries  will be able successfully to achieve our task only if we ate united and sincere in our mutual relations.We are living in a century in which scientific and technical accomplishments have increased the powers of man to fulfil his desire to know and master the universe. We fervently hope that before the beginning of the twenty-first century these scientific and technical achievements will be directed above all towards the well-being  progress and happiness of all peoples on earth."
"34",1647,"CRI",42,1987,"﻿I come from a country you know well. You know our values  our struggle for development  our striving for peace. I come to ask you for help  to tell you that we need the support of all countries of good will if peace is to prevail in Central America.I have come to appeal for the strength of enduring principles in order to achieve peace  freedom and democracy in Central America. I have come to appeal for the political and diplomatic might of the world's nations  to enable us to set out together upon a new course that can ensure peace in the region.A year ago I came here to say that the fate of Central America hung on a decision between war and peace. Now I can tell you that the five States of Central America have cast their lot with peace. To end the war  political democracy must be established in all the countries of our America} freedom must be enjoyed by all citizens and human rights must be scrupulously respected within our borders.In the peace plan we signed in Guatemala  we asked for dialogue and amnesty. We want a cease—fire as soon as possible. We want an immediate beginning to democratization. We want free elections that reflect the true will of the majority of our peoples. We call on any Powers intervening in the region to suspend military aid. We want a guarantee that territories will not be used to stage attacks on other States. We seek a reduction in armaments. We request national and international supervision by the Contadora Group  the Support Group and the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. We propose guidelines to evaluate progress toward peace. We state that in an atmosphere of democracy and freedom development can take place that can enable us to enjoy a lasting peace. Those points represent years of effort by the Contadora Group and express the force of a century of democracy and freedom in my Costa Rica.Some are fearful of the peace agreement signed by the Central Americans. They say that what we are seeking to achieve has never been done before. They say that dialogue is impractical where hatred is so deep-rooted. They say that reconciliation is impossible when differences have been so pronounced foe so many years. They say that it is not possible to walk side by side when such extreme ideologies divide our people. They say that the word of a liar cannot be trusted. If we had to renounce anything that had never been done before  America would never have been discovered  nor would mankind ever have reached the moon. We would have to resign ourselves forever to accepting the impossibility of curing certain diseases  to accepting the persistence of war  to accepting a future of everlasting cruelty for Central America.I maintain just the opposite. We are obligated to try something different. We cannot relinquish imagination and courage in promoting the changes society requires. We cannot continue to pass through history in the shadows  bowed down by poverty and tormented by war. We cannot set out upon a new course gropingly  hesitantly  hoping that others will guide us. We demand peace  democracy and freedom  for we know where we want to go  and we know the kind of future we hope to build. We are tired of shedding tears. We yearn to share our ideals in order to work together for development. We want to take the fate of our region into our own hands.In the agreement signed in Guatemala we committed ourselves to work for peace in good faith. We have established  as a basis for dialogue  guidelines to be observed and goals to be achieved by all of the nations involved. We have set deadlines for achieving them. All of us agree that we roust take immediate steps toward those goals. To the extent that we attain them  credibility will grow and confidence will build among ourselves and in the eyes of the world. The sooner the guns are silenced  the sooner hatred will wither. The faster freedoms are re-established  the sooner our people will be able to enjoy democracy and the greater will be their respect for human tights.Let us be clear. No one has the right to judge the success or failure of the Central American path to peace in terms of artificially imposed deadlines. Some of the purposes of the agreement may be accomplished in less time than has been estimated} others may require more time. So long as real progress is being made toward national reconciliation  toward the enjoyment of freedom and toward an end to domestic warfare  to long as such progress is part of a new political reality  the plan will survive  the plan will continue in effect  and hope will spread everywhere.We are aware of the enormous scope of the obstacles we propose to overcome. We know that there are enemies at home and abroad who oppose the course charted by the Central Americans. But no failure to meet an unrealistic schedule can close the door to the rule of reason and to the elimination of war in Central America. The plan will no longer be valid or honest if any of the regional or non-regional players act with the deliberate intention to betray the agreement reached in Guatemala. It will no longer be valid or honest when there is clear evidence of an unwillingness to lay down arms  to move toward democracy or to seek national reconciliation. No one has the right to judge exclusively on the basis of past conduct. None of the players  none of the great Powers has the moral authority to cast the first stone. A new political reality is emerging in Central America. We ask for respect for regional self-determination. We ask for understanding. We ask for help in overcoming obstacles and moving closer to peace. The problems in Central America result from entrenched dictatorships and grievous social injustice. Decades of hunger and cruel suffering were and are evidence of the poverty-stricken lives led by millions of men and women in the region. We are certain that the restoration of democracy to the Central American republics will promote a shared  appropriate development that can meet the basic needs of the people promptly and reliably.We realize that we ourselves must take the primary responsibility for restructuring our economies. A significant part of that responsibility will be to make peace  for without peace there can be no development. We have begun to move towards peace and we are willing to make every effort to attain it. It is of vital importance that we should revive sustained development in order to ensure a better International position. We also need access to new markets and more favourable terms for the payment of our debt. It is essential for us to secure more stable prices for our exports.Central America has not been granted all the economic concessions it needs. The world economy is afraid of making exceptions on the premise that if -they are extended to some countries they must be extended to many others also. That argument is a pretext for not making exceptions even to alleviate the sufferings of poverty and the anguish of those who are struggling to maintain democratic systems at a time when peace is at stake and when more favourable economic conditions could help to bring war to an end.It is inconceivable that the calculating coldness of financiers should govern international relations. We have not made sufficient progress in renegotiating an external debt that we ate unable to repay on the terms originally stipulated. Very little progress has been made in opening up new markets and in stabilizing prices for our primary products. We must continue to insist on an international economy concerned with the poverty of certain countries. We need an international economy conducive to the strengthening of emerging democracies. There must be an international economy sensitive to the agonies of war and always allied to the hope for peace. We believe that the economy cannot be divorced from the political concerns of mankind designed to eliminate poverty and guarantee a stable peace among nations.In a world that presents a complex and sometimes hostile panorama. Central America stands today at the dawn of a new political era. Dialogue among the presidents of the five nations is re-emerging. Their ministers and their experts are talking. Armed rebels and Governments alike are engaging in dialogue. Reconciliation commissions have been set up. Many individuals are beginning to think about forgiving and being forgiven  about working together again. The men and women of our countries are doubtful about the policy of peace. There are powerful reasons for many to doubt. The task at hand is now to overcome obstacles and enrich dialogue  to ensure that every effort will lead to a little more freedom  a little more democracy  a little less violence. I should like to assure this Assembly that Costa Rica is firm in its determination to work for peace. Today a new climate is evolving in Central America. A waning faith is being reborn; it must be helped to flourish. We must believe again in freedom  in dialogue  in free expression of the will of the people. I have come to ask you to share this undertaking with us. I have come to appeal for your help.The Costa Rican delegation to this Organization will present to the Assembly the peace plan signed in Guatemala. We shall ask for approval of that plan In a resolution of the United Nations and for its adoption by this Assembly. We shall ask that it be backed by the full political force that the nations of the world bring to bear on identifying and supporting just causes in this forum. I am confident that we shall receive that support. I am certain that  together  we can say that the power of diplomacy and the validity of political accords undertaken in good faith will always be more effective than weapons  that they will always be stronger than war. I am certain that we shall walk the path of peace together in order to banish war from our region once and for all.The great French historian and statesman  Francois Guizot  said that ""pessimists are merely onlookers; it is the optimist who change the world"". I have come to invite this Assembly to participate with high optimism in this struggle to establish in Central America a territory of freedom  justice  democracy and peace.We for our part will redouble our efforts on behalf of all the noble causes in which this Organization is involved. With renewed vigour we condemn all manner of racial discrimination. We condemn the practice of terrorism  regardless of where it originates or how it is expressed. We indignantly condemn drug traffic. We should like to see International co-operation strengthened to combat these terrible threats  and we should like to see more severe punishment meted out to offenders.We should like to see the beginning of a dialogue designed to solve the problem of sovereignty in the Falkland .Islands. We should like to see the door opened  by means of dialogue  to reconciliation of the two Koreas. We should like dialogue to ensure the prompt and unconditional Independence of Namibia. We should like to have dialogue serve as the instrument for securing the prompt liberation of Kampuchea and Afghanistan. We applaud the Intensification of talks between the two Germanys and we support with renewed faith the efforts of the United Nations to secure peace in the Middle East.I reaffirm here my country's stand in favour of creating special financial arrangements to combat hunger in Africa  to mitigate the suffering of exiles  to expedite the consolidation of emerging democracies  and to promote peace efforts through the world. Costa Rica places high hope In disarmament negotiations between the super Powers. We encourage the reduction of arms In every corner of the planet. As a country without weapons  we know that security does not reside In force or in threats  much less in the use of violence. Security resides in progress towards shared development  in the prevailing of co-operation over selfishness. In respect for pluralism  in the rejection of Imperialistic designs.This time compassion will not suffice to ease the pain of countries that choose to make war  for whoever encourages war by word or deed will in the end be himself mortally wounded when his own sons are sent to die in lt. Fear of freedom causes many to seek refuge in arms. Fear of dialogue causes some to take refuge in dogmatism. We cannot turn our backs on history. How many times have we overcome one hatred only to develop another! How many times has a tyrant fallen only to be succeeded by another! How many times has democracy trembled before the treachery of disloyal armed forces! Let us now embark upon a new course. Let us confront the uncertainties involved in development. Let us assume the risks inherent in achieving peace  freedom and democracy.My country has invoked the most cherished principles and the loftiest values of mankind to put an end to war. It has invoked those principles to call for a more equitable international economy  to build a new economy with less poverty and more proprietors  to say that we are weary of dictatorships crushing the human spirit in many parts of the world  to repeat to the world that it is injustice that drives human beings to violence  and to proclaim that we must no longer commit the same mistakes over and over again.We are not apprehensive because everything seems more difficult at this time.Let us not be afraid because the problems are multiplying. Let us not be afraid because the solution of our difficulties may at some point be beyond our control or because hatred may temporarily prevail over love. It is up to us to explore the way to a new dawn of understanding and peace.Our poet Isaac Felipe Azofeifa left us a message of hope in the following inspiring words;""Yes  my child.The stars have all disappeared.But it is always darkestJust before the dawn.""We have an opportunity to rewrite history. I should like to say  in all humility  that it is our duty to do so. We must not see the past whenever we look towards the future. The time has come now to forge a better destiny for our peoples. I am certain that  with your help  with the efforts of all peoples and nations of goodwill   we will succeed. We are determined to try. Let us do it  now  together."
"35",1693,"CSK",42,1987,"﻿First of all. Sir  I should like to congratulate you heartily on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. We are sincerely pleased that this great honour has been bestowed upon a representative of a fraternal country  the German Democratic Republic. I wish you every success in carrying out your responsible duties.I wish also to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuellar  and to assure him of Czechoslovakia's support in his praiseworthy work on behalf of the United Nations and the entire international community.The general debate thus far has indicated - and I should like to believe - that the current session will make a significant contribution to the solution of the most urgent problems facing us today and that it will help in shaping the concept of a non-violent and nuclear-weapon-free world in which comprehensive security for all mankind would guarantee for everyone in the world the most. That hope is especially justifiable in the light of the agreement in principle between the USSR and the United States of America on the elimination of two classes of nuclear weapons  an agreement of great political and psychological importance. The conclusion of such a treaty  which is so strongly desired by the nations of the world  would lead for the first time in history to the agreed elimination of part of the world's accumulated nuclear arsenals. It would be a great step towards a genuine process of disarmament and would show that improvements are not confined to outlining theoretical programmes but are rather taking a concrete form.Prospects are opening for reaching further important agreements. The productive results of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe can undoubtedly be counted among the positive developments. An atmosphere of businesslike constructive dialogue prevailed also at the Vienna follow-up meeting of the States signatories of the Helsinki Final Act. Consultations are being held between representatives of countries of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on measures for conventional disarmament from the Atlantic to the Urals. Another positive international development is the contact between representatives of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and of the European Economic Community.A valuable contribution to the process of strengthening peace and understanding among peoples and improving the world situation has been made by the New Delhi Six. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has been undertaking peace-making activities  as was shown clearly by the outcome of its summit conference  held at Harare.All this confirms the emergence of a new thinking on a broad spectrum of issues in international relations. That new thinking is finding its way also into the halls and conference rooms of the United Nations  an organization designed to mould civilized relations among all countries and to harmonize their interests on a new basis.We are convinced that these glimmers of hope derive from real factors. We ate seeing the establishment and strengthening of a broad front of individuals  organizations  parties  governments and States united by their mutual goal of preserving human civilization. The socialist countries are doing their part in this struggle by taking qualitatively new initiatives based specifically on the process of activating the intrinsic potential of socialism and implementing programmes of restructuring. It could not be otherwise  since the ensuring of a lasting peace is an indispensable condition for the attainment of the objectives of restructuring and for the acceleration of social and economic development.However  we are aware that on the balance sheet of international relations there are still many items on the debit side. The arms race is continuing. New programmes of armament costing billions are being launched. local conflicts persist and threaten to grow into major international crises. Like a scar on the conscience of mankind  mass violations of human rights such as racism and apartheid persist. Crises in the world economy are growing worse. Environmental problems are reaching critical dimensions.All this sets a clear imperative for politicians  who bear a responsibility for the future of their nations: they must do their utmost to avert nuclear disaster  ensure stable peace and jointly resolve the most pressing problems of mankind.We are not far from the date when the first day of a new century and a new millennium will appear on our calendars. We have a unique opportunity to pass this planet on to posterity as a safe and good place to live. That context gives special prominence to the humanistic legacy of the great October socialist revolution  the seventieth anniversary of which will soon be commemorated by mankind. That was an event of extraordinary  epoch-making importance. It introduced into world politics the concept of peaceful coexistence between States with differing social systems. It is of more than symbolic significance that in its very first document  Lenin's decree on peace  the October Revolution rejected armed force as an instrument of foreign policy. Today in Czechoslovakia  in the socialist world  a major restructuring of all spheres of social life is under way in the light of those ideas  and the process of deepening socialist democracy is continuing. This is all tied very closely to universal human values  to the need to build and establish relationships of close joint action among States in our interrelated world  where the relationship between the national and the international is changing. It is an appeal to work together and make use of all the possibilities available.The Czechoslovak people have a vital interest in the success of the peace policy. They regard it as a guarantee of their present and their future. In the words of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  Gustav Husak: ""We shall contribute to the strengthening of the front of peace  sound reason and realism in the world so as to make the prospects of peace ever safer.""That aim is also being pursued through the initiative concerning the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security introduced in this forum by the socialist countries. It should constitute a set of specific  jointly agreed measures that would primarily provide  to an ever increasing degree  for greater effectiveness and practical reinforcement of the binding power of the fundamental laws of international life as embodied in the United Nations Charter.The reality of a secure world is inseparably tied to its safeguards. The mechanism for this should be the United Nations. This is our understanding of the well-known article by Mikhail S. Gorbachev that was published on the eve of this session. We believe that the suggestions formulated therein will give a strong impetus to the activity of the United Nations and of all States in building and safeguarding comprehensive security. We believe that the creation of security guarantees in the military sphere  the adoption of concrete measures for halting the arms build-up and proceeding to step-by-step disarmament  and the reduction of the military potential of States to reasonable levels are of decisive importance. Such measures would be conducive to the implementation of the programme  vital to mankind  for the elimination of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000. That programme is realistic because it is based on the need to ensure equal security for all participating countries at all stages of the disarmament process.We are confident that the first genuine breakthrough in the field of nuclear disarmament will be the conclusion and implementation o£ the treaty on the global elimination of Soviet and United States intermediate-range and operational-tactical nuclear missiles. We have done our best to facilitate that positive move towards real disarmament and. we are ready to continue our efforts in the expectation that other countries directly concerned will proceed in the same spirit.The conclusion of this treaty at a summit meeting should be a historic prologue to the unfolding of a comprehensive process of disarmament in which a 50 per cent reduction of strategic offensive weapons  with consistent observance of the Soviet-United States anti-ballistic-missile Treaty  could be the next step.We welcome the idea of stepping up the work of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament so that it may gradually become a permanent  universal negotiating body on disarmament. In our view it should work on a year-round basis. We feel that it would be appropriate to consider this subject also and to adopt corresponding measures  for instance at the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament  to be held next year.Another hopeful sign this year is the development with regard to a convention on the complete prohibition of chemical weapons and the elimination of stockpiles of such weapons. The conclusion of such a convention would also be an event of great importance for all mankind. In this context/ we appreciate the constructive statement of the Soviet Union in Geneva this year that in the negotiations it will proceed on the basis of the legal stipulation of the principle of mandatory inspections upon request and without the right of rejection. We fully endorse that approach and hope that other countries will proceed on the same lines. That position is a demonstration of the readiness of the socialist countries to ensure effective verification of the entire disarmament process in conditions of openness and confidence. In this spirit we want to take an active part in consideration of verification questions in the United Nations as well.The need to resolve the issue of a ban on the testing of nuclear weapons is ever more imperative. We believe that this  too  will be significantly facilitated by the agreed comprehensive phased negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States. We continue to regard it as extraordinarily important to prevent the stationing of weapons in space and agree on a programme of joint practical action in the peaceful uses of outer space. We support the establishment of a system of international verification of the preservation of peace in outer space.Global security is closely linked with the strengthening of security and the development of peaceful relations  co-operation and confidence in Europe  a continent which  unfortunately  is still burdened with an excessive quantity of nuclear and conventional arsenals. №at is why it is especially necessary to have a policy of détente  that process of consolidating the foundations of the common European house that is proof of the viability of the principle of the coexistence of the two systems. Today  after some vacillation and even stagnation  and doubts having been overcome  the all-European process is again gaining momentum. More pronounced results have been achieved in the political  military  humanitarian and other spheres. The Budapest appeal of the Warsaw Treaty countries to the States members of  the North Atlantic Treaty organisation (SATU) to agree on a substantial reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe remains highly topical. We are encouraged by the fact that the contours of future talks on those important questions  as well as on the development of confidence- and security-building  has begun to emerge in Vienna. We consider that those issues must be dealt with through the point of view of their interrelationship within the framework of the all-European process. An important part of European security and co-operation is the whole complex of mutual economic contacts. In order further to advance such contacts we proposed at the Vienna follow-up meeting the holding of a European economic forum in Prague  at which the whole range of questions relating to development in trade  industrial co-operation  finance and other specific areas would be addressed. Of no less importance in our view is the further development of co-operation in humanitarian matters. We are engaged in a constructive solution of these issues in both multilateral negotiations and bilateral relations. The entire humanitarian dimension of the European process  including respect for the political  civil  economic  social and cultural rights  should be considered at the proposed conference  the holding of which in Moscow we fully support. At the same time  it is our assumption that it is necessary to have an all-embracing approach to this subject  an approach that we are consequently pursuing.At the session of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member States held in Berlin this year we called on the countries members of the NATO to engage in joint consultations on military doctrines. We reaffirmed that the Warsaw Treaty States will never  under any conditions  launch military actions against any state or alliance of States unless they themselves become the object of an armed attack  and they also stated that they would never be the first to use nuclear weapons.As a country located along the line of contact between the two military and political groupings  we are very much interested in a supervised withdrawal of nuclear and other offensive weapons from national borders. We have therefore  jointly with the German Democratic Republic  proposed to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free corridor along the line of contact between the NATO and Warsaw Treaty countries in Central Europe. Similarly  we have put forward a joint initiative for the creation of a chemical-weapon-free zone in the Central European region. This measure could be the first step towards the complete elimination of chemical weapons.It is our view that stability would be strengthened significantly through implementation of the plan of the Government of the Polish People's Republic for a limitation of armaments and for enhancing trust and confidence in Central Europe. We call upon our partners to take a constructive stance on these proposals of ours and thus to engage in the solution of the questions of common security in a spirit of co-responsibility.The ensuring of comprehensive international security is unthinkable without energetic efforts to bring about a just settlement of international disputes and conflicts which  in a number of places  continue to undermine world peace and stability.We are deeply concerned over the dangerous escalation of military tension in the Persian Gulf  which threatens to result in an Internationalisation of the conflict. We fully support the United Nations Secretary-General in his efforts to bring about a termination of the Iraq-Iran war and we call for a consistent implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The safety of navigation in the Gulf must be provided for by efforts of the international community as a whole.We speak out with all resoluteness in favour of the holding of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and of other parties directly concerned  Including the Palestine Liberation Organization. The convening of such a conference is gaining ever increasing support. We regard as a key question the consequent exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination  including the establishment of their own State.We commend the adoption of a peace plan for Central America at a meeting of the presidents of the countries of that region held this year in Guatemala and we appreciate the meritorious activity of the Contadora Group and of the countries supporting it. we value the determined steps taken by the Nicaraguan Government to carry out the decisions adopted. We vehemently condemn the illegal pressure exerted on this country  which is in direct contradiction with the basic norms of international law.We are indignant over the untenable situation in southern Africa. The escalating acts of repression by the ruling racist minority against the native African population  the persisting occupation of Namibia and the overall increase in the aggressiveness of the Pretoria regime are destabilizing factors in international developments. We demand that all those who bear direct or indirect responsibility for the perpetuation of this perilous state of affairs proceed to adopt mandatory and effective sanctions  in harmony with the will of the international community  thus contributing to the eradication of apartheid. We resolutely support the just struggle of the front-line States against South African expansion.Our full support is extended to the policy of national reconciliation pursued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan with increasing co-operation from all national forces. We are convinced that this policy  together with the peace-making mediation of the United Nations  will lead to a just settlement of the existing problems. In parallel  an end must of course be put to outside intervention against this peace process.We welcome the fact that the idea of national consonance and harmony is gaining ground also in Kampuchea. We fully support the recent declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  which shows a realistic move towards genuine reconciliation and should therefore not remain unanswered.We firmly advocate the solution to the problem of Cyprus through the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations  to provide for the independence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of this non-aligned country. Due credit must be given to the constructive proposals made by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with a view to dissolving tensions on the Korean peninsula and achieving the withdrawal of foreign forces and nuclear weapons. The initiative for a reduction of armed forces by both sides and the manifest willingness to take important unilateral steps in that direction is a significant contribution to the achievement of a peaceful reunification of the country.A valuable contribution by the United Nations to efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement of disputes is the working out of a draft declaration on the enhancement of the effectiveness of the principle of non-use of force in international relations. We express our desire to see this declaration unanimously adopted by the Assembly at this session.A considerable contribution to the attainment of the aims and objectives of our Organization in the field of global security could be made through implementation of a number of regional projects that have been contemplated.Worthy of primary attention in this regard are  in our view  the concepts of security  co-operation  confidence  and reduction of armaments in the Asian-Pacific region  the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  the conversion of the Mediterranean into an area of peaceful co-operation  and the proposal for the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world. Extraordinary interest has been shown in recent days in the important initiative of the Soviet Union to ensure security and co-operation in the northern regions of our planet; Czechoslovakia fully endorses the initiative.The key tasks of achieving comprehensive security are also linked with the need for a basic improvement in international economic relations. Along with the other socialist countries  Czechoslovakia takes an unequivocal stance on these questions. A realistic solution can be found in generating the economic security of every State  of entire continents  and of the whole world within the framework of a comprehensive system of international security. This presupposes  among other things  the adoption of effective measures to break the fetters of massive indebtedness. What is required is the restructuring of the world monetary system  additional easements for the least developed countries  and gradual elimination of protectionism. Briefly  what is needed is the overcoming of backwardness through the dynamism of broad international economic co-operation. Similarly  we consider it necessary to develop further the ideas and conclusions of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. In their memorandum to the Conference the socialist countries presented an integrated plan for a realistic solution to those questions. We express our appreciation of the contributions made by all the participants to the success of the Conference.As regards the ecological dimension of security we see the underlying solution of the relationship between man and nature in all aspects of human activities  in an improvement in the quality and rational utilization of the environment and of its resources in the interests of individual nations and of people everywhere. This includes measures to prevent abuse of the environment as a result of industrial and agricultural production  the use of preventive measures and early warning systems  and reparations for damages in cases of ecologically dangerous accidents. Sooner or later  ecological security must also encompass elimination of the most hazardous factors that threaten to destroy the conditions for life on our planet  namely  weapons of mass destruction.For our part  we approach the discussion of these problems in all seriousness. As a State situated in the centre of Europe  we are confronted by those problems in an especially urgent manner. We allocate large sums of money for their solution. At the same time  we realize that an overall solution can be reached only if forces are joined within the framework of a global strategy for environmental conservation. We would urge the United Nations to begin to formulate such a strategy without delay. For our part  we are prepared at this session to contribute to such a programme.The endeavour to participate actively in finding constructive solutions to international problems has a long-standing tradition in our country. It emanates from the inherent interests of our people  from the very roots of our socialist society  and from the foreign policy of our country. in these efforts  we proceed from the assumption that the United Nations is an irreplaceable global mechanism for co-operation designed to solve the fundamental questions of our times and to serve as a universal guarantor of peaceful coexistence and comprehensive security. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic will continue to do its best to enhance the prestige of our Organization and make full use of its potential in the interests of peace and the security of nations. "
"36",1716,"CUB",42,1987,"﻿My delegation expresses its warmest congratulations to you  Sir  a worthy representative of the German Democratic Republic - a bastion of peace and socialism in Europe - on your assumption of the presidency of this important forty-second session of the General Assembly.We have all heard with great satisfaction about the positive results of the talks held in Washington between the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR  Comrade Eduard Shevardnadze  and the Secretary of State of the United States  Mr. George Shultz. The progress made towards an agreement on the banning of medium- and short-range missiles by the United States and the USSR deserves our fervent best wishes. It is the result of the efforts made for many years by the USSR - and especially of the initiatives of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Comrade Mikhail Gorbachev - and the efforts of the peace-loving forces to halt the arms race and eliminate the dangers of nuclear confrontation.A long time has passed since the signing of the last disarmament agreement  and we look forward to the early completion of the agreement to which I have just referred  so that it may initiate a process to end the arms race  a process for peace and life.The meeting held in the Federal Republic of Germany between the President of the Council of State and Ministers of the German Democratic Republic  Comrade Erich Honecker  and the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  Mr. Helmut Kohl  constitutes a meaningful expression of a new moment of hope in our international relations and of a desire to initiate a new trend towards dialogue  understanding and co-operation. This is a time for advancing negotiations to solve the conflicts and disputes of recent years  which have created hotbeds of tension jeopardizing the future of mankind.Sadly  in a few days our America will mark the twentieth anniversary of the death of an illustrious son of our continent  whom the people of Cuba have the fortune of counting as one of their best offspring and from whose legacy of ideas and action we have benefited. I should like to recall the following paragraph of the outstanding statement delivered by Commander Ernesto Che Guevara to the General Assembly at its session 23 years ago: ""We realize that today the Assembly is not in a position to demand explanations for ... acts) yet it must be clearly established that the Government of the United States is not the guardian of liberty  but rather that it is perpetuating the exploitation and oppression of many of the world's peoples and of many of its own citizens"". (Official Records of the General Assembly  Nineteenth Seas ion> 1299 the plenary meeting  para. 135) That assertion was an expression of its time. The reality is that the trends of the policies of successive United States Administrations - zigzagging but not changing in their essence - have not differed in any way from that definition  which has become even more valid in recent years.Between 1981 and 1985  the present United States Administration managed  at a specific historical juncture  to implement a brutal and aggressive policy aimed at imposing contested imperialist values through the use and threat of force and the obstruction of the negotiation process  thereby preventing progress on disarmament agreements and the solution of regional problems  and with the overt purpose of imposing its military superiority and hegemony over the socialist community.Reagan  in a unique and exemplary manner worthy of better endeavours  implemented and followed the essence  spirit and letter of the Santa Fe programme. This May 1980 Santa Fe programme undoubtedly represented the philosophy of pillage  the expansion of so-called spheres of influence and the prevalence of force in international relations. The direct reflection of this policy was soon evidenced in the arms race. Between 1980 and 1986 the military budget of the United States doubled. In essence  the Santa Fe document stated that ""war and not peace is the rule in international affairs""  that ""detente is death""  and that the United States did not have to struggle to preserve the status quo but  rather  had to struggle to improve its relative position in all spheres of influence.Reagan  with an apparent halo of success - having obtained barely 26.7 per cent of the votes in the United States - intoxicated by power and the prospect of playing a leading role in history  launched a truly anachronistic and senseless crusade  which was tolerated or supported by his main allies. Important agreements that had been reached as a result of perseverance  consistency and realism in approaching the international situation were denounced or rejected - for example  the significant SALT II agreements. Tensions in international relations increased  thereby adding fuel to the fire of various international conflicts. Reagan proclaimed and exalted his alliance with dictatorial regimes and with the supporters of the most ignoble causes in southern Africa and the Middle East  in Central America and the Caribbean  in the southern part of the American continent. In so doing  he stopped all criticism and condemnation of human-rights violations by his allies  for the purpose of protecting an alliance devoid of principles or decency.Anyone who took up arms against the independence of peoples had the support of the United States. Whenever a banner was hoisted in favour of independence and social justice  the United States tried to force it down. Accordingly  it increased its acts of aggression against Nicaragua  its threats against Cuba and its support of the Zionists in the Middle East  as well as its close solidarity with the racists in Pretoria and with the Savimbi and Rename bandits in Angola and Mozambique. It closed ranks with British imperialists in the military occupation of the Malvinas Islands - which jeopardized the credibility of the Rio Treaty - and invaded the tiny island of Grenada  in its best gunboat style. In that period  the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the siege of Beirut took place prominent international leaders such as Indira Gandhi and Olof Palme were assassinated; the USSR suffered in a very short time the loss of its top State and Party leaders  Comrade Leonid Brezhnev and his successors  Comrades Andropov and Chernienko. The summit conferences of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of African Unity could not be held as scheduled.	""The Reagan Administration  Imbued with a spirit of victory  its eyes and ears closed to world realities  tried to demonstrate that ""in war there is no substitute for victory""  in conformity with Mr. Reagan's view that the mistake of the Viet Nam war was not to have waged it but to have lost it.Such triumphalism met with serious obstacles at the end of 1986  when Reagan suffered major defeats inside and outside the United States which shook his already dubious credibility and his unquestionable power. Early in October he suffered his greatest setback in foreign policy - soon to be more than surpassed - when  respectively  the House of Representatives and the Senate  the latter still with a Republican majority  overruled the presidential veto of economic sanctions against South Africa. That veto was inspired by the fallacy of ""constructive engagement""  or ""silent diplomacy""  proclaimed by Reagan. In the November legislative elections  the Democrats regained the majority in the Senate and strengthened their control over the House of Representatives  despite Reagan's personal efforts  his 40 000 kilometres of travel and his visits to 18 States. That significant defeat coincided with huge budget and trade deficits and the forecasts of a forthcoming economic recession  in November the so-called Irangate and Contragate manure bomb  exploded  with brutal virulence. The final act of this tragicomedy has yet to be played out.At the same time  there were major political processes and developments aimed at the relaxation of international tensions and at the opening of a new era of understanding among States - although many of the processes had originated years before  and some had found a sympathetic hearing in the General Assembly.Let us recall some of those milestones.Addressing the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly in his capacity as Chairman and on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  Commander Fidel Castro presented the all-important demands of the underdeveloped world. He said at that time: ""... unequal exchange is ruining and impoverishing our peoples and must cease. Inflation  which is being exported to us  is impoverishing our peoples and must cease. Protectionism impoverishes our peoples and must cease. The existing imbalance in the exploitation of sea resources is abusive and must be abolished. The financial resources received by the developing countries are insufficient and must be increased. Arms expenditures are irrational; they must cease and the funds thus released must be used to finance development. The international monetary system prevailing today is bankrupt and must be replaced. The debts of the least developed countries and of those in a disadvantageous position are burdens which are impossible to bear and to which no solution can be found and they must be cancelled. Indebtedness oppresses the rest of the developing countries economically and must be relieved. The wide economic gap between the developed countries and the countries seeking development  instead of diminishing  is being widened and must be closed ... . (A/34/PV. 31  pp. 42 and 43-45)Eight years have passed since then. The only thing that has changed is that the unequal exchange is even more unequal) the ruin of our peoples as a result of inflation and protectionism is worsening; the imbalance in the exploitation of the resources of the sea is abusive; the allocation of financial resources to the developing countries is diminishing and is tragically insufficient) the international monetary system remains bankrupt) the debt of the relatively least developed countries has long since gone beyond rationality and simply cannot be paid. In short  the economic gap between developed and developing countries is wider and has grown unbridgeable.When the Contadora Group was established in January 1983 it was like a wind of hope amidst the imperial storm. Its aim was to contribute to a peaceful  political  negotiated solution to the Central American conflict it was later joined by the Support Group and was recently enhanced by the important Esquipulas II agreements.The seventh summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries took place in New Delhi in March 1983. That summit conveyed a clear message  and took a firm anti-imperialist  anti-colonialist stand against Zionism  racism and apartheid  in favour of peace and of the peaceful negotiated solution of international disputes  against the arms race and the rule of force  and in support of a new international economic order.Also in March  but March 1985  Mikhail Gorbachev was elected General-Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  He gave the socialist society of that great country new ideas and a realistic and dynamic stand in the present world  with new approaches and methods for the creative application of the Soviet principles of peace  disarmament and coexistence under present conditions.Very soon the influence of solid proposals oriented towards disarmament and the establishment of a climate of détente  of international safeguards and security - in other words  a climate of peaceful coexistence - was felt. Among them are the Vladivostok proposals and the August 1985 unilateral moratorium  broadened at the Reykjavik meeting of October 1986   where Comrade Mikhail Gorbachev proposed  among other important ideas  the working out of a draft agreement aimed at reducing strategic weapons by not less than 50 per cent and eliminating them completely during this century.However  Reagan's stubbornness in attempting to perpetuate the strategic defence initiative  which includes research and testing in outer space and opens a new era in the arms race  frustrated the possibility of reaching agreement at that epoch-making meeting. But we should not be pessimistic. The Reykjavik meeting proved that  at this crucial time for mankind  dialogue is both possible and necessary and that open  realistic dialogue not aimed at the military superiority of one side over the other may lead to agreement.In June 1986 the International Court of Justice decided in favour of ending military activities against Nicaragua.The Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit conferences resumed. The chairmanship passed from Abdou Diouf of Senegal in 1985  to Denis Sassou-Nguesso of Congo  Chairman for 1986  and recently to Kenneth Kaunda  President of Zambia and current Chairman of that outstanding organization.The eighth summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Zimbabwe in September 1986  confirmed the firmness of its principles in the struggle against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  against racism  including Zionism  and apartheid. The summit  which took place in a country bordering the racist Pretoria regime  constituted an exceptional expression of the international will to eliminate apartheid and attain the independence of Namibia. It also gave new impetus to the struggle for international peace and security  for the establishment of a new international economic order  for disarmament and for the development of third-world countries.Since the Harare summit Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has continued its intense activity  focusing on the issues of greatest Importance and tension  namely the peace message addressed to the General-Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Comrade Gorbachev  by the Heads of State or Government and its delivery to the Government of the United States; the New Delhi meeting of Heads of State or Government of the Africa Fund Committee and its appeal for strengthened support for the struggle of the front-line States and liberation movements in southern Africa) the decision of the extraordinary meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau on the situation in Latin America and the Caribbean  and  most recently  the visit to Nicaragua of the Foreign Minister of Zimbabwe during the meeting of the Contadora and Support Group Foreign Ministers  to reiterate our solidarity in support of a peaceful solution of the Central American conflict and our rejection of the United States aggression and Interference in the region; the solidarity  expressed at the meeting of the Committee of Nine on Palestine  with the struggle of the Palestinian people to exercise their rights and establish an independent State in their homeland  and in favour of the early convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East; and the Brioni meeting of non-aligned Mediterranean States and its appeal for the strengthening of co-operation and peace in the region.In June 1987  at the Extraordinary Ministerial Conference of Non-Aligned Countries on South-South Co-operation  the Pyongyang Declaration and Plan of Action for economic co-operation was signed; simultaneously  at Harare  the Conference of Ministers of Information advocated the establishment of a new information order. On 7 August  the five Central American Presidents signed the epoch-making Esquipulas II agreements with an express will to search for peace in the region. Between 1981 and 1986 - as evidence of the rejection by nations of the United States policy of force - the voting pattern of all regional groups in the United Nations showed less coincidence with United States votes. The number of Member States whose votes coincided with those of the United States in more than 60 per cent of the time declined by more than half. That is  only half the countries which voted with the United States more than 60 per cent of the time in 1980 did so in 1986 - and their number was small. Moreover  at the forty-first session only 10 countries voted with the United States more than 60 per cent of the time.The deterioration in the living conditions of the peoples of the third world  the increasing erosion of their economies and the worsening inequalities in the terms of trade in the Western industrialized world continue their galloping course. The international economic situation  particularly that of third-world countries  has become untenable. The low prices of major commodities} the protectionist measures applied by highly industrialized countries  the escalating increase in external debt and interest rates and the curtailment of external financing and the conditionality of lending by the International Monetary Round and the World Bank  including supervision of the domestic policies of recipient countries - all paint a gloomy picture of the prospects of underdeveloped countries.Moreover  the spiralling arms race has further aggravated this dramatic economic picture and the prospects for development.In late August and early September  the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was held. It affirmed the need to seek a solution to such an urgent situation. At the same time the idea that there will be no peace without development is  in Cartesian language  an obvious and inescapable truth. Cuba welcomes the positive results of that Conference  which  though marked by the absence of the United States  which bears principal responsibility for the arms race  nevertheless engaged in a complex  delicate and constructive negotiating process in which recognition of the inevitable link between disarmament and development and of the urgent need to devote resources released by disarmament immediately to development prevailed.In recent years  our peoples have waged a prodigious struggle against the unbearable burden of external debt. Commander Fidel Castro  in particular  has courageously and decisively denounced that situation internationally. He has demonstrated objectively and unquestionably that the external debt is unpayable and that writing it off would not suffice to eliminate the misfortunes of our peoples unless such action was linked to the establishment of a new international economic order and to the necessary relationship between debt and disarmament. Many meetings attended by thousands of delegates from the most representative sectors of Latin America and the Caribbean were held in Havana in recent years with the purpose of considering and discussing  with vigour and courage  the external debt problem·  economists  jurists  workers  students  journalists  women  the military  priests  peasants  statesmen and personalities in the fields of the arts and sciences with profound knowledge of the Latin American reality and actors of the drama our region is enduring participated in those meetings  which were convened in the light of historic inequalities brought about by centuries of imperialist  capitalist and neo-colonialist exploitation.As this brief summary shows  even if a number of particularly relevant events ace necessarily missing  these are times of hope t the seemingly successful drive of the Reagan Administration has come to a halt and fallen back} the fruitful activities of important international organizations have strengthened and a climate of negotiations is felt in Europe  Central America  southern Africa  Afghanistan and South-East Asia. We should do our utmost to keep up this momentum.The United Nations should contribute with all its influence to achieving peace and political solutions to conflicts and disputes among nations. The efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General  Javier Perez de Cuellar  for contributing to putting an end to the fratricidal war between Iraq and Iran are a good example of this.The world is facing the dilemma of peace and war. We have no right to ignore the outcry of our peoples; we have to prepare ourselves to live in peace. We have to create mechanisms which inspire and ensure confidence among peoples  security among States and peaceful and productive coexistence among nations. We have to lay the foundations for future relations so that the generations of the twenty-first century do not live in shame of their parents' legacy.Twenty-five years ago next October  the world was on the verge of a nuclear war. A quarter of a century later  notwithstanding the severe economic blockade imposed upon us by imperialism  notwithstanding all types of aggressions  including attempts against the lives of our leaders  notwithstanding the enormous resources used against Cuba  our revolution has been and will continue to be an unassailable bastion of Latin American dignity  firmness and fortitude.When the major contributor to the United Nations withholds its contribution and does not fulfil its obligations under the pretext of differences between the executive and legislative powers  it is really attempting to impose its interests on the United Nations  thus impairing the interest of the great majority of the Members of the Organization. In these circumstances  General Assembly resolution 41/213 cannot be implemented. We must demand that the United States cease this niggardly policy.There is no doubt that such a policy of force and blackmail has not succeeded  thanks to the unity and cohesion of dignified and independent countries  which allows us to say that multilateralism - the United Nations - continues to show  with commendable impetus  our positions  our rights and our demands in the pursuit of a world without war  of equality and equitable peace for all.We welcome today the negotiating will expressed by the five Central American Presidents  as reflected in the Esquipulas II Agreements  even in the face of resistance by certain circles in the present United States Administration  which attempt to maintain aggression  blockade and destabilisation against the legitimate Government of Nicaragua.Cuba considers that the independent attitude of the countries signatories of the Guatemala Agreement is a new event in the history of the region. The huge efforts exerted over the years by the Contadora and Support Groups in pursuit of a Latin American solution to the serious Central American crisis contributed considerably to that.We must pool our efforts and take concrete actions in order to achieve the implementation of those important agreements and be determined to adopt necessary measures for the economic reconstruction of Central American countries. We must continue to support the efforts of the Contadora and Support Groups in favour of peace in Central America.Nicaragua has the right to live in peace and is entitled to exercise its sovereign right to choose the options it deems most appropriate to satisfy its national needs. We must support those who struggle in favour of liberty and dignity in El Salvador and in every corner of a continent where the ideas of Bolivar  Marti and Juarez are increasingly reaffirmed.The record of these years reaffirms that the unity  firmness and awareness of the problems and of our strength to tackle them successfully is an undeniable fact. Today we may assert that the policy of confrontation is undergoing serious setbacks and we witness certain negotiating trends that  although they are slow  are making progress. This proves that our peoples are able to make their desires for peace prevail.We welcome negotiation efforts  such as the process aimed at achieving the dismantling of medium-range missiles in Europe  and the national reconciliation plan chartered by the Government of Afghanistan and its contacts with the United Nations Secretary-General in the search of a just and equitable solution  which will guarantee peace and security in the area.The Indochina's peoples in South-East Asia are working hard to find formulas leading to a peaceful negotiated process beneficial to the entire region through a flexible and constructive dialogue. We support the policy of national reconciliation formulated by the People's Republic of Kampuchea in the pursuit of peace for all its people; without distinction of class  ideology  ethnicity or religion.On southern Africa  as expressed on 1 August in Havana  Cuba and Angola are in a position to make their common position flexible on the basis of the principles of the November 1984 Platform and its annex  with a view to promoting the constructive aim of a just and honourable agreement which may bring about the independence of Namibia  the security of Angola and peace for all States in southern Africa.Cuba will maintain its stand of internationalist support and solidarity with the Government of the People's Republic of Angola in accordance with the Agreements signed with the Government of that sister nation. Cuba shall contribute to the maintenance of stability and prevention of any aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and  in an active and effective way  shall work for real peace in the region. Essential for that purpose are the independence of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  its sole and legitimate representative  and the definitive elimination of the ignominious apartheid regime.We must redouble our efforts and render our solidarity to the people of South Africa for the total elimination of apartheid) to the people of Puerto Rico for the achievement of their freedom and independence) for the convening of the peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)) and for the solution of the long and bloody conflict regarding the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the establishment of its own state. There will be no solution to the Middle East conflict unless the Palestinian problem is solved  under the leadership of its sole and legitimate representative  the PLO. We should continue to support the just cause of the Lebanese people for its national unity and peace  the security of its people and respect for its territorial integrity and non-aligned status. We support demands for the withdrawal of the Moroccan troops and administration from Western Saharan territory as the essential condition to hold the referendum on the self-determination of the Sahraoui people} for Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands  for the aspiration of the Comoro Islands to recover sovereignty over Mayotte and for the return of Madagascar's rights over the Malagasy Islands of Glorieuses  Juan de Nova  Europa and Bassas da India. We should provide firm and active support to the people of Cyprus  a non-aligned country struggling to defend its independence  national unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity. We support initiatives to convene an international conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  which many lead to progress towards a solution to the situation that now endangers its territorial integrity and national existence.The Indian Ocean demands a greater will from the States responsible for its militarization in order that they reverse their nefarious policy. Meanwhile  we must continue to exert efforts for the early realization of the desire to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. Contrary to our long-standing endeavours to demilitarise the Indian Ocean  we witness with shock the spread of military forces in the Persian Gulf  which jeopardize its security and pose a serious threat to security and peace in the area and world-wide. Let us increase our demands for the elimination of all military presence from that sensitive area.We must recall the situation prevailing in the trusteeship of the Pacific Islands  where the Government of the United States in an arbitrary  unilateral and illegal manner has sought to consolidate and perpetuate its colonial presence.We denounce attempts to prevent the independence and sovereignty of so-called Micronesia. We reiterate our categorical support for the legitimate Bolivian demand to recover direct and useful access to the Pacific Ocean  with full sovereignty over that access. We denounce the absence of will on the part of the Chilean regime to continue the negotiations initiated between the two Governments to find a just solution.We demand strict compliance with the 1977 Torrijos-Carter treaty on the Panama Canal  and reject manoeuvres by the Government of the United States to violate it and perpetuate its domination and military presence in the isthmus.We reiterate our firm solidarity with the sisterly Democratic People's Republic of Korea  arduously struggling for the realization of its people's desire for peaceful reunification and the withdrawal of United States occupation troops from the south of the peninsula.We support the position of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea that Korea must not enter the United Nations in the present state of partition  and that entry must wait until it succeeds in reuniting the country. We also support the co-sponsorship of the forthcoming Olympic Games by both States  as an instrument of unity and peace between nations.We advocate a speedy solution of the regrettable conflict between Iran and Iraq  which should never have begun  and which continues to cause irreparable losses to both peoples. We support the redoubling of efforts by the United Nations to find a peaceful solution  just and honourable for both sides  thus ending this fratricidal war  which has been going on now for more than seven years. We are firmly convinced that it is more than ever imperative to co-ordinate our action  our unity and our struggle to impose what we desire: détente  dialogue  peace  and development. From the very dawn of the Revolution my Government and people  have suffered the harassment  blockade and aggression of a powerful neighbour. We have learned to live with imperialist aggression and pressure. Although that was not our wish  it is the reality we have had to face. We stand for peace and negotiation in international relations  especially in our continent and with our neighbours. We have never practised an aggressive or hostile policy. Our sole ""sin"" may have been the exercise of the right of our people - enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in any international forum - freely to choose its own system and its own principles of genuine national independence.Benito Juarez  an illustrious Latin American leader  said  ""Respect for the tight of others is peace."" We regret that the Government of our powerful northern neighbour does not apply this thinking in its international relations.We have resisted  and shall continue to resist. We have seen different administrations come and go  while our Revolution has developed and become stronger  hoping that the good sense  wisdom and genuine tradition of the American people will prevail  and that the need for coexistence will be recognized.We have learned the importance of unity and cohesion in order to resist and overcome. Today  more than ever before  in view of international initiatives seeking paths to negotiation and a new state of relations  we reaffirm our permanent and irrevocable attachment to peace and coexistence."
"37",1762,"CYP",42,1987,"﻿It is with great pleasure. Sit  that I extend to you my warmest congratulations on your election to the high office of the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. The confidence shown in you by this body is a tribute by the international community to you personally  as well as to your country  with which Cyprus maintains close and friendly relations. I have no doubt that  with your experience and skill  you will guide the deliberations of this session to a successful conclusion.I also wish to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Choudhury  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  on the impeccable manner in which he discharged his difficult task as President of the forty-first session  honouring both his country and the Asian region in general. We also express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts on behalf of the United Nations.The opening of this year's session coincided with a historic development. The conclusion of the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of medium- and short-range missiles is of paramount importance not only as far as relations between the two super-Powers are concerned but also for humanity as a whole. This development has naturally given rise to well-founded optimism regarding the future of mankind. One can of course validly argue that the danger of a nuclear catastrophe has not yet been completely and definitely eliminated. Yet  the recent agreement in Washington is a specific and substantive step in that direction. It also provides concrete evidence of the political will of the United States and the Soviet Union to world together  despite the great difficulties that still exist owing to the divergence of their views on many issues  foe the purpose of gradually reducing and finally eliminating the very real clanger that is facing humanity's very existence and survival  especially since the beginning of the nuclear arms race.We hope and trust that the agreement concluded in principle in Washington will soon be finalized  signed and implemented and that it will be followed by other agreements in the field of nuclear disarmament. We do not underestimate the difficulties with regard to some specific aspects of nuclear disarmament  but we strongly believe that certain additional steps could easily be taken that would on the one hand strengthen mutual confidence  which is still greatly needed  and on the other enhance the process towards the goal of complete nuclear disarmament. While efforts to tackle the more difficult aspects must continue in a sustained manner  steps such as the complete banning of nuclear tests and the effective tackling of the issue of chemical weapons should be taken without further delay.Continued progress in the field of nuclear disarmament  extremely important in itself  will also enable the two super-Powers steadily to improve their relations and will facilitate the promotion of close co-operation between them in dealing with other problems  whether global or regional  the solution of which must be sought with urgency and determination. It is indeed hoped and expected that  parallel to the dialogue for nuclear disarmament and disarmament in general  concerted efforts will be made by the two super-Powers to address as a matter of urgency the other problems as well. We do not suggest that the two super-Powers have the right to apply to these problems solutions of their own choice/ but we are realistic enough to acknowledge the fact that they are in a position to influence developments and contribute decisively to the solution of these problems. The common denominator cannot of course be other than the principles of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations.In other words  we believe that the United Nations can become effective only if the permanent members of the Security Council  and particularly the two super-Powers  decide to make it effective through joint action. The obvious answer to the question how this can be achieved is through agreement by the super-Powers and all the other members  particularly the other permanent members  of the Security Council to stand firmly by the Council's decisions and act together resolutely for their strict implementation in all cases  without distinction  irrespective of whom those decisions affect  thus abandoning the tendency to adopt double standards  as has so far been the case. This is the only possible way to make the Security Council effective  and it is the only possible way to solve most of the problems that still confront the world.Year after year in this forum we all speak of the imperative necessity to turn the United Nations into an effective instrument for peace and security in the world  as envisaged by its founding Members and as provided for in its Charter. Most of us  year after year  speak in this Hall of the imperative necessity to establish a comprehensive system of International security through the existing mechanisms and procedures provided for by the Charter. It is now more pressing than ever before to begin meaningful and result-oriented deliberations to achieve this purpose  which is also closely related to ongoing efforts in the field of disarmament  as well as to the tackling and settlement of other global and regional problems. When we speak of the necessity to continue a dialogue and the process towards disarmament  when we speak of the necessity to establish in practice a comprehensive system of international security  when we speak of the necessity to tackle effectively and solve all other global and regional problems  we strongly maintain that those efforts should be parallel  because  owing to their interrelationship  any progress in one field will automatically increase the prospects for further progress in the others.It is indeed encouraging and heartening that today we look to the future with full optimism and confidence. We hope that as time goes by that optimism and confidence will increase and be consolidated. Mankind needs to see some more tangible achievements to make it feel secure about its future. It is in this spirit that we look forward to more positive results within the framework of the dialogue between the two super-Powers  and it is in the same spirit that we expect more such results from the forthcoming meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev  beyond the signing of the agreement already concluded in principle a few days ago in Washington. We sincerely wish both of them every success.In underlining and stressing the paramount importance of the role of the super-Powers in relation to all international problems  it has not been my intention to minimize or underestimate the role and the significant contribution of all the other countries that comprise the membership of the United Nations. On the contrary  we must not stand aside or wash our hands of problems  leaving everything to the super-Powers. Nor can such an attitude facilitate the efforts of the super-powers themselves. The entire membership of the United Nations has important and heavy responsibilities to discharge. In fact  the improvement in the international climate as a result of the rapprochement between the super-Powers has increased the possibilities for all Members of the United Nations  whether big or small  individually and collectively  to contribute more substantively and meaningfully to the achievement of our common goals and objectives. This  I must stress once again  is not limited to any specific country or group of countries alone. It is not limited to the allies of the two super-Powers  as it is not limited to other groups of countries  such as the European Economic Community which  owing to its strength and influence  has no doubt a special role to play. It is not limited to the permanent members of the Security Council or to the members of the Security Council as a whole. Collective efforts on the part of all regional organizations are also important. Important initiatives  such as the initiative of the Six - Greece  Sweden  Argentina  Mexico  India and Tanzania - must continue with more determination in the light of recent developments. The contribution of all is needed much more than ever before.In this connection  I would like to stress the importance I attach to the role of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  to which most of us in this Assembly belong. The Movement has  since its establishment  played a positive and constructive role in world affairs  utilizing the great moral force it represents. The prospects have now increased for the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to play an even greater and more effective role. I would like to reiterate today what I stressed at the last summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at Harare  that we must now concentrate on how to increase the effectiveness of our Movement. I pledge that Cyprus  despite its small size and strength and in spite of the constraints imposed on it by its particular problem  will work hard for this objective. We will co-operate with all others in the Movement in order to arrive at concrete conclusions that can be taken up at the next full ministerial conference of the Movement  which will take place on 5 September next year  and which we will have the honour to host in Cyprus. I personally attach great importance to that meeting and we must all world together for its success.I have already expressed my conviction that the new climate created as a result of the agreement reached recently in Washington  and which has improved the relations between the two super-Powers  will foster conditions conducive to the search for solutions to other major international problems and regional crises.One of these problems  of world-wide interest and concern  is the prevailing economic situation. This manifests itself as a structural crisis and  in turn  urgently points to the need for increasing multilateral co-operation in seeking solutions to the various aspects of the problem. The gap between North and South is ever present. Furthermore  the external debt crisis continues to be one of the most serious obstacles to the progress and genuine sovereignty of many developing countries A  new international economic order is of the utmost importance in itself and the efforts towards establishing it must continue in a sustained manner  the interrelationship between this target and the final overall objective of lasting peace and security in the world being borne always in mind. In this respect  the interrelationship between disarmament and development must also be stressed. This was reaffirmed and underlined by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development and it is clear that further steps are needed to translate the unanimous conclusions of the Conference into concrete actions for the benefit of all countries and peoples.The new climate should also be utilized for tackling  as a matter of urgency  the various regional problems that continue to pose a serious threat to peace and security. There can be no doubt that to achieve solutions to these problems there must be more than ever before be common action and co-operation among nations  in this respect  the role of the permanent members of the Security Council and  in particular  that of the two super-Powers is of paramount importance. And there is no other way of successfully dealing with these problems except by abiding strictly by the principles and purposes of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations and by ensuring their respect and implementation.The principles enshrined in the Charter and embodied in regional instruments  such as the Helsinki Final Act - the non-use of force or threat of the use of force  non-interference and non-intervention  equal rights and self-determination of peoples  as well as basic human rights and fundamental freedoms - are still being flagrantly violated in different parts of the world  thus protracting dangerous and explosive situations and contributing to the breakdown of legal order and security in the respective regions.It should no longer be tolerated that millions of people in the world suffer daily from gross violations of their human rights  despite the existence of internationally accepted legal instruments. Such instruments  concluded during the United Nations era  embody the moral conscience of mankind and represent the humanitarian standards that should guide the behaviour of all members of the International community in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms.Yet  the abhorrent policy of apartheid is still a grim reality in South Africa. The international community has so far been unable to put an end to this crime  which is being perpetrated against the very conscience of mankind and which constitutes a challenge to the authority of the United Nations. Condemnations have been voiced from all parts of the world  but concrete actions  expressly provided for in the Charter  remain un-adopted owing to the lack of unanimity among the permanent members of the Security Council. It is to be hoped that as a result of the new spirit that has recently emerged to play an effective and decisive role in solving problems f the Security Council and  in particular  its permanent members  will find a way to reach agreement on specific action in conformity with the Charter that will finally put an end to the intolerable situation in South Africa.The situation in South Africa is one of those cases which I had in mind when  earlier in my statement  I spoke of the need to do away with the ill concept of double standards. This clearly relates both to obstacles to the adoption of resolutions by the Security Council in certain cases  and in other cases to the non-implementation of resolutions adopted  sometimes unanimously. A glaring example of the latter is the situation in Namibia  a problem that could easily be solved if the pertinent resolutions of the Security Council were to be strictly implemented. And again  it is the primary responsibility of the permanent members of the Security Council to see to it that this is done.In the Middle East  the Palestine people  led by the Palestine Liberation Organization  continues to struggle for its inalienable rights. Despite the adoption of so many resolutions by the United Nations  the Palestinian people are still being denied its inalienable rights  including the right to establish their own independent State. It is again high time for the permanent members of the Security Council and  as in all other cases  the super-Powers in particular to take the political decision to work together for the resolution of this problem  which lies at the heart of the entire Middle East problem and which continues to present a real threat to international peace and security. Let those who have the power to resolve the problem reflect on the bloodshed and misery inflicted on the peoples of the countries involved  including Lebanon  where the situation has reached the dimensions of a real tragedy threatening the territorial integrity and unity of that friendly country. With regard to the situation in the Middle East  we fully support the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization. As for Central America  we welcome and support the agreement reached recently in Guatemala among the Presidents of the countries of the region. We also fully support the efforts of the Contadora and Support Groups in seeking permanent peace and stability in this troubled region. But again it must be stressed1 that if that is to be achieved  the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the area and of non-intervention and non-interference  provided for in the Charter  should be strictly observed.Much has already been said in this Assembly regarding the war between Iran and Iraq and the explosive situation in the Gulf. We must all render our support to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his efforts in this respect and we hope and trust that the involvement of the Security Council will lead the way to the restoration of peace and security in the area.	.In referring to pertinent resolutions of the Security Council  regarding various issues some speakers from this rostrum stressed the mandatory nature of the resolutions of the Security Council. They went even further to remind representatives of the relevant provisions of the Charter providing for specific measures in case of anyone's failure to comply with those resolutions. I could not think of a more appropriate way to commence my remarks with regard to the Cyprus problem. It is exactly because the resolutions of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular have been completely ignored by Turkey  that the Cyprus problem still remains unresolved. And it is because Turkey does not feel the need to respect these resolutions that it has yet to abandon its expansionist and partitionist designs against Cyprus. It is high time for Turkey to be reminded in a convincing manner of the mandatory nature of the Security Council resolutions and of the relevant provisions of the Charter in case of failure to conform with those resolutions.Thirteen years have gone by since the invasion and occupation of 37 per cent of our territory by Turkey. A number of resolutions and decisions of the United Nations demanded the withdrawal of the occupation troops  respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus  the return of the refugees to their homes under conditions of safety  the cessation of the destruction of the cultural heritage of Cyprus by Turkey  the restitution of human rights to all Cypriots  the speedy tracing of the missing persons  and the reversal of all actions aimed at the secession of the occupied part and consolidation of the division. Contrary to the demands of the international community  the Cyprus problem has not yet been solved and Turkey continues to pursue the same expansionist and partitionist policy  contemptuously ignoring the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations.On our part  we did whatever we could to facilitate a solution by offering a series of very serious concessions — concessions that I do not believe any Government of any other country represented in this Assembly would have offered in similar circumstances. Yet the Cyprus problem has not been solved. We have known from the beginning  and we have been trying hard to point out everywhere f that the Cyprus problem is not primarily a constitutional one. It is basically a problem of invasion and occupation  of foreign intervention  of colonization of the occupied part by settlers from Turkey and of an attempt to destroy the culture and civilization of the country for the first time in its history of thousands of years. It is a problem of flagrant violation by Turkey of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Cypriot people. It is a problem of expansionism on the part of a strong neighbour - perhaps  as might be proved  not only at the expense of Cyprus but also at the expense of Greece and possibly other countries in the area. It is a problem arising from the attempts to impose upon us a solution that would enhance those expansionist designs. It is high time for the Cyprus problem to be tackled at its root through the promotion and implementation of the provisions of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  which contain all the necessary elements for solving the basic aspects of the Cyprus problem.There has been a tendency  in the light of the difficulties created by the intransigence of Turkey  either to avoid or to postpone the tackling of the substance of the Cyprus problem. I believe all will agree with me that no problem can be solved by avoiding or postponing the tackling of its substance. The method of avoiding the real issue has not worked. It could not have worked in any case  nor is it fair and realistic to rely for a solution on the weakness of one side and consequently exert pressure on that side instead of pressuring the country that is acting contrary to the principles set forth in the Charter and to the resolutions of the United Nations. Those who can help to find a solution to the Cyprus problem and are in a position to play a significant role in this respect must not limit their interest to determining when the Cyprus problem will be solved but should concentrate rather on how the Cyprus problem should be solved. The time factor is of course important  but far more important is the substance of the solution. Not only must the solution be based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and on the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations  but also it must not be the starting-point for a new Cyprus crisis in the future  worse perhaps than any previous one  with serious consequences beyond Cyprus that may threaten peace and security in the area. This is why the basic aspects of the Cyprus problem and prerequisites of its solution - namely the absolute necessity of the withdrawal of Turkish troops and colonist settlers from Cyprus  the safeguarding in practice of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all the Cypriot people and the ensuring of effective international guarantees for the security and future of the country - must be tackled as a matter of priority  otherwise the present unjust and dangerous situation will continue  to the detriment of Cyprus and its people as a whole  irrespective of ethnic origin. In addition  no one should underestimate the potential danger involved in the perpetuation of the current situation nor should anyone be misled by the fact that there has been no bloodshed for some time.We strongly and sincerely believe that if the basic aspects of the Cyprus problem are settled it will not be at all difficult to reach an overall solution  of the kind that will ensure lasting peace in Cyprus. It is in this spirit that we shall continue in good faith to co-operate with the Secretary-General. And it is in the same spirit that we have proposed the holding of an international conference to deal with the international aspects of the Cyprus problem. When we speak of an international conference we mean in essence a conference of the members of the Security Council for the purpose of promoting the implementation of their own resolutions. The reason we are asking for the convening of an international conference - and I say this in reply to those who object to this proposal - is not to make it easier for any of the big Powers to gain points or advantages/ but because we consider it a realistic approach that would strengthen the role and efforts of both the Security Council and the Secretary-General. I suppose it is for the same reason that there is now such wide agreement on the holding of an international conference on the Middle East situation.I should like now to refer specifically to the presence in Cyprus of the Turkish occupation troops  whose number has risen to about 35 000  and to the colonist settlers from Turkey  whose number is now estimated at about 65 000. Incidentally  when I speak of the colonist settlers  I must say - and I know that representatives have heard of this - that the Turkish Government has often described them as seasonal workers: 65 000 ""seasonal workers""  who have formed their own political party on which the present illegal regime depends; ""seasonal workers"" to whom the land and property of those uprooted from their homes has been distributed; ""seasonal workers"" who have illegally been given citizenship by the illegal regime. But such lies are not unprecedented in the case of Turkey. I would remind representatives that Turkey described the invasion in 1974  13 years ago  as ""a limited police operation"".In addition to the increase in the number of the Turkish occupation troops  there has been a continuous and considerable strengthening of those troops in tetras of military equipment  both quantitatively and qualitatively  and all this despite repeated United Nations resolutions. Turkey is a strong Power and Cyprus is a very small  weak country. The geographic proximity is such that realistically  it means that Cyprus will always live in dangerous conditions. Yet we have offered - and I renewed that offer yesterday during my meeting with the Secretary-General - to dismantle our own defences and dissolve our own National Guard  if all Turkish troops and other personnel  including the settlers from Turkey  are withdrawn from Cyprus  so that he Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots can settle their internal problems in conditions of peace  without foreign interference· Part of my proposal is also the establishment of an international peace force under United Nations auspices  whose imposition and terms of reference would be agreed and endorsed by the Security Council  for the purpose of strengthening the sense of security internally. It goes without saying that  together with the withdrawal of the Turkish troops and settlers  the so-called Turkish Cypriot army must also be dismantled and 3issolved· In fact  ray proposal means the total demilitarisation of the Republic 3f Cyprus  with the exception of the international peace force envisaged in my proposal and a reasonably small mixed local police force.It is of course obvious that in such circumstances sufficient international guarantees must be ensured to protect Cyprus from any outside danger or threat. I urge not only the Secretary-General but all members of the Security Council and of the General Assembly to study this proposal carefully and contribute positively to its adoption and implementation· If Turkey decides to abandon its expansionist designs  no one can see any reason why this practical  pacific  realistic and far-reaching proposal cannot be accepted. This proposal will not only contribute decisively to an overall and lasting solution of the Cyprus problem but also remove a potential threat to peace and security in that dangerous and sensitive area of the world. A similar proposal has been put forward by the Prime Minister of Greece  Mr. Andreas Papandreou  in which  inter alia  he states Greece's readiness to bear a significant part of the financial cost of the international peace force envisaged in the proposal. Cyprus too  despite its limited possibilities  is ready to contribute substantially to meeting the cost.Another request to the Secretary-General which I renewed in the course of our meeting yesterday relates to the specific issue of the city of Varosha. I asked the Secretary-General once again to demand that the occupying Power  Turkey  hand over the city of Varosha to the United Nations for resettlement by its rightful inhabitants  in compliance with the specific provision contained in the Security Council's mandatory resolution 550 (1984). Such a move would improve the climate and constitute a first step in the right direction.During my meeting yesterday with the Secretary-General I also expressed to him my deep anxiety and concern at the fact that despite our efforts and goodwill no progress has yet been made to ascertain the fate of missing persons and urged him to take all the additional steps necessary to tackle without any further delay this purely humanitarian problem. It is inconceivable that Turkey should be permitted to continue to behave in such a negative manner on such an obviously humanitarian issue. Likewise  I stressed once again the need for the protection of those in the enclave of the occupied area of Cyprus and for renewed efforts to implement the relevant agreement reached in Vienna in 1975  which has been systematically violated - like all the other agreements - by the Turkish side.The Cyprus problem is not a dispute between East and West. Yet  I strongly believe that co-operation between the super-Powers  as in the case of other regional problems  as long as that co-operation is based on the United Nations Charter and resolutions  will contribute decisively to a just  viable and workable solution to the Cyprus problem that will ensure lasting peace  freedom  justice and happiness for all the inhabitants of our small country  irrespective of ethnic origin  as well as to peace and security in the area.We hope and trust that the General Assembly - which has been requested to consider the Cyprus problem once again after an interlude of four years marked not only by a lack of any substantive progress but also by a series of new provocative acts by Turkey - will help us in our endeavours  which  after all  are aimed at objectives that are in complete accord with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. But let me stress once again that we do not have the right  nor are we prepared  to abandon those objectives  on the attainment of which the very survival of our people and of Cyprus as an independent and free country entirely depends.It is high time for the international community as a whole  and in particular those that are in the best position to help  to make Turkey feel the need to abandon its expansionist and partitionist designs against Cyprus. It is high time for Turkey to be made to feel that it cannot continue to ignore and disregard the provisions of the United Nations Charter and resolutions. It is high time for Turkey to be made to understand and realize the mandatory and binding nature of Security Council resolutions It is high time for Turkey to be made to feel the need to abide by the rules of international law.We are entering a new era in which it would be unthinkable to permit anyone  irrespective of who it might be  to upset  undermine and sabotage the efforts to achieve peace  security and justice in any part of the world.

"38",1830,"DDR",42,1987,"﻿It gives me much pleasure. Comrade President  to extend to you hearty congratulations on your election to preside over the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session and to wish you every success.We appreciate the judicious work of the President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session I wish good health and energy to the Secretary-General  Mr· Javier Perez de Cuellar  in his responsible post. We very much appreciate that during his visit to the German Democratic Republic last June we had fruitful talks serving the purposes of the United Nations·The forty-second session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when ever more people have come to realize that the conventional posture of States on the political  economic and military issues and their own old habits of dealing with the environment and nature are no longer adequate to guarantee the survival of human civilization.With the world's population now exceeding 5 billion  there is growing evidence that in this age of nuclear weapons and high technology the politics of the arms race and confrontation and the pursuit of selfish interests are bound to multiply and in the end dangerously aggravate the numerous conflicts and crises that already exist in the world. The risks of such policies are becoming increasingly incalculable. This fact alarms peoples on all continents and stirs all those who feel responsible for the fate of humanity to search for alternatives.To assure the future of mankind it is necessary  first and foremost  to avert a nuclear inferno  to agree immediately on a world-wide halt to the arms race  to lead purposefully that halt to a comprehensively controlled process of reduction c forces and armaments; to refrain from militarising outer space; to forgo the deployment of arms and forces in places where there are means to settle peaceful existing conflict; and to promote coexistence among States and peoples and arrange for their co-operation with a view to solving the global issues facing mankind  such as the preservation of the foundations of life on this planet  the eradication of underdevelopment  hunger and disease  and the elimination of living conditions that are incompatible with human dignity.Seven decades ago  immediately after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution  the young Soviet State addressed its Decree of Peace to the world. Amidst the conflagration of the First World War that call was something entirely new  unusual and unique  giving fresh vigour to the yearning for peace. Since those times  the safeguarding of peace and the transition to disarmament have become the main concern of world politics. Chiefly owing to the initiatives taken by the socialist countries  the non-aligned States  the Group of Six and  last but not least  thanks to the activities of the United Nations and the vigorous action of the world-wide peace movement  there is growing awareness that peace in our time can no longer be achieved by arming against each other  but can be ensured only with each other. To give fresh dynamism to the efforts in favour of a secure peace  arms limitation and disarmament requires common sense and realism. To that end all States must live up to their responsibility.At their Berlin summit held last May the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty submitted a comprehensive programme of disarmament which also provides for measures for strict verification and confidence building. That programme is based on the analysis of what is necessary and feasible to build a lasting peace with ever fewer weapons; and it is the logical conclusion from the common Soviet-American perception ""that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought; that any war between the Soviet Union and the United States of America  whether nuclear or conventional  must be prevented. That is what  we recall. General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan stated as a result of their meeting at Geneva in November 1985. It is in this context that the German Democratic Republic appreciates the efforts made and the results achieved in the Soviet-American talks at the foreign-minister level which ended last week and went a long way to bringing the world closer to genuine nuclear disarmament. Pursuant to its objective to secure peace with ever fewer weapons  the German Democratic Republic has used all its possibilities  and will continue to do so  to contribute to bringing about a double-zero solution without ifs and buts.In the view of the German Democratic Republic  the agreed conclusion and theimplementation of an accord between the USSR and the United States of America on the global elimination of their intermediate-range and shorter range missiles permit a start on disarmament proper. Some day historians will certainly describe that step as a turning-point in international and State-to-State relations. It therefore deserves absolute priority and every support. It is only too understandable that now there is a resolute call for the signing and implementing of the accords  because it is common knowledge that  regrettably  there are forces willing to foil this.Along parallel lines  efforts must be intensified to reduce drastically the number of offensive strategic weapons whilst strengthening the anti-ballistic missile Treaty regime and preventing an arms race in outer space. This would also benefit the further strengthening of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). At the same time it is imperative to bring about a world-wide prohibition of chemical weapons and a general and complete ban on nuclear-weapon tests.Threatening potentials and ""nuclear deterrence are not only incompatible with a reasonable code of conduct consistent without nuclear and space area; they are also a highly dangerous anachronism. The strategy of so-called nuclear deterrence by no means creates a greater measure of security  but is rather a stumbling-block to rapid progress on nuclear disarmament. An alternative has been offered by the document on their military doctrine the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty adopted at their Berlin summit. That entirely defensive doctrine is fully consistent with the principles embodied in the United Nations Charter concerning the non-threat or non-use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State. The allied socialist States declare: that they will never in any circumstances initiate military action against any State or alliance of States unless they are themselves the target of an armed attack·  that they will never be the first to employ nuclear weapons; that they have no territorial claims on any other State  either in Europe or outside Europe and that they do not view any State or any people as their enemy.The States parties to the Warsaw Treaty have proposed to the member States of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that they enter into consultations on their respective military doctrines. That  too  could open up a way which would lead finally to a non-offensive capacity on both sides. Military imbalances that have emerged regarding any kind of weapon must be reduced through disarmament by the side that has the advantage over the other  in order to restore the balance at a lower level. That would be better  and less costly  than to stick to the principle of counter-deployment  which in the end has always sent the arms race spiralling upwards.For the socialist States  verification of all agreements on arms limitation and disarmament is indispensable. What they want is verification without loopholes that includes necessary on-site inspections. The German Democratic Republic  situated as it is in the heart of Europe  has been working above all for a lessening of military confrontation and the strengthening of security on the European continent  since any conflict at the divide between the two most powerful military alliances with the highest concentration of destructive potential would be fatal for humanity as a whole. Security must be strengthened there through global and regional efforts. Yet we do not wait for global solutions. Together with the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  the German Democratic Republic has put forward proposals aimed at the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free corridor and a chemical-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Their implementation would not hamper but facilitate global solutions. Likewise  we attach great importance to the proposal made by the highest representative of the Polish People's Republic  Wojciech Jaruzelski.The translation of these initiatives into reality would constitute at the same time a direct contribution to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process  which plays an indisputably essential role in promoting confidence and co-operation in Europe - a role that is increasing  as borne out by the follow-up meeting in Vienna. The German Democratic Republic is working for the successful conclusion of that meeting.Over the years the Helsinki Final Act  that code of peaceful coexistence  has become a solid foundation for State-to-State co-operation in Europe. It was that positive regional experience from the CSCE process that encouraged the socialist States to submit their proposal to create a comprehensive system of international peace and security. We would expect the current session of the General Assembly to build on the exchange of views already begun  to which General Secretary Gorbachev's article of last week made an impressive contribution  and to lead it towards an intensive dialogue about such a system that would include political  military  economic  humanitarian and ecological aspects. That would be in accordance with the mandate which the world Organization must fulfil by virtue of its Charter.For every people peace begins on its own doorstep. For this reason  and because of a well-understood historical responsibility  the overriding issue of a secure peace in our time was the central theme of the visit that Erich Honaker  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic  paid to the Federal Republic of Germany recently. As the leading representative of the German Democratic Republic stated at the end of his visit:""The results and agreements reached are a success for the policy of common sense and realism  they benefit the people and peace.""The most important result of that visit  which is certainly of concern and interest to all States and peoples  was the agreement  as underlined in the joint declaration""that the relations between the two States must remain a stabilizing factor for constructive East-West relations. It should generate positive impulses for peaceful co-operation and dialogue in Europe and beyond.""That remains possible provided the two sides - as they have agreed - proceed strictly from realities  show political will  reason and realism  and continue to normalize their intergovernmental relations. That is the only way to honour the obligation undertaken by the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic f Germany to do everything to ensure that never again will war  but only and always will peace  emanate from German soil - an obligation that the two German States have reaffirmed.That visit has rightly met with a remarkable international response  as its realization reflects the general growing awareness that today one cannot any lone τ have peace for oneself alone and that it is no longer the quantity or quality of weapons that is decisive in ensuring peace  but only the quality of the policies pursued.The visit of the Head of State of the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany illustrated that constructive political dialogue is possible and can indeed be fruitful even when international conditions are complex. Dialogue remains an indispensable tool for mutual understanding and in the search for specific ways to reduce confrontation.Our policy of good-neighbourliness does not leave out Berlin (West). It is based on the quadripartite agreement and thus on the strict observance of the legitimate rights and interests of all concerned.The dangers to world peace arising from seats of tension and conflict are a matter of great concern  since the faintest spark could engender a world-wide flare-up. The German Democratic Republic holds that any dispute or conflict should be brought up and settled at the negotiating table  that is peacefully  through dialogue  with all participants on an equal footing  and on the basis of strict respect for the United Nations Charter. The German Democratic Republic appreciates the relevant efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on behalf of the Security Council. We would expressly encourage him to persist in them. Resolution 598 (1987) of the Security Council is a good basis for the peaceful settlement of the conflict between Iran and Iraq  We endorse the appeal addressed to all States to refrain from any act which might lead to an extension to other regions or to an internationalisation of that conflict. Any show of military strength is incompatible with that aim  as it is bound to exacerbate tensions in the Gulf  The draft declaration entitled ""Enhancement of the effectiveness of the principle of non-use of force in international relations drawn up by the Special Committee  should be adopted at an early date and  above all translated into practical measures.The Middle East conflict remains  now as before  unsettled and the Palestinian people continues to be denied the establishment of an independent and sovereign State; yet there is a growing response to the proposal to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East in which all interested parties would participate  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Direct arrangements by the United Nations Security Council for a negotiating mechanism could bring such a conference nearer. This approach could pave the way to a lasting peace for all States of the region.The German Democratic Republic believes that the implementation by all parties of the Central American peace plan signed in Guatemala on 7 August is an appropriate means of settling the conflicts in Central America peacefully and putting an end to the overt and covert war against Nicaragua·The German Democratic Republic welcomes the initiatives taken by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union for a political settlement of the situation that has developed in the region. The process of national reconciliation which the Afghan Government has initiated must no longer be affected by foreign interference.World public opinion is deeply disturbed about the increased brutality and aggressiveness to which the South African regime of apartheid resorts vis-à-vis the country's black population and the neighbouring States. The peoples in southern Africa demand self-determination and the eradication of racism and apartheid   which means peace at home and a peaceful environment. It is time now that the United Nations plan for the granting of independence to Namibia be implemented.The German Democratic Republic supports the insistence of the summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity on the imposition by the United Nations Security Council of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the regime of dyed-in-the-wool racists in South Africa.A representative international conference on Cyprus  to be held within the framework of the United Nations  is  as before  necessary for the settlement of the Cyprus question. The presence of foreign troops on the island Impedes the search for solutions that might be acceptable to all sides.The German Democratic Republic follows with sympathy the dialogue that is developing between the three States of Indo-China and the States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and hopes that it will be a success.The German Democratic Republic expressly supports the demand for the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  in keeping with its foreign policy of welcoming and promoting all regional initiatives for zones of peace  security and co-operation.With regard to the lessening of tensions on the Korean peninsula  the German Democratic Republic supports the pertinent constructive proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Peace and disarmament  social objectives and the elimination of underdevelopment ate today more closely intertwined than ever before. This  too  was underlined in the document entitled ""On the elimination of underdevelopment and the establishment of a new international economic order"" adopted by the States patties to the Warsaw Treaty at their Berlin summit in May 1987. Is it not alarming to note that every minute 28 children die of hunger and avoidable diseases while in the same span of time - as was the case in 1986 - $US 1.7 million is spent on armaments? The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development held recently furnished ample proof that the continued arms race is the main reason why fewer and fewer funds are provided to alleviate the situation of more and more people who ate socially disadvantaged.We are satisfied to note that the outcome of that Conference has made it abundantly clear that disarmament is the first prerequisite of development. As the Soviet Foreign Minister has convincingly pointed out  the developing countries' indebtedness has an increasingly negative impact on international relations. At their Berlin summit the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty called for a global and just settlement of that problem.The United Nations is an appropriate body to promote the democratization of international economic relations. The German Democratic Republic advocates agreement on mutually acceptable principles which would ensure a predictable operation of the world economy. That is precisely the aim of the initiative proposed by the socialist States to draw up a concept of international economic security. The German Democratic Republic stands for Increased co-operation among States for the implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is guided by the precept that the fundamental human right is  above all  the right to live in peace.The German Democratic Republic promotes the enjoyment of human rights and speaks out firmly against the gross and mass violations of human rights by the practice of apartheid  racial and social discrimination  genocide and fascism.This world Organization has a multitude of issues to resolve that are crucial for the existence and survival of humanity. It is invaluable as a forum for dialogue  negotiation and co-operation. In saying this we do not overlook the fact that its effectiveness and that of all its bodies  the strengthening of its role and authority  the enhancement of its effectiveness  the binding character of its resolutions as well as the implementation of its decisions depend on the co-ordinated co-operation of all its Member States. If that co-operation is lacking  the strength of the United Nations is bound to be limited. Let me assure this Assembly that the German Democratic Republic will do all it can to help carry out the tasks that face this world Organization."
"39",1848,"DEU",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  I offer you sincere congratulations on having been elected to your high office and wish you luck and success in carrying out your responsible task. At the same time I extend my thanks to Foreign Minister Choudhury for his circumspect and successful guidance of the forty-first session of the General Assembly  which ended a few days ago.I also take the opportunity cordially to thank the Secretary-General for his untiring endeavours on behalf and in the interest of our Organization. His latest report gives us confidence and a perspective for the future. As in the past  he can count on our unqualified support. The principal task of the United Nations is to maintain and safeguard peace. We begin this session of the General Assembly with hopeful signs of new thinking in West-East relations and in the field of disarmament. Yet the world is still filled with war: war between countries  in which people suffer and die; man waging war on man  for where human rights are violated war is being conducted against man; global terrorism is waging war against order in every form; deadly diseases are waging war on life; mankind is waging war on nature; and what is the hunger and poverty suffered by many nations but the outcome of war on human dignity through man's failure in North and South? In the final analysis  it is always man who threatens man. Our children cannot be blamed for the state of the world  but it is they who suffer most. They expect us to give them a world free from war  free from expulsion  free from fear  free from hunger and disease. Parents all over the world love their children. But ate we in the United Nations really doing enough to protect the rights and the future of our children? We want to leave our children a better world  a world in which human dignity and social justice are guaranteed  in which peace prevails and in which the natural foundations of life are protected and cultivated.But  above all  we must fight against the war inside us as well as that outside us. Peace begins within ourselves; it begins in the mind  with respect for our neighbour and awareness of our responsibility for that neighbour and for all who will come after us.War strategies must be superseded by peace strategies. We want peace in a comprehensive sense. If we fail in our task  none of us will survive. Hence  the crucial task today is to ensure the survival of mankind. Mankind has become a community in pursuit of survival. No one can steal away from our common fate. A nuclear war would destroy us all.Contaminated rivers  seas and soil  desertification  dying forests - especially tropical forests - and the widening hole in the ozone layer are all problems that affect and concern us all.A few weeks ago the world population passed the 5 billion mark. If the present demographic trend continues the world community will number more than 6 billion by the turn of the century. Our children will live to see that day. If we do not act the world's problems will pass beyond our control solely as the result of population growth. Now is the time to set the right course. This is the responsibility of every civilization  every religion  every ideology and every political and social system.The call must be; fight the wars that threaten mankind from all sides. The peace we need is more than the elimination of military conflicts. It implies common responsibility  solidarity and respect for our neighbours. Peace implies making our world human. It implies respecting our natural environment. It implies securing freedom  life and the survival of mankind.Many people live in poverty  exposed to hunger  ignorance and disease. The prospects for the third world depress us all. Commodity prices are falling. This means that developing countries must continuously increase production  and this in turn reduces prices still further.In the industrial countries  however  demand is on the wane because markets for certain commodities are satiated and other commodities are increasingly being replaced by new materials. The disintegration of commodity prices is not a temporary market fluctuation  it is a long-term trend. For most developing countries  however  commodities are still the principal - indeed  in many cases  the only - source of income. Thus their one-sided dependence on commodity exports must be reduced. We must help them to turn their raw materials into manufactures and semi-manufactures of their own. But the diversification of an economy takes time. Until that point is reached  ways and means must be sought of improving existing arrangements  as in the case of the European Community's Community model for off-setting shortfalls in export earnings.Last year the indebtedness of the third world rose by 9 per cent  to l trillion. In 1986 over 30 per cent  and in some cases nearly 50 per cent of the income of 22 sub-Saharan countries was mortgaged for debt service. The debt problem threatens to explode. It is a threat to the economic  social and political future of many heavily indebted countries  but it also poses a threat to donors. It threatens to undermine the will of North and South to co-operate with one another.All those concerned  whether in the public or the private sector  need to increase their efforts. Every country should be treated according to its special circumstances. But the general principle must be to make debt-servicing reasonably proportionate to a country's productive capacity. It is in the true interest of donors to seek in their negotiations with debtors to solutions that will provide a perspective for the future. Hopelessness will crush the best will in the world.Since 1978 the Federal Republic of Germany has remitted 4 2 billion marks of the debt owed it by the poorest countries. I appeal to all donor countries to follow suit  and I appeal to the socialist countries of the North also to provide adequate development aid  at long last.Proceeding from future-oriented reform programmes and financed by new loans on easy terms  the economies of the debtor countries must be put back on a course of growth. But diversification and investment in growth sectors will be helpful to developing countries only if the industrialized world opens its markets wide to their manufactures and semi-manufactures and adapts its own economic structure to such new conditions. We are prepared to make that adjustment.To restrict the role of the developing countries in the world economy to that of mere suppliers of raw materials and energy would be to deprive them of their prospects for the future. The industrial countries must eliminate import restrictions and other barriers to trade. They must stop subsidizing branches of industry that no longer pay their way.They must also reduce agricultural surpluses. The adjustments necessary in the industrial countries are difficult and painful but that can be no reason to keep putting them off. At any rate  exports of weapons are not the solution to these problems. On the contrary  they Increase tensions and the danger of war  and they squander resources that are needed for works of peace. Weapon exports facilitate neither the necessary structural change in the industrial countries nor the process of economic recovery in the developing countries.At its seventh session  the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) underscored the special significance of peaceful international trade for development. The final act of that Conference indicates the strategies that need to be pursued with regard to finance and indebtedness and trade and commodities  and with regard to the problems of the land-locked developing countries. Now is the time for action.The industrial countries are undergoing a technological revolution  a revolution that will completely change society. At the moment we have but little idea of the repercussions it will have on the developing countries. Whatever happens  it must not be allowed to divide the world for ever into rich and poor. We cannot allow the great human dream that has inspired all nations  the dream of one just  peaceful and free world  to be outstripped by technological development. On the contrary  science and technology must be the powerhouse for the development of mankind. Only modern science and technology are capable of solving the world's problems of food supply  health  education and energy. Genetic engineering  modern medical research  state-of-the-art information technologies and new forms of energy must be pooled to this end.AIDS (acquired immune-deficiency syndrome) is a challenge to the whole of mankind. It threatens all nations. My Government is pleased to note that the gravity of this problem is increasingly recognized by Governments and by international organizations.Advanced technology not only provides opportunities; it also entails risks. Chernobyl has demonstrated to the world that the safety of nuclear power stations is the common responsibility of all countries producing nuclear energy. A progressive human society cannot regard nuclear energy as the ultimate solution to the world's energy problems.The task of eliminating the political  social and moral risks inherent in high technology and science is common to the whole human race.Genetic engineering can secure adequate food supplies for many billions of people  but it can also be abused to violate the dignity of man if it is used solely as a means of manipulating man  if it encroaches upon each person's individuality. The United Nations is the forum where the best brains in our countries can establish common ethical standards with which to measure the consequences of technological development.The earth's atmosphere and its high seas are the common property of mankind. They have to be preserved so that the human species can survive. But  like the world's climate  they too are being jeopardized. The Brundtland report has presented a plan for development that is both lasting and environmentally compatible  and it must be taken seriously. The world must be made more acutely aware of these issues and interactions. This is a matter for the United Nations. We should soon consider proclaiming a year of global environmental protection. We should also consider proclaiming the 199Os a decade for the environment to provide the necessary stimulus worldwide.Everywhere we face problems which we can only solve together or not at all. We have long since entered an age of global domestic policy in which each one of us is dependent upon everyone else. Thus  the importance of the United Nations grows from year to year. It is our common duty to preserve and develop the world Organization. The gap between the concept of the United Nations and its present indateriali2ation in a world of nation-States is still considerable. We must all learn to find global answers to global problems. The United Nations offers a wide range of instruments for this purpose. The more determined our efforts to reform the world Organization  the more effectively will be able to use those instruments. I wish at this juncture to thank the Secretary-General for his far-sighted approach to this problem.Many forms of co-operation can also develop in a smaller framework. Here in lies the special significance of regional organizations. The European Community has shown the world the kind of dynamism for peace that can emanate from regional organizations. For centuries the nation-States of Europe fought one another in wars  which also spread beyond their continent to other parts of the world. Today  war among the 12 members of the European Community is impossible; it is inconceivable.That is the first and most important task of a regional organization: to make sure that war in its region will be impossible. The more nation-States become integrated the better their chances of achieving that aim. That is why my Government strongly supports all efforts to establish peace in crisis areas originating in the region itself. We welcome the signing of the Arias Plan by five Central American countries as a step towards peace and stability in Central America and encourage them on that road. The result of the Guatemala conference is a sign of hope. We give our unqualified support to the nations of Central America in their efforts to secure social justice  to ensure the application of the principles of democracy  to secure independence and to foster peace and co-operation. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is helping the cause of world peace by encouraging co-operation between the European Community and the regional organizations in Central and South America  Asia  the Middle East and Africa.The countries of one region can best preserve and develop their cultural identity through joint efforts. The wealth inherent in cultural diversity is the purest source of energy for man's task of safeguarding peace. All nations on earth are  without distinction  civilized nations. Their cultural contribution is indispensable for the creation of a single global society based on justice  peace and freedom. We are serving the cause of peace if we preserve and protect the unmistakable identities of these civilizations. Nations that respect the cultural achievements of other nations cannot be stirred up against one another. Cultural arrogance has time and again been the root cause of catastrophes.Thus the North-South dialogue  too  needs a cultural dimension. Only if nations start from the basis of their individual culture and cultural exchanges and partnerships with others can they develop the national consciousness that will help solve mankind's common problems.Regional organizations in the third world are the best way to ensure that their members are not drawn into the West-East confrontation. This is also the great mission of the Non-Aligned Movement  which is a growing factor of stability in the world. Genuine non-alignment offers third-world countries in particular a great opportunity to preserve their identity and consolidate their Independence.We are all aware of the magnitude of the world's problems. This being so  we know we cannot solve political  social  religious and ideological differences in one gigantic leap. These differences exist and we have to live with them. But that should not stop us  notwithstanding all the differences of principle and ideology  from doing what we can to safeguard world peace now.There is a growing awareness of this. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  like last year's special session of the General Assembly on Africa  has given encouraging signs that North and South are capable of disregarding positions of principle and concentrating on what is necessary and feasible at the present time.We must now take this opportunity to move forward. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) is an encouraging sign of common responsibility for global peace. The special significance of that resolution lies in its unanimous adoption. It can serve as an example for the settlement of other regional conflicts as well.We strongly support resolution 598 (1987) and the Secretary-General's efforts to establish peace on its basis. That resolution affords Iraq and Iran an opportunity to embark on the road of peace. With Iraq having stated its approval  I urgently appeal to Iran to implement the resolution fully.War has been going on in Afghanistan  too  for nearly eight years now. We expect the Soviet Union to withdraw its forces from that country and put an end to the suffering of the Afghan people. No one apart from the afflicted people of Afghanistan should gain advantage from the Soviet withdrawal. Consequently  the conditions for the genuine independence and non-alignment of the new Afghanistan must be established now.We also call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea so that this country may exercise its right to self-determination. The new  fundamental developments between West and East with their far-reading consequences for world peace have only become possible through both sides opting for co-operation. The clearest manifestation of that willingness are the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union aimed at the global elimination of their intermediate-range nuclear missiles. For the first time  agreements are being made between West and East which not only limit but actually remove arms. This marks a turning-point in history.We Germans greatly encouraged this development and we welcome the result - this great agreement - with relief. It enhances security and stability in Europe. My Government has viewed its role in this process not merely as that of an interested spectator. We have played an active part in achieving this success as a country aware of its responsibility for peace. Through our advocacy of the ""double-zero solution"" we have paved the way for the world-wide elimination of intermediate-range missiles.I endorse the statement Chancellor Kohl made on this subject on 26 August 1987 that  by the time the American and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear forces have been removed as agreed  the German Pershing la systems will also have been phased out.This agreement is still a long way from completely solving the problem of nuclear disarmament  but it represents the first  and thus the crucial  step towards the great objective to which the nuclear Powers committed themselves before the world in the nuclear-test-ban Treaty.A process has been set in motion which must be made irreversible. Further steps must  and will  follow. We deem it essential that the United States and the Soviet Union should now concentrate on a drastic reduction of all strategic offensive weapons and in so doing also consider the further application of the Treaty on anti-ballistic missiles (ABM).In the Western Alliance we will move ahead with the preparations for negotiations on nuclear missiles with a range of less than 500 kilometres. We will vigorously pursue the negotiations on conventional stability in Europe. The statements issued by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact afford a good basis for such negotiations. A convention globally banning chemical weapons is overdue. That convention must now be concluded  We cannot permit an ever larger number of countries to manufacture or produce these ghastly weapons of destruction. The best protection against their proliferation is their global elimination and their global prohibition. In our efforts to achieve that aim  we are not facing an insurmountable wall. New thinking that stems from the knowledge that we can only survive with one another  not against one another  governs oar actions more and more· Ho nation can have a greater interest in the success of all these negotiations than that of the Germans  for most weapon systems are concentrated in their country - on both sides of the dividing line - so they would be the first to be threatened with extinction·The agreement on intermediate-range nuclear force© will provide the spark the effects of which will be carried well beyond the confines of arms control. Both sides will draw from that agreement the energy and the confidence to extend their co-operation to all fields where such co-operation is currently possible. That will be a major step towards the political objective of Atlantic defensive community  which is to establish solid structures for peace in Europe through co-operation between West and East in all areas and on the basis of a reliable defence capability.The fact that we can cherish this hope today in the result of the discernment and the constructive approach of both sides that had already become clear at the summit meeting of the United States and the Soviet Union in Reykjavik. There  the two super-Powers showed that they are conscious of their responsibility for mankind's survival· in this they deserve the support of all peace-loving people. We must not stray from this path. ·The signposts to a better future are not the prejudices and enemy-images of yesterday but the will of nations  the will of every individual  to live in peace and dignity. Only in that manner shall we fulfil our responsibility for the future of mankind.The era that was dominated by hegemonic aspirations  the era in which the world risked being pulled into the vortex of a never-ending arms race  is drawing to a close. This process cannot be stopped} it is paving the way to a better world. In such a· world there can no longer be any room for the old enemy-images. If we dismantle our weapons we must also dismantle those enemy-images. On a global scale and in Europe we must create reliable systems for maintaining security on a co-operative basis  as well as mechanisms for the early detection and management of crises. The Federal Republic of Germany will assist in this task in the North Atlantic alliance and in the European Community. We shall do everything in our power to promote the process of European union and to strengthen our alliance  the aim of which is to prevent war.Our desire to achieve the union of the twelve European democracies  our desire for co-operation with our Eastern neighbours  is a manifestation of the policy of the Federal Republic of Germany for peace in Europe. We are aware of our responsibility  we shall use all our energy and every opportunity in working for a better Europe  a Europe based on peace.The position of the twelve members of the European Community of international issues and on the Community's internal development was presented by the Danish Foreign Minister two days ago. The Single European Act  which entered into force on 1 July this year  is significant for the international community. The Twelve wish  as is stated in the preamble to the Act  to make together ""their own contribution to the preservation of international peace and security in accordance with the undertaking entered into by them within the framework of the United Nations Charter"".To that end we intend to establish a common Community foreign policy. The completion of the European internal market  scheduled for 1992  will greatly increase the Community's strength. Significant steps towards a common monetary policy and towards the aim of converging the economic and financial policies of its members will have to follow  as will steps towards the creation of a technological community. That is the road to European union. To our neighbours in the East we extend the hand of wide-ranging co-operation - envisaged in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Securityand Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) as the course towards the establishment of a peaceful order in Europe. At the CSCE follow-up conference in Vienna we are not merely seeking progress in matters of security: we are also seeking progress on the realization of human rights  on humanitarian issues  on economic exchanges  on the exchange of science and technology  on the exchange of information and culture. West and East can give each other a great deal through co-operation through confrontation they can deprive themselves of progress entirely - they can lose everything. Through co-operation we seek to build confidence  to serve mutual interests and  in a positive sense  to create dependencies that will make peace and co-operation irreversible.We do not want to bleed one another to death through the arms race  nor do we want to cripple anyone economically. The political and military division of Europe is bad enough. We must not divide Europe economically and technologically when there are already gulfs to be filled and walls to be climbed. Our aim is to help achieve genuine progress in all fields. If the Soviet Union opens up to the world it will find a reliable and constructive partner in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Treaty of Moscow affords a basis for such co-operation as well as the necessary perspective. We shall have recourse to that Treaty  aware of the central importance of German-Soviet relations  which have an impact on the situation in the whole of Europe beyond their bilateral relationship.If  after decades of confrontation  it were possible today to reach a turning point in the East-West relationship it would be a mistake of historic dimensions if we were to let the opportunity pass. All must shoulder their responsibility. Twelve years after the signing of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) we can declare: a process has been set in motion leading to a peaceful order in Europe. My country has made substantial contributions towards this goal through its accession to the European Community and the Western defensive alliance and through the unprecedented Franco-German partnership.We have cleared the way for a new West-East relationship by means of the Treaty of Moscow; the Treaty of Warsaw  which established the basis for a new beginning with the Polish People's Republic in the awareness of the special quality of the German-Polish relationship following the vicissitudes of their history; and also through the treaty with Czechoslovakia and the Basic Treaty on Relations with the German Democratic Republic.Not only is there no feasible alternative  there is no responsible alternative to this process. We always perceive Europe as a whole; we want to improve the situation in the whole of Europe. We realize that the wheel of history can never be turned back  only forward.Part of this perspective for Europe's future is the relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the other German State  the German Democratic Republic. Both States are firmly integrated in their respective alliances. But precisely this fact makes it possible for them to campaign in their alliances for co-operation throughout Europe. The differences in their two value-systems are fundamental. Nevertheless the two German States are agreed: never again must war originate on German soil  only peace.There is still disagreement between the two German states as to the future of the German nation. The Federal Republic of Germany remains committed to its aim of working for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will regain its unity through free self-determination.The visit to the Federal Republic of Germany by Mr. Erich Honaker  Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic  demonstrated the intention of both German States to render a major contribution to stability in Europe by improving the quality of their relations and through their efforts to promote disarmament. Through these efforts we are also serving the welfare and interests of the people.Mr. Honaker's visit revealed not only fundamental differences but also a willingness to co-operate with one another. We Germans  too  must live with the disparities that characterize the world  and above all Europe  even though they affect us more than other nations. But these disparities must not prevent us Members of this great world Organization from meeting our responsibility for peace and the survival of mankind.Common international responsibility also means a common responsibility to combat terrorism  to combat racism and to prevent violations of human rights. Today  now  this must be the great common denominator for all nations who have committed themselves to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The community of nations' are becoming increasingly aware that terrorism is a threat not only to political enemies but also to one's own country. We can confront terrorism only if its perpetrators are unable to find refuge anywhere in the world. But we shall be able to rid ourselves of terrorism for good only if we also remove its causes  and there are many.The Middle East crisis  for instance  may keep on spawning violence. Consequently  peace must at long last be established in Lebanon on the basis of freedom  sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Middle East conflict  as we have seen in the course of past years  cannot be settled by force  only by negotiation. We therefore advocate an international conference on the Middle East  which must proceed from Israel's right to exist within recognized and secure borders and from the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people.If terrorism is inimical to any order  racism is the most terrible deprecation of human dignity. A regime that rules in the name of race must be opposed by the conscience of the world in the name of humanity. The Western democracies are a community oriented to common values and based on equal dignity for all. In view of this  we condemn the violation and mockery of human rights in the Republic of South Africa. We call upon the South African Government to create at last the conditions that will enable black and white to meet at the conference table and commence the dialogue that is so urgently needed. Apartheid must be totally eradicated; it is not capable of reform.The state of emergency must be lifted  the political prisoners  first among them Nelson Mandela  must be released unconditionally and the banned organizations of the black majority must be allowed to operate again. If this is done  there is still hope that the violence that is bound to keep on producing yet more violence can be stopped. With regard to Namibia  we demand the application  at long last  of resolution 435 (1978)  without any ifs and buts.We condemn violations of human rights wherever they occur. A particularly horrific aberration of State authority is torture. It is not an instrument with which to fight one's political opponents. Least of all it is a means of administering justice. It is the most abhorrent and barbaric manifestation of injustice. By means of the United Nations Convention against torture  the world has taken a big step forward in the development of its political culture. By virtue of its Charter  by virtue of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the human rights covenants and its human rights institutions  the United Nations is a citadel and a bulwark of human rights. The exercise of civil  economic and social human rights is essential in the construction of a better world. A high commissioner for human rights and a court of human rights would be able to protect and promote these rights.Only on human tights and the right of self-determination of nations can the universal house of peace be built. They are its foundations. That is why my country reaffirms to everyone before this world Assembly its pledge to respect every nation's right  to self-determination and to defend human rights all over the globe.And with the same earnestness we pledge ourselves  by dint of our policy of peace at home and abroad aimed at developing peaceful relations with our neighbours and all nations on earth and at making peace with nature  to safeguard life on this planet and the survival of mankind for this and all future generations.Only when there is life is there freedom and human dignity. To preserve it must be the aim of our Organization. "

I am convinced that your vast knowledge and experience will ensure the success of our deliberations. My delegation will spare no effort in making its modest contribution to the performance of your task.I am also happy to convey the appreciation and gratitude of my delegation to your predecessor Mr. Choudhury  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  who demonstrated ability and devotion in the performance of his duties as president of the General Assembly at its last session.It also gives me pleasure to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the tireless efforts he has made in promoting co-operation and understanding among nations.The economic situation of Africa has become very alarming. It has been marked  inter alia  by a reduction in the gross domestic product  a drop in export earnings  a drop in income  and a high rate of population growth. At a time when the African countries most need it for implementing their recovery programme  we are witnessing a net drain of capital from the developing countries to the developed countries. Many African countries  especially those of sub-Saharan Africa  are facing debts that considerably hamper their development. Inadequate social services in such areas as health  sanitation  education and housing have become sources of constant concern in these countries. The tragic consequences of drought have been exacerbated also by the large number of refugees and displaced persons.All these factors jeopardize economic  social and political stability and undermine the economic reforms that Africa has undertaken since the adoption in 1585 of Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 198Ь-19У0 and the adoption by the General Assembly in 1986 of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-199U. The outlook for increased investment in development projects has become far worse.African countries have undertaken a long-term programme of economic and social development to deal with that economic situation. We are convinced that the international community will support the programmes for the recovery and economic development of Africa  since African economies must achieve a higher growth-rate so that Africa can reverse the current trend and overcome its underdevelopment.It goes without saying that African countries must promote inter-regional co-operation in all the spheres deemed necessary for improving their economic and social situation in conformity with the Lagos Plan of Action and Final Act.In this connection  it should be noted that the countries of east Africa - Ethiopia  Kenya  Somalia  Sudan  Uganda and Djibouti - have combined their efforts to confront the adverse effects of drought and other related natural disasters  and have established the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development. Those countries have adopted a plan of action for financing specific sectoral programmes and well-defined projects necessary to strengthen their national and regional capability to combat the effects of drought and promote economic and social development. We believe that these pro9rammes can be successful only with the total support of the international community.I wish to inform the General Assembly that the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development held its first conference of donors in Djibouti in March 1987. At that conference the donor countries. United Nations specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations recognized the serious work done by the	·Authority in submitting to them coherent programmes and projects in keeping with Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990. The international community showed interest in these projects  which related to food security  water resources  combating desertification  agronomic research and infrastructures.I take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to all Member States  agencies and organizations that have contributed and given their assistance at this difficult time  when the countries members of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development are trying to mobilize the necessary financial  material and technical resources.The nations of the Horn of Africa have always worked to promote regional co-operation. We believe that the establishment of regional intergovernmental organizations will help to create conditions conducive to tolerance and good-neighbourliness  thus making possible the development of real co-operation in commercial and cultural exchanges. Such co-operation can help to establish a climate of mutual trust that will enhance the well-being of the peoples of the region.The Republic of Djibouti is situated it one of the most arid regions of the world. The scarcity of rainfall and other adverse climatic conditions continue to be the main obstacles to development and self-sufficiency in food. Poor agriculture and livestock production have made Djibouti a net importer  at extremely high prices  of nearly all the food needed for local consumption.Industry is practically non-existent  owing mainly to the high cost of the electricity available. The Government of Djibouti has given high priority to the development of new and renewable sources of energy that could form the basis for viable industrial development  and in particular to exploration for and exploitation of the geothermal energy that we believe exists in sufficient quantity to meet a substantial part of the country's energy needs in the near future. But exploitation of geothermal energy requires technology  capital investment and qualified professionals  which at present we lack.Nevertheless  the development and expansion of the service sector  which is now the basis of our national economy  must be maintained. However  the maintenance of this sector at a viable level requires structural adjustment  the training of a work-force and major financial resources.In addition to these difficulties  the Republic of Djibouti must deal with the precarious economic and financial situation resulting from several adverse factors caused by the foreign debt  inflation and unemployment. The repercussions of the last drought and the presence of a large number of refugees are a heavy burden on the State budget.In the light of these social and economic difficulties  my Government hopes that Member States and international agencies and organizations will provide Djibouti with the assistance needed to support its efforts and enable it successfully to carry out its development programme. The situation in the Middle  East continues to be the most worrying threat to international peace and security. Israel  which is pursuing an expansionist policy  has constantly defied international public opinion and spurned the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  the provisions of the  Charter and the principles of international law  which state that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible. According to Israel  the solution of the Middle East problem is not a just and lasting peace  but rather expansion and the acquisition of territory to the detriment of its neighbours  and the denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.Ever since its creation Israel has shown by its actions that it will not give up the expansionist goals set by the Zionists. Since the creation of the State of Israel by the adoption of General Assembly resolution (II)  of 29 November 1947  the Zionist regime has waged a campaign of terror  involving massacres of the civilian population  including women and children  and resulting in a massive exodus of Palestinians. Thus  terrorism has been introduced in our time into the Middle East as a means of achieving political goals. Since 194b Israeli acts of aggression have caused several armed conflicts that have endangered international peace and security.The Palestinian- question is at the core of the Middle East conflict. There can be no solution without taking account of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people. That crucial fact was stressed in the Arab peace plan adopted at the Fez summit conference. The international community has stated on many occasions that the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the total  unconditional withdrawal of Israel from Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem  are the essential elements of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The international conference On peace in the Middle East  which should be convened in accordance with General Assembly resolution 38/58 C  under United Nations auspices and with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  would be the most appropriate forum for establishing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.We commend the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to speed up the preparations for the conference and hope he will overcome all the obstacles in the way of his initiatives. Israeli intervention in Lebanon  the unjustified massacre of civilians and the destruction of property continue to worsen Lebanon's economic and social structure which has already been seriously affected by internal conflict. Under the pretext of the so-called buffer zone  Israel continues to occupy southern Lebanon to impede the process of national unity and the country's reconstruction. We call upon the United Nations to ensure implementation of Security Council resolution 5U9 {1982) and to assist Lebanon to regain sovereignty over its entire territory in order to undertake the difficult task of reconstruction and recovery.Notwithstanding resolutions of the United Nations  the OAU and the Non-Aligned Movement  as well as world public opinion  the South African regime continues to intensify its oppressive practices through acts of violence  intimidation and massacres perpetrated against the black majority. However  South Africa's campaign of terror  police brutality and violence will only strengthen further the resolve of those fighting for their freedom and national independence.We express profound concern at the lack of progress in negotiations to find a solution to the problem of the political  economic and social emancipation or the African black majority at a time when atrocities perpetrated against the South African people by the apartheid regime still continue.We believe that in the circumstances the only way to force the apartheid regime to negotiate is through concerted specific international pressure and the immediate imposition of comprehensive sanctions. There will be no peace and tranquillity in that region so long as the apartheid system has not been totally dismantled and destroyed  and all international efforts likely to disable that regime's repressive machinery must be supported of all peace-loving countries. International action must also support the efforts of the South African majority to end racism and racial discrimination and eliminate the repressive policy of the Pretoria regime. The illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa and the latter’s refusal to recognize the rights of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence despite United Nations resolutions  are a serious source of concern. As long as the Pretoria regime continues to occupy Namibia  as long as military and police repression are used to subjugate the Namibian people  and as long as the apartheid system plunders the enormous natural and mineral resources of the Territory in the interest of the minority and foreign allies  peace in that region will be jeopardized.The acts of violence committed by the forces of apartheid have gone beyond the borders of Namibia and South Africa. Indeed  a few moments ago the Head of State of Zambia and current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) referred to the latest events that have occurred in that region. The Pretoria regime has many times perpetrated acts of aggression against the independent front-line States to destabilize and disorganize them. In view of that situation  the front-line States need proper political  material and financial support to enable them to defend themselves against South Africa's repeated attacks.Any negotiations seeking to find a political solution to the problem of Namibia should lead to a complete cease-fire followed by the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the South African occupation forces from that Territory  so that the Namibian people can exercise their inalienable rights to self-determination and independence  in keeping with the United Nations plan approved in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which is the genuine basis for finding solutions leading to peaceful independence for Namibia.The international community must give the Namibian people every necessary assistance to deal with South African aggression to enable it to win its legitimate struggle for freedom and independence  under the wise guidance of the South West Africa People's Organization.For seven years and a few days now a destructive conflict has been going on between Iran and Iraq  two Muslim neighbouring countries - a conflict which  according to some estimates  has resulted in a million dead and wounded and incalculable material damage. The conflict is now taking on dangerous dimensions  including the risk of its becoming internationalised. Aware of those developments  the international community adopted practical measures contained in Security Council resolution 598 (1987) of 20 July 1987 in an attempt to end the conflict.Unfortunately  the carnage and destruction continue to be intensified either through bombing civilian centres or endangering international snipping. We urge the international community to increase its efforts and take the necessary steps to end that conflict. All initiatives undertaken bilaterally and multi laterally must be pursued to bring about genuine peace between the two countries. The recent efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General must be supported so that the two countries can agree to negotiate on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) of 20 July 1987. We greatly appreciate Iraq's positive response to find a negotiated solution to the conflict.The mediation process undertaken by the Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State of the OAU to find a solution to the Chadian problem deserves support. We must support all efforts likely to lead to peace and security in that region. The international community must give every assistance to the people and the Government of Chad in their reconstruction effort.For almost eight years now the Afghan people has been suffering from occupation by foreign armed forces and several millions of them have been forced into exile to escape massacre. That situation requires an urgent political solution on the basis of the principles of the Charter and the obligation of States to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty and-territorial  integrity of any State. The international community's repeated appeals for the withdrawal of foreign troops  have still not been headed.  The international community must redouble its efforts to relieve the suffering of the Afghan people by guaranteeing the withdrawal of foreign forces to enable that people freely to choose its political  economic and social systems without any foreign.· interference.  South-East Asia is another region of tension since the foreign armed intervention against and occupation of Democratic Kampuchea. We hope that peace will be restored to that region by finding a just political solution to the Kampuchean problem and guaranteeing the withdrawal of all foreign forces  thus enabling that country to enjoy its sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status.In the Korean Peninsula  since the start of the conflict in the early 1950s  the situation has been a permanent source of tension. The only way to lessen tension is to create the necessary conditions to enable the peoples of South and North Korea to establish a dialogue making possible the establishment of a climate of mutual trust so as to resolve differences without any foreign interference.We are living in a world where interdependence has increasingly become an absolute necessity  we note with satisfaction the efforts undertaken by the United Nations to encourage the developed and the developing nations to co-operate to establish a new just equitable international order. The United Nations promotes understanding and co-operation in the broadest meaning of those words. The United Nations must redouble its efforts to find solutions to eliminate abject poverty  hunger  malnutrition and disease.In conclusion we firmly believe in the United Nations for the safeguard of international peace and security. We reiterate our support for the noble ideals embodied by the United Nations  for it offers the best forum for finding solutions likely to lead to understanding  tolerance and co-operation in international relations."
"41",1951,"DNK",42,1987,"﻿Sir  on behalf of the European Community and its member States I take pleasure in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this forty-second session I should like also to express the Community's appreciation to your predecessor for the leadership shown by him on so many occasions during the past year.The 12 States members of the European Community wish also to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General and to express our deep appreciation of his patient and tireless efforts to solve the problems facing us  including those within this very Organization.I last had the honour to address the General Assembly on behalf of the European Community and its member States in 1982. At that time  I began with words that vividly reflected the difficulties we then faced:""The world today presents a bleak picture. It is becoming Increasingly difficult to remain optimistic about the future."" (A/37/PV.8>pp.18-20)How does the situation look today  five years later? X am happy to say that in the period since I last addressed the General Assembly  there have been a number of encouraging developments. Fortunately  the worst fears expressed at that time have not been realized  and there are grounds for looking to the future with guarded optimism. Difficulties remain in many parts of the world  but it should be noted that international tension has to some extent been reduced as a result of improving relations between East and West.Numerous challenges remain  however. And the United Nations continues to have a central role to play in meeting them. It is striking how the United Nations is now seen as having a major role in finding acceptable solutions to so many of the serious international conflicts that face us - Afghanistan  the Iraq-Iran war  the Arab-Israeli conflict  Lebanon  Cyprus  Kampuchea and southern Africa. After a period in which the United Nations was too often seen as marginal to the great issues of the day  the Twelve welcome the Organization's increasingly central and active role.The 12 States members of the European Community are willing to contribute fully and constructively to the efforts being made by the Secretary-General  the Security Council and this Assembly. It is important that all the nations of the world should work together as truly United nations. The French philosopher Pascal once wrote;""Plurality which is not reduced to unity is confusion  unity which does notdepend on plurality is tyranny.""Let us all try in the coming months  here in New York  to work together and to settle our differences in a constructive and far-sighted atmosphere. This is what the many millions of people whom we represent expect of us.We live in a world of interdependence - a world in which few  if any  major problems can be resolved by one nation alone. The very existence of the European Community reflects the Twelve's acknowledgement of this fact. Our collective efforts to meet the challenges facing Western Europe in the past 30 years highlight our fundamental commitment to international co-operation and collaboration. Since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957  the Community has faced difficulties and disagreements. It has taken time to develop the habits of instinctive partnership among the European Community's member States. But we are in no doubt about the benefits that our peoples have enjoyed as a result of the creation of the European Community. With the entry into force of the Single· European Act this year the European Community has entered into a new phase of close collaboration. Our own experiences have made us all the more convinced that such regional co-operation within the wide global framework is essential if lasting solutions are to be found to the world's problems.The Twelve naturally attach particular importance to the development of East-West relations. As Europeans  we cannot ignore the artificial barriers that divide our continent  and have for over 40 years. The Helsinki Final Act laid a solid foundation for overcoming those barriers. Unfortunately  much still remains to be done adequately to translate the provisions of the Final Act into reality. The Twelve have played a central role in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process since its inception  and we are determined to press for continuing progress. The commitments freely entered into in Helsinki and elsewhere must be fully implemented by all States participating in the CSCE. Their peoples must be able to enjoy the real benefits  including  in particular  respect for human rights  which they were promised in 1975.At the current follow-up meeting in Vienna the Twelve have therefore submitted major proposals within the main areas of the CSCE process  especially concerning its human dimension. We wish  in particular  to increase the impact of the CSCE for individual Europeans by facilitating contacts between East and West  by creating and strengthening guarantees of individual rights and freedoms and by ensuring the free flow of information  ideas and people. Our ideals and proposals must be adequately reflected in any concluding document of the Vienna meeting. That document would thus promote full compliance with existing commitments and represent substantial and balanced progress across the full range of CSCE subjects. The CSCE process cannot stand still  it must be dynamic and responsive to the needs and wishes of our citizens.We are following carefully recent developments in the Soviet Union. We note with interest that new words have been used by the Soviet Union that could point towards a more open society. Improved mutual awareness and understanding between States are both desirable in themselves and have a crucial role to play in reducing mistrust and fear.However  we look to the Soviet Union for deeds that will match its words. Afghanistan is a case in point. Soviet policy in Afghanistan is a concrete test of the Soviet Union's goodwill and intentions. More than 110 000 Soviet troops remain in Afghanistan against the will of the Afghan people. Seven years of indiscriminate warfare have brought immense suffering upon the civilian population  created the world's biggest refugee problem and imposed considerable burdens on neighbouring countries  in particular Pakistan.As expressed in the annual resolutions overwhelmingly endorsed by the Assembly  the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan continues to be as unacceptable to the international community as was the case in 1979š The rapid and unconditional withdrawal of all Soviet troops according to an irrevocable timetable and respect for the legitimate right of the Afghan people to decide freely their own future and system of government are the key elements in a lasting peaceful solution. The Twelve support the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to bring about an early negotiated settlement based on the principles contained in United Nations resolutions.The Twelve welcome improved relations between the super-Powers and  in particular  indications that agreement is near on the global elimination of land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles with a range of between 500 and 5 500 kilometres. This would be a major achievement. The Twelve hope that such an agreement would help to reduce tensions and enhance international security. The Twelve also hope that success in negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces will give a new impetus to United States-Soviet negotiations on other nuclear-missile and space systems. Priority should next be given to reaching early progress towards limitations and substantial reductions of the strategic nuclear arsenals of the two super-Powers. We call for further intensification of efforts aimed at reaching agreements which are fair  balanced and effectively verifiable.Urgent progress must also be made in other fields of arms control and disarmament. À global ban on chemical weapons should enhance international security and lead to the removal from countries' arsenals of a particularly horrifying and inhuman instrument of war. We cannot forget that it is conventional weapons that have caused millions of deaths around the world since 1945 and continue to do so. The Twelve want to use this opportunity to underline the importance of the process started in Stockholm towards building greater military confidence in Europe  the first result of which constitutes a success recognized by all. We hope to see further progress in this field at the CSCE follow-up meeting in Vienna. The Twelve underline their strong interest in the discussions in this connection on further steps to promote the establishment in Europe of a secure and stable balance of conventional forces at a lower level and an increase in military transparency. We also strongly support efforts within the United Nations to tackle the problem of conventional disarmament. In this field  as in many others  the third special session on disarmament presents an opportunity to make a further contribution to progress in the arms-control and disarmament process  including effective steps towards the establishment of the necessary transparency of military budgets according to objective standards.One area that carries deep scars of regional tension and armed conflict is the Middle East. The conflict between Iraq and Iran has now lasted for seven terrible years and continues to cause widespread death  destruction and suffering. This conflict represents an increasingly serious threat to security and to freedom of navigation in the Gulf. As expressed in their declaration of 3 September this year  the Twelve are seriously concerned by the continuation of the Iraq-Iran conflict and the resulting increase in tension in the Gulf. The Twelve whole-heartedly support Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and call for its early implementation in full. Noting the positions of the two parties as expressed to date  we call urgently for speedy implementation of the resolution and the immediate observance of a cease-fire on land  on the sea and in the air.We fully support the Secretary-General in his efforts to achieve this end and appeal to both Iraq and Iran to co-operate fully with him. We reiterate our firm support for the fundamental principle of freedom of navigation  which is of the utmost importance to the whole international community. The Arab-Israeli conflict remains an issue of concern to us all. It lies at the heart of continuing tension in the Near East  and further efforts are urgently needed to achieve progress towards a just  global and lasting settlement of this conflict. The Twelve's views on the key elements which must make up a solution to this conflict are well known. In accordance with the Venice Declaration and other declarations  two principles are fundamental: the right of all States in the area  including Israel  to exist within secure frontiers·  and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  with all that this implies. We call upon the parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict to open the doors to peace by recognizing each other's rights. Against the background of their long-standing contacts with the region  the Twelve are following closely current diplomatic efforts to revitalize the peace process. In our declarations of 23 February and 13 July this year  we have stated that we are in favour of an international conference  held under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of interested parties as well as any other party able to make a direct and positive contribution to the restoration and maintenance of peace and to the region's economic and social development. Such a conference provides a suitable framework for the necessary negotiations between the parties directly concerned and seems to us at present to be the only formula to allow the peace process to move forward. We are in close contact with all the parties concerned and we shall do all in our power to encourage them to bring their positions sufficiently close together to allow such an international conference to be held - and to achieve worthwhile results.The Twelve are increasingly concerned about the situation of human rights in the occupied territories. We renew our call on Israel to fulfil its obligations a; the occupying Power  pending its withdrawal  to lift restrictions on political and economic activities and  as we have reiterated recently in our declaration of 14 September/ to put an end to the illegal policy of settlements. In order to help improve the living conditions of the Palestinians in the occupied territories  the Community and its member States will continue to provide economic assistance directly to the Palestinians/ assistance designed to allow the territories to enjoy the fruits of normal economic development. This assistance is in no sense an alternative to a lasting political settlement - but we hope nevertheless that it may help in a small way to bring such a settlement nearer.As to the tragic fate of Lebanon we remain firmly committed to Lebanon's sovereignty  unity  independence and territorial integrity. We welcome the vital work being done by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and call on all involved to support the UNIFIL force and allow it to carry out its mandate fully and in the best possible security conditions.Turning now to the question of Cyprus/ a member of the European family I cannot disregard the fact that the situation remains unchanged. The tragic division of the island continues. The Twelve attach great importance to a just and viable solution of this problem. To that effect  we reaffirm our strong backing for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. We stand fully by our previous statements and reject any action which purports to establish an independent State within Cyprus. We also express our support to the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices and ask those concerned to co-operate with him in the search for a solution to this problem of international concern and to refrain from words or actions that might adversely affect the prospects of a solution by peaceful means.Turning to South Africa  we face a situation which none of us can view with equanimity. The Twelve have always made clear their unequivocal condemnation of apartheid  an immoral and unacceptable system which breeds hatred and violence. We remain convinced that what is needed in South Africa is a genuine national dialogue. Only broad-based negotiations  involving the genuine representatives c the various components of the South African population  can bring about a lasting settlement. The aim of the negotiations should be the emergence of a free  democratic  non-racial and United South Africa which takes into account the diversity of its society. The longer the Government delays  the more difficult this exercise will become. The longer the Government relies on repression as it£ main response to demands for change  the stronger will become the position of the in the majority who argue that only force can end apartheid. An increasing majority of South Africans will conclude that there is no way in which apartheid can reform itself through the parody of democracy practised in their country.On the face of it  the outcome of the white elections in May was a victory for those in the minority community opposed to fundamental change. But in reality it was a defeat for everybody. The white minority community voted for the continued exclusion of the majority of the South Africans from having any say. For the tin being  the South African Government may be able to suppress opposition by force. But it cannot stop the clock of history. Apartheid is doomed the sooner the Government in South Africa comes to terms with that fact  the better. President Botha has the necessary majority in Parliament to abolish apartheid  and start paving the way for peaceful development in South Africa.The meeting in Dakar earlier this summer between a courageous group of individual South Africans and leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) leaders illustrated the fact that common ground can still be found between the two communities.We have frequently made clear the sort of steps which we believe the South African Government should take in order to allow a process of peaceful change to begin. We do not believe that a dialogue can take place while leaders of the majority are imprisoned or in exile  their political organizations are proscribed  and the state of emergency continues. Yet Nelson Mandela  probably the most respected political leader in South Africa  has now been in prison for more than 25 years.At the same time  we shall continue to provide assistance to the victims of apartheid  inside South Africa as well as in the neighbouring States. The latter continue to suffer from South Africa's destabilization and armed incursions. We shall continue to monitor every aspect of the effects of apartheid  including human-rights violations and other abuses committed under cover of the state of emergency. The Twelve will continue to use pressure to bring about peaceful change  In the absence of significant progress in the abolition of apartheid  the attitude of the Twelve to South Africa remains under constant review.We call once again cm South Africa to allow Namibia to become independent without delay on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). There is no justification for any other conduct.The Twelve are concerned by the continued of the conflict between Chad and Libya. They believe that Chad has the right to decide its own destiny free from interference from neighbouring countries. They note that there is a territorial dispute between the two countries. Conscious of the dangers inherent in the Present situation  they hope that this dispute can be resolved peacefully  in accordance with international law and as rapidly as possible. They therefore wish to see either a direct agreement between the two parties or recourse to a process of international arbitration. The ad hoc committee created by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in order to deal with the dispute and the International Court of Justice seem the most appropriate bodies. In Western Sahara  we appeal to the parties to respond positively to the Secretary-General's efforts to find a peaceful solution.We note with concern the continued tension in the Horn of Africa and look forward to peaceful negotiated settlements among the countries concerned. We urge them also to take further steps to achieve the peaceful settlement of internal conflicts and to ensure respect for human rights in their countries. We are seriously concerned at the likely extent of food shortages  especially in Ethiopia. We attach particular importance to appropriate policies to help prevent further famine and to promote food security. We recognize the immediate need for humanitarian relief in the region  and are playing our part.As to the division of the Korean peninsula and the continuing tension there  we see a resumption of the suspended direct dialogue between North and South as t e only way to reach a solution by peaceful means. It is our hope that  on the basis of the principle of universality  the people of Korea may soon gain full membership of this Organization. We have been encouraged by the progress made towards democratic reforms in the Republic of Korea. We extend our best wishes for the success of the forthcoming Olympic games.The continued Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea  in violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations and international law  remains an issue of the greatest concern to the international community. Kampuchea must be free both of foreign troops and of any prospect of a return to the appalling activities of the Khmer Rouge. The Twelve call upon the new leadership in Hanoi o end the Vietnamese military intervention in Kampuchea in order to contribute to a rapid peaceful solution placing the fate of the hard-tried Kampuchean people in its own hands. To that end  we support a settlement of this tragic conflict in accordance with repeated United Nations resolutions  while expressing our firm support for the constructive efforts made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations.We have seen this year In Sri Lanka encouraging proof that  where opportunities are grasped with courage and determination  conflict can be resolved. The Twelve warmly welcomed the agreement signed on 29 July between Sri Lanka and India for a peaceful solution to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka  a solution which we have long advocated. But such agreements can work only with the good will of all concerned; we urge them to continue to comply with the provisions of the agreement.The Twelve reaffirm the particular Importance they attach to the strengthening and development of relations with Latin America  foe historical  political  economic and cultural reasons. Recent developments in Central America give cause for optimism. We warmly welcome the agreement signed at the Central American summit at Guatemala City on 7 August and supported by the Contadora Group and its Support Group. That agreement offers a historic opportunity to end armed conflict and bring peace and genuine democracy to the region. We have always believed that any lasting solution to Central America's problems had to emerge from within the region itself  and we urge the five countries  as well as all countries with links and Interest In the region  to co-operate constructively in implementing the Guatemala agreement within the time-frame prescribed. The Twelve remain committed to helping them  both by intensifying our political dialogue with the region  which is due to be carried forward by ministers at a meeting in the Federal Republic of Germany early next year  and by using our economic assistance to encourage and strengthen regional co-operation and Integration. I should like now to turn to a problem from which none of us can be confident of remaining free: international terrorism. This is a scourge that can threaten any of our citizens at any time. The strength of the Twelve's commitment to combating terrorism whenever and wherever it appears is well known. We believe that effective international co-operation is indispensable in responding to the terrorist threat. In that connection  maintaining the consensus in this Assembly represented by resolution 40/61 is in the interest of all. All involved must be made to realize that acts of terrorism can only damage the causes they purport to help. For our part  the Twelve have left third countries in no doubt about our collective determination to take action in this field. No country which lends support to terrorism can expect to enjoy normal relations with the Twelve. When we have clear indications of government support for terrorism we shall not hesitate to act. We are working hard in partnership with other like-minded countries to ensure that the perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice. We think that any Government supporting them should be strongly condemned by the international community.In their approach to the rest of the world  the Twelve continue to attach the utmost importance to respect for human rights. For us  human rights are not a minor byway of international relations) they are of central importance in our dealings with all countries. The concept of human rights is not a convenient catchword to be used in attacking those with whom we disagree. It involves the acceptance of a set of fundamental standards of civilized behaviour by which и should all be ready to be judged. Over the years  the United Nations has plaid a key role in establishing such internationally accepted standards in this vitally important area. We naturally expect all Members of the United Nations to live up to those standards. We welcome any efforts designed to strengthen existing mechanisms established to ensure that nations' words are matched by deeds. We feel free - indeed obliged - to raise these issues with others when human rights are ignored or abused. The entering into force in June this year of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was an important step in the tight direction.We feel obliged to alleviate the plight of those who suffer from abuse of human tights  not least those who have been forced to leave their country. We think efforts should be made  on the basis of the concept of international solidarity  to improve the protection of the world's refugees. The Twelve reaffirm the role of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as the International focal point for the promotion of durable solutions for refugees in all parts of the world  such as voluntary repatriation  regional integration or resettlement in third countries.The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  held at Vienna in June this year  was of primary importance to the Twelve. The European Community and its member States participated actively in it.The present overall economic situation is characterized by moderate growth  accelerated and profound changes in the world economy  shifting policy concerns and the persisting difficulties of many developing countries- Among the serious problems facing the world economy are the severe debt problem of many developing countries  continuing protectionist pressures and major changes in the relative weight of the commodities sector. Looming behind these problems is the deteriorating state in some areas of the global natural-resource base upon which economic development depends considerably. However  there is sometimes a tendency to focus on uncertainties and overlook positive developments  and despite the present uncertainties there is cause for some optimism. Efforts are under way to foster vigorous national economies and a more stable and growth-oriented world economy. Most countries ate endeavouring to combine effectively macro-economic and structural policies  to extend the role of the market and to develop their human potential.Equally important is the recognition of the joint responsibility for the functioning of the world economy  with each country contributing to the fostering of an expanding world economy in accordance with its ability. Most recently  this was demonstrated through the adoption by consensus of the Final Act of the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).It is indeed a major achievement that all 140 countries participating in the Conference agreed on a common assessment of the relevant economic trends and of their policy implications  as well as on policy approaches and measures to deal with debt problems and resources for development  commodities  international trade and the problems of the least developed countries.In the true spirit of interdependence and partnership  all countries recognized their responsibility  collectively and individually  to contribute according to their capacities and weight in the world economy to attainment of the common objective of revitalizing development  growth and international trade.Hopefully  the constructive and co-operative approach taken at the Conference will constitute not only a new beginning for UNCTAD Itself but also a milestone in international co-operation. The European Community and its member States worked actively towards this result. We fully support the Final Act of UNCTAD VII and will contribute constructively to the"" fulfilment of these undertakings in all the relevant international forums. We expect all other countries  developed and developing alike  to do the same  and look forward to a continued co-operative effort. The financing of the development efforts of the developing countries requires enhanced mobilization of domestic economic and human resources as well as increased external financial flows.Official development assistance will continue to play a decisive role for a large number of developing countries  particularly on highly concessional terms for the poorer and least developed countries. The European Community and its member States are already large donors. We realize that further efforts are needed to increase the effectiveness of aid and to achieve as quickly as possible the official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as adopted under the International Development Strategy and the official development assistance target of 1.5 per cent of gross national product for the least developed countries as adopted in the Substantial New Programme of Action.The multilateral institutions should be enabled to play a greater part in promoting more satisfactory growth  effective adjustment and mobilization of resources by providing concessional and non-concessional finance and by catalysing additional private capital flows.Accordingly  we support a capital increase for the World Bank. We favour an early agreement on a substantial increase. We also welcome the proposal of the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a significant increase in the resources of the IMF's Structural Adjustment Facility and are ready to work actively towards reaching a conclusion of discussions thereon this year.Handling the problems of debt facing many developing countries is one of themost important tasks confronting the international community. There has been an evolving response by the international community to the debt problems. There is recognition of the need for enhanced co-operative action on a case-by-case basis by the parties involved and further progress was achieved at UNCTAD VII. In this respect  resolution 41/202  adopted last year  may also be recalled as a positive step. We are convinced that the agreement at UNCTAD VII constitutes an important contribution to discussions of the debt-servicing problem  which will continue in the coming months in the relevant international forums.The debt-service burden of the poorest countries  primarily in sub-Saharan Africa  is particularly constraining. We fully accept measures adapted to the needs of these countries  which are undertaking adjustment efforts. Intensified deliberations in the Paris Club have already resulted in larger repayment and grace periods with respect to rescheduled official credit for certain countries in support of their far-reaching economic reforms  proposals for lower interest rates have been put forward.Turning to the field of international trade  the European Community worked hard for the launching of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations  and we intend to work vigorously towards its successful and balanced conclusion within the agreed time-frame.In recognition of the importance of trade in tropical products to a large number of developing countries  we are preparing a proposal to be presented at an early stage of the negotiations in the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).The Community remains firmly committed to the objectives and undertakings of the Punta del Este Declaration. As the developing countries progressively develop and improve their trade situation they should participate more fully in the framework of rights and obligations under the General Agreement  thereby allowing positive measures to be taken to meet the needs of the least developed countries.Liberalization and expansion of trade are in the interest of all countries and require concerted efforts. We take the agreement at UNCTAD VII as clear evidence that all Uruguay round participants are ready to shoulder their responsibilities. All parties concerned must undertake to adhere to the principles of multilateralism.Agriculture remains a major political issue and this field has witnessed major progress in recent months.Given the scope of the problems - for which all countries bear some responsibility - and their urgency  the Ministers of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development agreed in May this year on the principles for a concerted reform of the agricultural policies of their countries  to be implemented in a balanced manner. Reforms of agricultural policies in industrialized countries on the basis of these principles will also be of benefit to developing countries. The European Community reaffirms its commitment to this important agreement and stresses the decisive importance of the Uruguay round in this context.The agreement reached at UNCTAD VII on international co-operation between producers and consumers in the field of commodities drew on past experience  on a recognition of the complex circumstances affecting individual commodities  and thereby laid down the basis for working in the future towards constructive results in this field.A similarly realistic approach should be taken with regard to the Common Fund  which might now enter into force after the recent signing by several countries.The need for intensified international co-operation was also highlighted in the recent report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. The report gives us a timely reminder of the fragile ecological balance on which economic development is based. The World Commission has presented a strategy for sustainable development  which includes valuable guidelines to be used by the international community. The Environmental perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond also constitutes a basis for further discussions.The debate on the report of the Group of 18 High-Level Intergovernmental Experts and the adoption by consensus of resolution 41/213 clearly shows the determination of all Member States to reform and improve the Organization. The Twelve hope that the work prepared by the Committee for Programme and Co-ordination (CPC) will be successfully concluded during this session. The Secretary-General has demonstrated his determination to follow up seriously the reform process  and I can assure him of the full support of the Twelve in these efforts.It now remains for the Special Commission undertaking the in-depth study of the United Nations intergovernmental structure and functions in the economic and social fields to show the same kind of determination. The Twelve will continue to work actively for a positive outcome. It must be in the interest of all Member States to ensure that the intergovernmental machinery functions as effectively as possible  in accordance with the Charter. Furthermore  we strongly believe that  together with progress in other parts of the reform process  progress in this respect will contribute significantly to restoring confidence in the ability of the United Nations to deal effectively with issues entrusted to it.Reform is necessary to restore confidence in the merits of the Organization  but no reform can be completed if the Organization is deprived of the means to fulfil its mission. The Twelve emphasize again the need for all Member States to comply fully with their statutory financial obligations. There have been sufficient examples in the history of the United Nations to prove the value of multilateralism. The Twelve share the view expressed by the Secretary-General in his annual report that a pragmatic approach to the problems of an interdependent world provides a promising basis for broadened multilateral co-operation and for increased effectiveness of the United Nations. The Twelve firmly support a strong and effective United Nations  and trust that this objective is shared by all Member States. However  if we are to reach our common goal deeds must follow words.The forty-second session of the General Assembly started its work last week. The coming months will be characterized by a multitude of meetings in many committees. Let me finish by quoting Piet Hein  a Danish philosopher  who gives the following advice on the arithmetic of co-operation;""When you're adding up committees There's a useful rule of thumb: Talents make a difference. But follies make a sum"". Let us all add up our talents in order to settle our differences. The net result should be a better world."
"42",1996,"DOM",42,1987,"﻿It is a great honour for me to participate in the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly.First  Sir  I wish  on behalf of the Government and people of the Dominican Republic and on my own behalf  to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. That decision was made on the basis of your well-known personal and professional skills and experience in international affairs. These qualities will undoubtedly enable you to make a significant contribution to the success of our meetings.I take this opportunity to extend a cordial greeting to your predecessor  Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh  and thank him for the competent and authoritative way in which he carried out the duties of President at the last session.On behalf of the Dominican Government  I also have pleasure in extending warm greetings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and assuring him of our appreciation and gratitude for his praiseworthy and valiant efforts in pursuing the purposes of our Organization.The maintenance of peace and respect for the principle of non-intervention are unalterable elements of the foreign policy of my country  as set forth in our fundamental law and supported by our practice in international relations.Negotiation and dialogue are for my country the ideal instruments for the achievement and maintenance of peace  both nationally and internationally. Without peace there can be no economic progress or social development.Peace is not merely the absence of war or peace imposed by a superior force. Peace imposed by fear  conditional upon a balance of destructive power  is despicable and transitory. The fear of a nuclear cloud enveloping out planet prevents the full development of the human intelligence that would make possible the creation of conditions in which mankind could enjoy the material and spiritual benefits of this world. For this reason the Dominican Republic welcomes with hope the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union that will make it possible to establish conditions for the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles. We join the other speakers who have already applauded this step in the Assembly.One basis for peace is humane treatment of and solidarity with immigrants  be they undocumented aliens  political refugees or fugitives from war zones. That is why the Dominican Republic is taking the opportunity offered by this Assembly to consider one of the most harmful practices in this respect discrimination with regard to the mobility of factors of production. It is a little-known fact  but a fact none the less  that most of the countries represented here practise some kind of discrimination in their immigration policies.Emigration from our countries is a consequence of the worst economic crisis that virtually the whole of America has suffered since the 1930s. Despair and hunger force many people to leave their countries  homes  families and friends in search of something better. Is it just and charitable to treat our brothers who set out on that painful Odyssey so harshly and contemptuously? To do so is to undermine the foundations upon which the longed-for peace must be based.The Dominican Republic is convinced that the basis of a fruitful peace is  among other things  the gradual elimination of the protectionist barriers that prevent the free flow of international trade. Those barriers favour certain monopolistic interests  both political and economic·  they increase unemployment and inflation in the countries that take shelter behind this policy.Protectionism  whether by raising tariff barriers or by imposing quotas  is a two-edged sword that harms producers and consumers equally  to the benefit of a minority. It is extremely difficult  not to say impossible  to quantify the effects of increased protectionism upon our economies. The predictable result  however  is that the path of protectionism leads to the world-wide contraction of international trade.Protectionism may benefit some  but only in the short term for in the end it harms everyone  including the protectionists themselves. Free  vigorous world trade  unhampered by quotas  is indispensable to the well-being of the world economy. Every protectionist measure removes us further from that objective. We must  therefore  all move together towards a process of liberalization of world trade·  but for that purpose  it is necessary that more countries accede to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Our position on the problem of foreign debt is well-defined. Our country is not in a position to honour the debt-servicing scheduled  particularly considering the precarious levels of our foreign exchange resources. What is needed  therefore  is a programme that will reconcile what the country should pay and what it can pay  always bearing in mind that economic growth and the subsistence of our: people must not be sacrificed. With regard to our debt to commercial banks  we press for the concession of longer grace and repayment periods by the World Bank and the substantial reduction of the interest rates on that debt. As regards our bilateral debt  we firmly believe that for the achievement of bilateral negotiations it is not necessary for us to reach a prior agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMP)   In this regard we have publicly stated our intention to restructure our commitments with the Paris Club whether or not there exists a financing programme with the Fund. We share the view that the countries members of the Paris Club should urgently revise their restructuring policies in order to permit multilateral agreements with debtor countries.On the multilateral debt  our country considers it absolutely necessary  precisely at this time of financial crisis  for international development banks and multilateral agencies to maintain a net positive flow of resources to our countries. Otherwise debt servicing to these institutions will become virtually impossible. What is required is the greatest possible flexibility on the part of International bodies as regards the repayment of the loans  their methods of procedure  credit policies and a greater supply of concessional resources.Concerning South-South debt  my country hopes that the financial relations of payment and repayment of external debt with developing countries may be framed in terms of new patterns of compensation  bearing in mind the relative levels of development and the availability of reserves in each of our countries.We must all make a determined effort to eradicate the inequalities brought about by social maladjustment which provoke international social agitators  who take a heroic stance in their actions but are no more than criminals.On terrorism my country believes that at this forty-second session the General Assembly should unanimously adopt a resolution appealing to all Governments to set in motion the provisions of General Assembly resolution 40/61 of 1985. Any other course would be a waste of time. We cannot establish distinctions between social agitation and the legitimate struggle of oppressed peoples. Another threat to peace is the growing traffic in drugs  a far worse evil than nuclear clouds. We must therefore launch a publicity campaign under the auspices of this world Organization to ensure that  utilizing the most modern and sophisticated means of mass communication  we can inform mankind about the dangers represented by the consumption of and traffic in drugs. As repression has so far proved ineffectual  it would be better to work for a drop in consumption  which would hurt the drug traffic.My country wishes to emphasize the grave danger to mankind of the spread of AIDS (acquired immune-deficiency syndrome) with its serious consequences. As was recently pointed out by the Holy Father Pope John Paul II  this is a ""grave crisis"". It has been shown that this illness is not only spreading throughout economically and culturally disadvantaged areas but is also increasing in civilized regions  where its advance has taken on alarming proportions.My delegation proposes that the United Nations should foster research to find a remedy for this illness} that fellowships be created to help laboratories look into the origin and cause of the disease; and that a data bank be established for the exchange of information about it. This is a matter that is as important as  if not more important than  the other threats mentioned previously  such as nuclear weapons  external debt  protectionism  discrimination against immigrants and the drug traffic.My delegation also believes that great importance attaches to the problem of the elderly. Many years have elapsed since the General Assembly at its thirty-seventh session adopted its resolution 40/30 endorsing the International Plan of Action on Aging. In view of the enormous magnitude and growing complexity of the question of aging  the Government of the Dominican Republic considers that the time has come for the United Nations to adopt a declaration on the rights of the aged and that the Governments of all countries  developed and developing  should lend their sponsorship to this matter so that this sector of the population  to which we shall all ultimately belong  may occupy its rightful place in the community and in society in general.In our judgement it would also be beneficial to convene in 1992  the tenth anniversary of the Vienna Conference  a second world assembly on aging at which we would use the same Kind of complementary measures employed so successfully at the International Conference on Population held in Mexico City in 1984 and at the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women held in Nairobi in 1985. With respect to the measures adopted by the Dominican Government to avert the economic crisis  I must say that these have been very appropriate.In the fiscal area  the aim we have set for ourselves is that of significantly reducing our fiscal deficit until we make it less than 1 per cent of our gross domestic product. Bearing in mind that during the past year this deficit was in the order of 5 per cent of the gross national product  such a reduction of our deficit would imply a drastic reduction in the inefficiency of our economic system. To bring about this significant reduction in the deficit  we are applying important administrative and structural reforms in our economic policy.Before reducing its expenses  the Dominican Government is introducing the reform of a fiscal system  designed to simplify our tax structure  to increase its elasticity and to rationalize our tariff system. What has been achieved so far this year indicates that the savings for the central Government were five times greater than for the same period last year. This has helped to bring about the duplication of capital expenditure and the reduction of deficits as programmed. The structural reforms include privatisation of State sugar-cane lands by sale to the private sector so that the lands may be used for the development of agricultural and tourist projects.Another structural reform is integration of the production and sale of electric power into the private sector. In the Dominican Republic  this public service has so far been supplied by a State monopoly in a very inefficient manner.There would be little use in my country's applying an economic policy directed outside  increasing national savings and reorienting the role of Government with regard to the economy if there were not a supportive policy on the part of the industrialized countries with whom we conduct trade. From these industrial nations we require a renovation of the process of liberalization of international trade. We would request them to reduce their subsidies to exports since these are prejudicial to our people. The first world must avoid restrictions on its imports so that the exports of the third world will not suffer.Some industrialized countries should promote a reduction in their real interest rates even if to do this they have to reduce their excessive budget deficits. Moreover  the International Bank could contribute by reducing the margins charged for its loans  especially for those countries that are going through an adjustment process. We could create amongst all of us defensive techniques that would enable us to face future increases in interest rates — for example through the use of compensatory financing facilities by the International Monetary Fund (IHF)   There is little sense in our having net flows towards the IMF or the World Bank when we could be obtaining from them greater resources than those which we are paying  and precisely when we most need such flows.The industrialized countries could contribute new funds to the international organizations so that these  in turn  could be channelled to our countries. Latin America will need some $20 billion annually in coming years. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development - the World Bank - and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) are being called upon to do their share  especially in the short term. These institutions are capable of expanding their co-financing operations and partial guarantees of private loans.The first objective of ray Government's global economic policy is to establish self-sustaining economic growth so as to continue expanding employment and per capita income for the population. In view of the growing external indebtedness  my authorities are responding and mobilizing as many material and human resources as possible for the promotion of economic growth and achieving a rate of real growth of approximately 11 per cent per annum during a large part of this year.My Government's second objective is to face responsibly the problems of external debt. In so far as we are complying with the deadline agreed to we are requiring out creditors to accept that these be paid in the roost feasible manner and without extraordinary sacrifices by the people.Along with those objectives we are working to distribute income more equitably  but not simply by taking away from some to give to others rather  by educating all to produce and create wealth. We recognize that the solution to our poverty is not to divide our wealth amongst more people but to increase that wealth so that it can be better distributed among all. Economic growth is the best means we have to do so  and in that way respond to the essential needs of our population.To attain those objectives we are orienting our external economic policy  promoting exports  foreign investment and tourism  and requiring more efficient import substitution. To expand our external trade we are seeking a competitive and realistic exchange rate  and trying to avoid protectionist excesses to which we are so inclined.With regard to the balance-of-payments problems  we are trying to remove the temptation to increase State intervention. Experience has taught us that the final result of such interventions tends to be a wasting of resources and a private sector which is more independent of the Government. In addition  we cannot demand that others be less protectionist if we are not prepared to move towards increasingly free world trade.We are seeking to stimulate the repatriation of the flight of capital and provide a more secure profitability. We hope truly to reward persons who save so that they can effectively contribute their savings to national endeavours. We are encouraging savings and discouraging consumption  paying attractive interest to those who save and eliminating the subsidies that still exist in our banking system.Further  we are stimulating the entry of foreign capital  especially if it does not imply debts. Accordingly  within a few weeks the Dominican authorities will begin to permit the conversion of a considerable part of our external debt into investments. This conversion will significantly reduce our debt and its servicing; it will contribute positively to our economic growth and generate more employment and income for our population. The Dominican Republic has applied for admission into the Lome Group. Why Lomé? Because we have a reality before us: the need to rely on the support and solidarity of those industrialized nations which are members of the European Economic Community. The States members of that Community in the Lome framework are encouraging autonomous and sustained development of the countries of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific; they accord more favourable treatment than the most-favoured-nation treatment and the Generalized System of Preferences; and they implement technical and financial assistance for development in the form of subsidies and special hard and soft loans among other things.The Dominican Republic is seriously concerned at the situation prevailing in various parts of the world where existing tensions and conflicts are endangering peace and stability. Our country reaffirms the need to foster national reconciliation in countries with divided communities. Similarly  we urge respect for the right of peoples to self-determination and for the principle that no State has the right to intervene by force of arms or in any other manner in the internal affairs of another State.On the other hand  we are concerned at the indifference of some States with regard to the implementation of resolutions adopted by overwhelming majorities in the General Assembly with a view to solving extremely important questions for world security. This apathy calls into question the viability of the United Nations as an organization and thwarts its commitment to maintain international peace and security; moreover  it undermines internationalism and threatens the solvency of the United Nations.It is necessary to strengthen the mandate of the United Nations and  at the same time  avoid any initiative that may weaken its capacity for action and its role as the universal instrument of peace. This Assembly has before it once again the same crises and conflicts about which it has debated for several sessions. This reflects the repetitive character of the Assembly's debates and the scanty progress achieved in eliminating tensions and problems affecting the international community. The perpetuation of many conflicts is due essentially to non-observance of the principles set forth in the Charter  lack of respect for the standards of conduct enshrined in international morality and law# and the absence of a determination by the parties concerned to find just and equitable solutions to the problems.My Government reiterates the need for the immediate and complete withdrawal of foreign troops now in Afghanistan and urges all States to respect that country's territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty. I express the firm hope that negotiations during the next round of talks will bring about a satisfactory resolution to end this long conflict# thus providing the Afghan people with an opportunity freely to exercise its right to self-determination in a genuine way - because that invasion of Afghanistan is a potential threat to peace. We applaud the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General and once again express support for United Nations resolutions urging a peaceful solution.There are today countries facing serious crises owing to external causes and pressures# such as Kampuchea and Chad. We support# to the extent of our possibilities# every effort being made to establish freedom and democracy in those regions.The Dominican Republic has maintained a traditional position of support for Argentina's legitimate claims over the Malvinas Islands; consistent with that traditional position we urge Argentina and the United Kingdom to make every effort to initiate the kind of talks called for in General Assembly resolution 40/21. Peace on the Korean peninsula is a matter of the greatest interest to the international community. However  the objective of unification of the communities of South and North Korea must not be brought about by force but by peaceful means  through dialogue and negotiation between the two parties  which should be resumed without pre-conditions or extraneous requirements.My delegation considers that a concrete way to resume the dialogue would be through conversations between the Foreign Ministers of the two Koreas in conformity with the initiative formulated a few months ago by the Republic of South Korea.May I now refer to Haiti  the nation with which we share our Island of Hispaniola  a country with which we are United by so many links that it would take a long time to enumerate them. The Haitian people and Government face an enormous task in achieving the aims they have set for themselves: freedom  democracy  work for all  and the creation of conditions that enable that people to enjoy its inalienable right to education and health. Only through exercise of their human rights will the inhabitants of Haiti be able to enjoy the fruits of this world  which its Creator has put here for us all. In this respect  the Haitian people needs the help of all of us  which does not imply foreign interference in its affairs. We support the statement made here along those lines by President Namphy·The Dominican Republic  for its part  is increasing its bilateral contacts with that sister republic to create a modern system between the two countries involving free bilateral trade; the mutual combating of deforestation; and the exchange of journalists  teachers and students so that we may each learn about the realities  needs and pains of the other and so that  for a given length of time; professionals from one country may practise In the other without discrimination. The Dominican Republic supports the efforts being exerted to bring an end to the fratricidal conflict in Central America. With hope we join in the agreement for peace recently signed by five Central American Presidents in Guatemala. That agreement should be encouraged in so far as it constitutes the basis upon which a commitment may be forged to establish democracy  ideological pluralism  freedom and respect in that long-suffering region of our hemisphere. We therefore unreservedly support the appeal made here recently by the President of Costa Rica  Mr. Oscar Arias Sanchez  for concord to prevail in Central America.The Dominican Republic supports all efforts to bring an end to the long war between Iraq and Iran. In the light of the latest developments in the Persian Gulf  there arises an ominous question as to the world's future: are we moving towards world conflict and reaching the point of no return? We hope that the desire for peace that has been shown by the Great Powers may prevail in those two nations and in their religious feelings.A constant feature of my country's foreign policy is our deep concern about the Middle East. Ours is a nation of immigrants  and our population includes people of both Arabic and Jewish origin  all of whom are contributing  in an extraordinary fashion  to the development of our country  in a true model of human coexistence. Why should that not be the case in the countries from which those Jewish and Arabic immigrants have come?My country feels that the only way to achieve peace in the Middle East is through dialogue between the parties to the conflict based on the provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The Dominican Republic maintains its position of unwavering friendship towards the peoples of that region. We do not believe that friendship with one of the countries of the region should result in discrimination against others. Such friendship should not be criticized; no country should be criticized for being on friendly terms with either of the parties to the conflict  as sometimes happens when a country helps one of them.In conclusion  I have not dealt with all of the important items on our agenda. I come from a small country  but one that has the good fortune to have a great President  Mr. Joaquin Balaguer  whose modern conception of history enables him to be an insightful observer of the world scene. Thus we feel solidarity with all the peoples represented here who bear the burden of many problems like ours. For that reason  my country will be represented wherever there are appeals for solidarity  respect  and efforts for peace. We wish to live in a world in which nations large and small may have equal opportunities for the benefit of their citizens  and the right to enjoy the resources we should all enjoy without discrimination.Our country has demonstrated that we have a stable democracy. In my country there are no political prisoners and no discrimination of any kind  religious or cultural. For this reason  our arms are open to all. Because of our history and our language  we are a country of the Caribbean and also a country of Latin America. That is why we wish to serve as a bridge between the two Americas so that peace may prevail in our continent."
"43",2043,"DZA",42,1987,"﻿The Algerian delegation warmly congratulates you. Sir  on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your long experience in international affairs and especially your awareness of problems closely linked to United Nations activities justify the honour the Assembly has done you in giving you this onerous task. We are convinced that you will do your work to the great benefit of the Assembly. In electing you  Sir  our Assembly also wished to honour your country for its role in working significantly for a future in which dialogue and co-operation have a special place. My country is honoured to enjoy such dialogue and co-operation with your country. I assure you that you will always have the fullest support from me personally and from my country.Your position was previously held by Mr  Humayun Rasheed Choudhury. Showing his authority with regard to the matters before the Assembly and making himself available to all  he constantly demonstrated his inexhaustible personal resources  which he put at the service of the general interest. He was thus a credit to a brotherly country  Bangladesh  but even more of a credit to the whole international community. I hope that he will accept our expression of gratitude and my brotherly wishes for his future health and happiness.Our Organization has benefited greatly from being able to count on the unfailing devotion to duty of the Secretary-General  his absolute commitment and his tireless work in the efficient service of the shared interests of its Members. With his identification with the United Nations in the promotion of peace and development through dialogue  joint efforts and universal action  he embodies a conviction  which is infectious  that our Organization is irreplaceable  especially at times when attempts are made to question that.The agreement in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union on the withdrawal and destruction of short-range and medium-range missiles based in Europe is  though it has yet to be formally confirmed  certainly a long-awaited event. Coming after a period of dangerous tension in super-Power relations  it offers timely hope of a better future in international relations. It is naturally very important  since it will be the first genuine nuclear disarmament agreement yet reached. We therefore welcome it and applaud its achievement. However  if the agreement is to have a significant historic meaning  apart from its importance in providing a moment of détente in super-Power relations  which have been troubled  it should set a lead for bilateral and multilateral negotiations. It is essential from this point of view that those concerned resolutely pursue the negotiations on the gradual reduction of strategic weapons and the prevention of an arms race in space  and that agreements be drafted or finalized on the banning of nuclear tests and on the banning and destruction of chemical weapons.Close to Europe both in immutable geographical terms and in terms of a constantly changing history  Algeria cannot but be concerned when matters affecting Europe can affect Algeria's security  as is shown by the Maghreb's involvement in the two World Wars and the fact that it is within range of the missiles I have mentioned.Algeria's promotion of extended dialogue and in-depth co-operation with the countries involved in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe process should be understood in that light. Its action  taken with the other non-aligned Mediterranean countries  as was recently demonstrated at the meeting in Brioni  Yugoslavia  is aimed at accelerating the establishment of equal security for all in the Mediterranean. In this regard  measures concerning disarmament  the relaxation of tension and the promotion o£ greater security must be extended to the whole of the Mediterranean area  because the major nuclear Powers have a special responsibility in this regard since they maintain naval fleets and weapons  including nuclear weapons  in the region.That means that détente and understanding cannot be limited to any given region of the world  no matter how sensitive that region might be  because nuclear and conventional forces are concentrated there or because it might potentially be the scene of a major conflict. Since world peace is not divisible  nor can detente be  unless the errors of the past are to be repeated and people are to continue to be unable to lay sensible  lasting foundations for a better future for all.The dividends resulting from East-West dialogue must also play a part in lessening local tensions and defusing regional hotbeds of crisis. An improvement in super-Power relations and  beyond that  the improvement in relations between the two major military alliances does not mean that the legitimate security concerns of the non-aligned countries  especially Mediterranean non-aligned countries  can be ignored.Thus we return to the fundamental truth that the problems connected with world security are indivisible and therefore require a comprehensive  integrated approach. While the regional approach has its merits  it can validly use its specific resources in the promotion of world peace only in conditions of non-discrimination and respect for the equal right of all States to security. In the still troubled context of international relations  each of our countries must be able to contribute its brick to the edifice of peace. This is the expression of loyalty to the United Nations and faith in its ideals. It is also the essential measure of the contribution of each country to the advent of a new era in international relations - relations which we hope will bring peace  stability  security and progress for all. That brick in the edifice of peace Algeria gives to the Maghreb  in the unshakeable conviction that that grouping of countries has no other choice  no other future  than that in the unity which is its natural destiny. It is a sign of our times that peoples are committed  in addition to affirming and preserving their specific identity  to seeking and finding with their neighbours and immediate or traditional partners the common interests and shared aspirations that enable them  because their concerns are the same  to overcome mistrust and past misunderstandings and formulate together a unitary project that reflects the new requirements of development and the increased need for greater security.This is especially true with regard to the peoples of the Maghreb  the expression of whose genius and creativity in their daily life derives from a unique heritage of culture  religion and civilization. In order to preserve that heritage they have in the recent past  had to fight in solidarity and together make the greatest sacrifices. The great Arab Maghreb  supported by the strength that the past has given it and undaunted by present obstacles remains an aspiration for the future and is an objective to work for. My country  even before its independence  decided to commit its will  determination and means to the attainment of that objective  thus making it a strategic objective desired by the people and pursued by their leaders. It is a task which  to be worthy of the values it proclaims  cannot proceed in ignorance or with disregard of that which is essential to the authenticity and legitimacy of that unitary project: respect for the fullness of the rights of each people called upon to carry out the work. Together with the other Maghreb leaders# President Chadli Bendjedid took the initiative in moving to a new stage in the Maghreb unitary process directed towards economic integration and collective political efforts based on the Treaty of fraternity and harmony between Algeria  Tunisia and Mauritania.The purpose of that initiative was to expand the prospects for joint action by the countries of the Maghreb within the framework of that Treaty and to proceed progressively and methodically in such a way that each step would prepare the next and build on solid past achievements until the ultimate goal  unity  was achieved through the will and to the advantage of all.We do not underestimate either the arduous nature of the task  the scope of the problems yet to be solved or the obstacles to be overcome. Since the united Great Arab Maghreb is an inevitable reality of the future  it is necessary now to make the proper choices and ensure the determination and active participation of all. We have no doubt that in all decisive instances the proper choices will be made and the determination and participation of all will be there.Originally established by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  a peace plan that is now universally endorsed sets the framework  defines the conditions and identifies the means for achieving a negotiated peaceful  just and final solution of the conflict. The essential requirement is direct negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario front  the two parties to the conflict  on the conditions for a cease-fire and a referendum on self-determination. And  finally  the referendum can only be authentic if it is free from all administrative or military constraints. The United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) are today engaged in a joint good-offices process. Algeria welcomes the joint initiative of the current Chairman of the OAU and the Secretary-General in sending a technical mission to the Territory to determine the methods necessary to ensure the holding of a credible referendum organized and monitored by the OAU and the United Nations. We hope that this mission will be able to carry out its task validly  thereby enabling the current Chairman of the OAU and the Secretary-General to submit appropriate proposals for implementing the peace plan laid down in OAU resolution 104 and endorsed only last year by the General Assembly in its resolution 41/16.It goes without saying that if the conflict in Western Sahara is to be finally settled by means of a referendum  that referendum must meet the indispensable requirements of justice and regularity. The concept and the carrying out of the referendum must not  therefore  presuppose a result that would confirm and legitimise a fait accompli and thereby give the occupying force a military or administrative presence that could greatly influence the result of the referendum.The continuation and consolidation of the efforts of the United Nations and the OAU demonstrate that there is the good will to give assistance and take action to ensure the end of this fratricidal conflict. That is true  particularly  of the fraternal intervention of King Fahd Ibn Abdelaziz El Saoud  the sovereign of Saudi Arabia and the guardian of the Holy Places. This is a praiseworthy intervention that deserves our greatest appreciation.Algeria endeavours to add stones to the edifice of world peace wherever local tensions or regional crises call for its contribution or its efforts at the side of others. That is true of the Middle East crisis  the painful situation in fraternal Lebanon  the fratricidal conflict that is draining the finest human and material resources and potential of Iraq and Iran  and the situation in Chad  to which my county extends best wishes for national reconciliation and reconstruction in its entire territory.In the Middle East  the Palestinian people continue to be the victims of an intolerable situation. They have been unjustly robbed of their homeland and are forced to struggle for the full restoration of their national rights. Forty years of struggle bear witness to the impossibility of bringing peace back to the region if the right of the Palestinians to an independent State established on their historical territory  Palestine  is not realized. A solution to the Middle East conflict inevitably requires the restoration of the occupied Arab territories  including Al-Qods Al-Sharif. Lebanon's tragedy lies at the heart of our concerns. In its cruel ordeal  it can rest assured of our solidarity. Algeria is and will remain beside it in its efforts to mobilize its forces and bring together all its sons in restored national unity and understanding  and to affirm its authority and sovereignty over all its territory ravaged by Zionist occupation.The solution to the Middle East crisis must be comprehensive. It is unimaginable outside the framework of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations. Such a conference remains  in this respect  an irreplaceable requirement  since it alone can embrace all the dimensions and aspects of the crisis.We are among those who believe that the idea of such a conference  or even agreeing to hold it  is not an end in itself. The important thing is to identify what is to be involved. In that respect  there are four factors that must be taken fully into account if everyone's goal today is really to ensure a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East crisis. First  there is the nature o£ the conference. Its limits and its inability to provide the real solution expected of it would become immediately apparent if it were reduced to being an umbrella covering a series of bilateral negotiations - territorial or otherwise - and failed to address itself to the central parameters of the crisis  that is  the Palestinian question. To cover up the Palestinian question would be to forget that it is and will remain the original cause of the disputes in the Middle East and that if  as such  it is not solved there can be no real peace in the region.Secondly  there are the powers  the competence  of the conference. How could anyone venture to relieve the United Nations of its primary responsibilities in that respect  when we know the stake it has in the issue in view of its past role in the Palestinian tragedy? The United Nations continues to have complete and full responsibilities in this question  and they must be expressed within the international conference to be convened.Thirdly  there is the matter of participation in the conference. The Palestinian question is the central issue to be resolved  and that cannot be done if its authentic representatives are absent and their aspirations and wishes are excluded - for they are the only representatives who can validly formulate and defend those aspirations and wishes.Fourthly  there is the objective of the conference. How could that be anything but simple recognition of this natural right recognized by everyone; the right to self-determination  through the exercise of which the Palestinians would regain their homeland?The war between Iraq and Iran continues. Today it is spreading dangerously in the Gulf  putting at risk the security and stability of fraternal countries in the region. This war  which is now in its eighth year  has become one of the bloodiest and most devastating in modern times. It is being waged to the increasing detriment of the real interests of the peoples of Iran and Iraq. But an inevitably common destiny requires them to work harder to identify the ways and means of finally bringing a peaceful end to their conflict so that  together  they can resolutely devote their potential to all the areas of solidarity which today unite the third world  faced with so many challenges. The Secretary-General is working to bring the war to a halt. Algeria cannot but encourage and support him in the peace endeavours entrusted to him by the Security Council so that the Gulf can once again be a region of understanding and co-operation and peace and world security can be preserved.Algeria is an active partner in all the struggles being waged by Africa in a striking example of the mobilization of resources. In its efforts to attain full liberation and to foster its development  our continent is unfailingly and untiringly meeting its responsibilities. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) is playing a vital strategic role in this respect. It is up to the international community to meet its responsibilities towards a continent unfortunately characterized by  inter alia  persistent racial domination and an unparalleled state of underdevelopment. In southern Africa  one cannot but admire the determination of the people of South Africa in their struggle fully to regain their rights and to throw out apartheid  which is stepping up its repression even as it is increasingly being abandoned by the sources of support that once justified its existence and provided the resources it needed for survival. The struggle of the people of South Africa under the leadership of the African National Congress  (ANC) and the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) are exemplary in terms of their achievements and the scale of the sacrifices they have made and represent one of the key lessons of the late twentieth century  which will finally see the end of racial oppression. Today  at this late stage  when energetic measures under Chapter VII of the Charter have still not been taken  one wonders how such a crime against humanity  a crime condemned by history  could have been committed and allowed to continue without evoking the necessary determination to put an end to it. At the very least we are duty-bound to ensure that the peoples of South Africa  Namibia and the front-line States receive the decisive support called for in this final phase of their struggle.The border dispute between Chad and Libya has mobilized the resources of the OAU  which has demonstrated its capacity to provide the framework for the search for and attainment of a solution to the dispute. The committee of Heads of State set up by the OAU  which met recently in Lusaka  Zambia  has mapped out the appropriate path to be followed  which represents a significant and promising first step. Libya and Chad  whose proximity demands that they co-operate and reach an understanding  will  we trust find within themselves the sense of responsibility and courage necessary to ensure that what divides them today will tomorrow yield to mutual respect  understanding and progress for these two brother peoples.In Central America  real prospects of achieving a lasting peace and co-operation in the interests of all the peoples of the area have emerged  thanks to the peace plan agreed upon in Guatemala on 7 August and the dedication of President Arias of Costa Rica and the other Central American leaders. This supplements the tireless efforts of the Contadora and Lima Groups. It is to be hoped that this agreement will enjoy the sincere and unreserved support of all who are in a position to assist in the restoration of peace and harmony in the region.Algeria hails the political  economic and social achievements of Latin America and sincerely hopes they can be consolidated for the benefit of the peoples of Latin America so that their group of nations can reaffirm its place and confirm its role with respect to the defence of the essential cause of the Non-Aligned Movement and the developing world. In Harare  at the summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement  and in Brioni recently  at the ministerial conference of Mediterranean members of the movement  our countries made clear their views on the question of Cyprus. My country identifies with their stated position  endorses it and hopes it will provide the basis for a solution.The present system of contemporary international relations is a source of instability for all and an impediment for the developing countries. This fact prompted certain remarks made before the Group of 77  which I should like to share with the Assembly today:First  the developing world has lived up to its internal responsibilities with respect to development  but that has proved far from adequate.Secondly  the internal adjustments made by the developing world  at great political  economic and social cost  did not provide the expected result - far from it. At the very best  they had a negligible effect  as a result of the rigidity and inappropriateness of the external economic environment.Thirdly  these internal adjustments have shown the vital need for comprehensive structural adjustments  are necessary now  if on all sides there really exists the political will to receive the structural development crisis which the present system of international economic relations has created and serves to perpetuate.Fourthly  to talk about comprehensive structural adjustments inevitably implies the involvement of the United Nations  one of whose essential goals is to promote international co-operation for the well-being of all peoples.Hence  fifthly  the need for a reinvigorated North-South dialogue with precise objectives. The future of peace lies in disarmament and development  which are indissolubly linked and interdependent. Sixthly  and lastly  at a time when the North-South dialogue is dwindling  the United Nations has the duty to revitalize it  with our assistance and co-operation. The United Nations finds itself today at the crossroads. It must take up problems relating to the very survival of mankind at a time when the Organization sees its very existence threatened. On the one hand  we have a devastating nuclear arms race  which threatens the survival of life on our planet; on the other hand  we have a proportion of mankind whose precarious economic conditions have resulted in the tragic impossibility of assuring the basic means of survival. One is as morally unjustifiable as the other is in terms of common humanity. This dramatic situation was highlighted at a recent conference which pointed to ways for dealing with the disarmament-development equation.The pursuit and attainment of these objectives cannot be conceived without the United Nations  which must recover the vitality of its role and the full complement of its resources.There is no alternative to the preservation and strengthening of the role of the United Nations. If  in this respect  reforms are necessary to enhance its efficiency and if it can be shown that there is room for structural improvements  we all have the duty to encourage this and contribute to it. But as the international situation makes clear  one cannot dispense with this tool  the only one available to mankind to pool the efforts of all and  finally  offer the prospect of universal peace and progress."
"44",2090,"ECU",42,1987,"﻿It gives me great pleasure  Sir  to congratulate you most sincerely on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session. I am convinced that under your wise leadership the Assembly will reach the satisfactory results all Member States expect and seek.Allow me also to congratulate the President at the forty-first session. Ambassador Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  whose recognized ability and dedication enabled him to succeed in the difficult tasks he performed. We also extend our appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and applaud him for his effective and selfless endeavours at this complex juncture in international relations  particularly the diligent help he extended to my country in the grave circumstances experienced by Ecuador as a result of the disastrous earthquake in March of this year.In this Hall countless highly authoritative voices have said much  if not all ; there is to say  about the peoples' desire for peace  security and economic and; social improvement. Ecuador wishes to state that it shares and warmly supports those statements  and it expresses the hope that the forty-second session of the General Assembly will excel in upholding these oft-repeated and universally acknowledged truths. I wish to highlight certain concepts that are dear to Ecuador in connection with the most important issues debated here and explain the reasoning and attitude behind Ecuador's international policy  one that is constant with ethical and legal standards which cannot fail to nourish the values and aspirations of all men of good will and whose application in good faith could bring about the noble objectives of justice  peace and development.In his recent message to the National Congress on 10 August  the President of the Republic of Ecuador stated that last year had ""witnessed the organic consolidation of a serious international policy  based on ethics and the sound principles of international law; open to co-operation on all valid initiatives in favour of peace  disarmament  justice  human rights and development; inspired by the will to maintain relations with all States of the world  in a spirit of respect and meaningful co-operation.""Those words by the President of Ecuador summarize the basis of our international policy and faithfully reflect Ecuador's actions within the world Organization  whose ideals enshrined in the Charter have  unfortunately  often been contradicted by the harsh reality of international conflicts and their intractable persistence. On the one hand  the politicisation which surfaces in practically all the problems dealt with by the Security Council and the General Assembly and  on the other hand  the tendency for the international community to judge those problems  not always on their own merits  but in the light of group  if not individual  interests  reduce the effectiveness of the system and deprive it of the authority that all its decisions should carry.Given the circumstances in which international relations are evolving and the growing complexity of an ever more interdependent world  it is necessary and urgent for the United Nations to become the effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security that was envisaged at its inception. This transformation requires the concerted efforts of all its organs and all the Governments of the Member States  which should disregard possible ideological victories and strive to arrive at practical results for the solution of conflicts in keeping with the spirit of the Charter  which offers genuine possibilities to this end  for instance the provisions of Article 33 on the peaceful settlement of disputes. Ecuador has participated and will continue to participate in the building and consolidation of international law  which is constantly growing and diversifying. This reflects our feeling that peace is based on the supremacy of law  which Is valid as an invariable rule of conduct for all countries  powerful or weak. No one will fail to notice the existence of a cause and effect relationship between the law and the obligation of States to refrain from the use or threat of force. In this regard  the present General Assembly is to consider a draft declaration  on the recommendation of the Special Committee  to Improve the effectiveness of this fundamental principle. In spite of the draft declaration's shortcomings  Ecuador will support its adoption  which will represent a reaffirmation of the validity and relevance of a principle that is the logical and inseparable corollary of the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes.While it is true that one of the most serious problems facing the world is that of the chasm separating the rich from the poor or underdeveloped countries  it is also a fact that the United Nations constitutes what may be the most important means of launching progressive action in the struggle to eliminate or at least reduce those tragic differences.The International Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development  which met here just a short time ago  requires a mighty effort towards the ideal of the struggle against underdevelopment since  as is acknowledged in the Final Document of the Conference ""The global military expenditures are in dramatic contrast to economic and social underdevelopment and to the misery and poverty afflicting more than two thirds of mankind."" (A/CQNF. 130/21  para.3) That fearful spending I amounting to almost a trillion dollars each year  could help eliminate hunger  ignorance  sickness  insecurity and fear in one generation. It follows that Ecuador  a country with an undeniable pacifist mission  is deeply concerned at the unbridled arras race  which involves a sizeable portion of the world. States obviously have a right to preserve their own security  but that logical right cannot and must not justify the costly excesses of acquiring lethal devices that threaten the life and health of large portions of the human population and deplete resources needed for development.Ecuador is opposed  as it has demonstrated on several occasions  to all attempts at undue stockpiling. It follows that it supports proposals to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones  among which that sponsored by the Treaty of Thatelolco for Latin America is a good practical example.Disarmament is an objective essential to the future of mankind. My Government therefore welcomes the news that the Secretary of State of the United States and the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union have reached an accord whereby they have agreed in principle to sign a treaty for the total elimination of medium-range missiles.Ecuador has also learned with satisfaction that intensive efforts will be made to arrive at a treaty on a 50 per cent reduction in offensive strategic weapons  that talks are to begin before 1 December on questions relating to nuclear tests and that a summit meeting between President Reagan and General-Secretary Gorbachev has been agreed for autumn of this year.This entire process deserves the support of my Government  which understands how difficult the negotiations ate and appreciates the value of the efforts made by the parties directly concerned  thanks to which it has been possible to reach this prized objective. Aware that this agreement makes an essential contribution to peace and understanding and helps dispel distrust  the Government of Ecuador expresses the hope that the fruitful work of these great Powers will continue until general and complete disarmament is attained  thus giving mankind the confidence it needs to move forward towards achievement of its well-being.The inestimable gift of peace is being seriously affected in various parts of the world. In the Middle East  in Africa and in Central America  death and devastation are present. Each day  many innocent human beings are the victims of wars and of guerrilla and terrorist acts in which they are caught up by the cruel force of fate. Yet  despite their painful train of horror and tragedy  such events are of small significance compared to a nuclear holocaust which  regrettably  represents a dire threat to the very survival of mankind.Never has such great responsibility rested on any group of countries as that which today falls on the nuclear Powers. It is necessary and urgent that they hear- and respond to the anguished call to bury these unspeakable weapons - a call that springs from the elementary right to life of millions of human beings. Moreover  conventional disarmament  still slow and scarcely regional in scope   should also progress in step with the concern of the international community  which is searching for collective peace and security. This  however  will not easily be achieved so long as there remain political antagonisms  extremist ideologies and the serious economic crisis that besets the great majority of the Members of the Organization.Peace cannot prosper without the peaceful and just solution of the problems existing between States. Faithful to its constant policy of firm respect for the norms of international law and the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  Ecuador reiterates its resolve to maintain and strengthen friendly relations with all nations  and most particularly with its neighbours  in order thus to· contribute to the progress and well-being of peoples who were meant to live in unity and understanding  thereby creating a favourable climate for the just/ peaceful and honourable solution of territorial or other disputes that divide them.Latin America has just demonstrated its political will to move forward and deepen the process of integration. Every day we see more clearly the need to agree on policies and to act jointly on many issues of common interest. We all face the challenge of eliminating the differences that separate us and strengthening the ties that bind us. Territorial problems also infringe on the spirit of brotherhood which we want to strengthen  and their solution by legal means will definitively clear the way to understanding.In Latin America  there is a strengthening and growing climate of solidarity and a firm determination to apply joint efforts to development. There is an increased firmness in the spirit of unity which expresses itself as a thirst for integration and a determination to achieve co-operation and friendship. This implies the establishment of a climate of trust  the laying of solid foundations for justice and a determination to move towards the settlement of disputes. The rest will be achieved because we are aware of a shared destiny and are determined to achieve the well-being of our peoples.	The growing dimension of the crisis resulting from the enormous debt of the developing countries is well known  as are its grave consequences for their capabilities in the short  medium and long term and the real risk it poses to their political and social stability. The road to growth of their economies is blocked by the difficulties and cost of foreign credit and by the closing of markets to their new production. The stifling of their economies warns of repercussions still graver than at present. That is so clear that it would be absurd for creditors to fail to understand their joint responsibility in solving a problem of such magnitude that it will  if left unsolved  drag along with it debtors and creditors to avoid this; a clear and courageous decision is called for on the part of the creditor Powers to make good their political will and to make ą significant contribution to the basic development of the debtor countries. Multilateral projects administered by the United Nations must be increased  along with credits and technology transfers  with special emphasis placed on the opening of the markets of the industrial countries in both East and West to the products and raw materials of the developing countries through the removal of restrictive barriers which create unjust situations and jeopardize the economic  political and social stability of the latter countries.Ecuador's international policy is firmly based on respect for human rights and on their promotion and universal protection. We have pointed out that the general nature of the standards of protection of such rights cannot be distorted by selective and discriminatory criteria inspired by reasons of politics or ideology.We advocate the need to improve the international machinery for monitoring human rights in all countries of the world. We maintain that the international bodies inquiring into the human rights situation must consider it independently of political systems in order to avoid discriminating against certain countries while Keeping silent about what happens in others. We believe it is necessary to create conditions for the true exercise of rights  taking Into account the requirements of well-being  culture and health. The denial of such rights  whether within a country or internationally  is an infringement of justice and renders freedom illusory  while weakening the democratic nature and social and political stability of countries experiencing deep-seated development problems. We consider the right to development to be an inalienable human right.At sessions of the General Assembly the delegation of Ecuador has abstained in the voting on draft resolutions condemning only certain countries  and has stressed the need to seek new mechanisms to ensure impartiality and universality in dealing with this matter.Particular mention deserves to be made of my country's absolute rejection of that violation of human rights that exists and persists so shamefully in South Africa in spite of the countless appeals and words of condemnation that have been and are being voiced within this Organization. I am referring to the detestable system of apartheid. The burden of inhuman racial discrimination which it imposes must be removed for the sake of the dignity  equality and brotherhood of man.Ecuador respects the rights of human beings  men and women  and condemns all  discrimination  be it based on sex  religion or race  or on nationality and political ideology.It is incumbent upon Governments to make a gigantic effort to resolve the socio-economic problems besetting the developing societies  small societies in particular. This takes time. It is not possible fully to satisfy the just demands for a way of life that affords the rights inherent in human dignity so long as such basic issues as education  health and housing are  for the most part  financed with capital from abroad and  therefore  dependent upon the co-operation of the international financial centres.The neglect of long-deferred needs creates social tension and disorientation in certain sectors. It must be acknowledged that when violent and extremist groups are present  alienated from organized society and disoriented with respect to the future  they form nuclei that proliferate with the help of organizations in other countries. For this reason the problems of urban violence and guerrilla warfare do note a rule concern one country alone. In Ecuador we aspire to preserve social peace  which  fortunately  we have managed to preserve. We are  nevertheless  aware of the danger that the presence of guerrillas in other countries represents. My country is particularly interested in joining those countries in an effort to eradicate that wretched evil  which is often linked to drug trafficking. This is another cause for social alienation to which my country also calls the attention of the international community  and we state our sincere wish to contribute to the fight against those evils.Terrorism and drug trafficking have aroused the concern of the United Nations and of such regional bodies as the Organization of American States. Ecuador Is a member of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs and has signed several conventions on the same subject  with the United States  Colombia and Peru  Moreover  it is actively co-operating with the Andean Group's Convention on Drug Trafficking and the South American Agreement on Narcotics  drawn up by international bodies to which It belongs. With the recent International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking the international community took a step forward in the struggle against this grave danger that threatens it. Averting this danger will require a firm decision on the part of the drug-producing countries  as well as the persistent and effective action of consumer countries  which are a source of incalculable revenue for this international crime. Ecuador takes this opportunity to reiterate its firm determination to maintain close relations of friendship  co-operation and understanding with all nations. The Government of Ecuador reaffirms its decision to continue to co-operate with the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and will work for the preservation of the principles of autonomy and impartiality which prompted Its establishment. We consider that the action of the non-aligned countries must reflect true Independence and an endeavour to maintain international peace and security and to promote the economic and social development of members of the Movement. What I have said does not imply any Intent to detract from the overall authority of the United Nations to the advantage of the groups established within the Organization. As one of its founding Members  Ecuador maintains its unfaltering faith in the principles and purposes that inspire the United Nations and  for that reason  it has always held that universality is an essential condition for its efficiency and success.Consequently  Ecuador would welcome  for Instance  the admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations without prior conditions for their admission. It also views as positive the efforts to work out bilateral agreements leading to understandings in favour of the Korean people  of international peace and of co-operation.Ecuador's devotion to peace is reflected in its persistent adherence to the principles and resolutions of the world Organization to preserve or restore peace. It therefore expresses its unstinting support for the efforts to end the cruel war between Iran and Iraq and  in particular  for the Secretary-General's tireless efforts in this respect.To the same purpose  and in support of all initiatives for the peaceful settlement of conflicts  we reiterate our backing for Contadora and its Support Group  in their attempts to arrive at solutions to the Central American crisis and avoid the outbreak of a general war. We believe that the solution requires the political will of all parties  that it is necessary to make constant efforts and not to exclude opportunities for negotiation  that it is essential to obtain the withdrawal of foreign forces and to rid the situation of the explosive ingredients of East-West confrontation. We also consider that the existence of an authentic democracy in the region will make understanding possible among countries and Governments and help overcome the distressing problems of the area. For this reason Ecuador has welcomed with hope and satisfaction the agreement signed by the five Central American countries on 7 August last in Guatemala  which opens the way to peace  democracy and freedom for that group of sister countries. On October 1986  the British Government declared a 150-mtle exclusive zone around the Malvinas Islands  the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry made known its opposition and  having reiterated its support for the Argentine claims  declared that such illegal actions make it difficult to arrive at a favourable climate for negotiations which would guarantee peace in the region and allow for the conversion of the South Atlantic into a zone of co-operation and understanding.In the same vein  at the previous session of the General Assembly  Ecuador supported the draft resolution introduced by Brazil  aimed at ensuring the maintenance of peace in the South Atlantic  and backed the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle East.Ecuador unswervingly rejects any occupation of territory by force. It has repeatedly expressed this rejection  in such cases as those of Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Cyprus  Namibia and the Middle East  and supported resolutions of the world Organization condemning them.Ecuador's policy has been equally unswerving with regard to affirming the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. Our resolute anti—colonialist attitude has been clear at all times  and today we reiterate this line of conduct more particularly in the case of sorely tried Namibia. The use of force does not create rights and intervention must be prohibited in International relations.As for outer space  Ecuador and its Government reiterate on this occasion the position they have maintained regarding the geo-stationary orbit and the frequency problem. Such resources are to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all peoples  in particular those of the developing countries  notably the equatorial countries that claim special obligations and rights over the segments of the orbit spanning their territories. Ecuador welcomed the requests to include in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly two new items relating to co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States and between the United Nations and the Latin American Economic System. My country vigorously supports the inclusion of these items  since it is considers that it is high time for close collaboration to be established between the United Nations and the Organization of American States the oldest regional organization  which was a source of inspiration at the San Francisco Conference in 194 5.Over its 42 years of existence the United Nations has had to face harsh conflicts  serious differences among its Members  overweening ambitions  ideological struggles and breaches of the peace and well-being in various parts of the world. In carrying out its activities the Organization has occasionally met with bureaucratic and financial difficulties which  starting at the previous session of the General Assembly  are being reformed and corrected. But we are also bound to acknowledge important achievements in many areas of multilateral relations In this irreplaceable forum  angry words have been heard from time to time  but we have also listened more often to words of peace  conciliation and hope. Let the latter be the words that prevail in future  inspired by faith in the United Nations and by the peoples9 will to build a fraternal world of progress and well-being."
"45",2135,"EGY",42,1987,"﻿It gives me pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  on behalf of the Egyptian delegation and on my own behalf  on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are particularly pleased to see as President a person with renewed skills who comes from a friendly country with which Egypt maintains cordial relations and enjoys mutual understanding.In the same spirit  I avail myself of this opportunity to express our profound thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  for his wise steering of the forty-first session and his invaluable contribution by conducting its proceedings towards the desired objectives. The United Nations  which was born as an expression of humanity's aspirations to peace  security and freedom and whose principles have been beacons on the path to righteousness and justice  still embodies the hopes of many peoples. Forty-two years after its establishment  the United Nations still has a primary role in the maintenance of peace and security and in laying the foundations of relations among States and peoples on the principles of co-operation  solidarity  respect of rights and sovereign equality.The world today is experiencing extremely delicate international conditions  including conflicts which are being exacerbated or are potentially threatening and volatile. Such a state of affairs makes us more supportive of to and more insistent on the need for relations between States to be based on the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We are confident that the United Nations  which has been a principal forum for the maintenance of peace and security since the end of the Second World War  will continue to play its role and confirm its principles  whatever the difficulties or challenges. We believe that peace is indivisible and that security cannot be the monopoly of a few. In the world of today  where interdependence has been enhanced and distances have narrowed  no one can feel secure in isolation from the rest of the international community. At a time when the threat of confrontation between the two super-Powers clouds the entire globe  any progress towards disarmament by them leads to an atmosphere of detente and de-escalation  whose effect extends to several regional conflicts. Therefore  we learned with great interest the news that the two super-Powers had reached agreement in principle on eliminating some types of nuclear weapons. Such enthusiasm on our part results from our firm belief that nuclear weapons constitute the ultimate danger for humanity. Egypt congratulates the two Powers on the success of their efforts in this field  particularly as a ban on such weapons would represent a unique precedent  for it would be the first agreement leading to actual disarmament consistent with the priorities laid down by the international community in that field.We also commend the agreement by the two super-Powers to make urgent and intensified efforts to eliminate intercontinental ballistic missiles  which would ease international tension and decrease the nuclear threat and its grave consequences.Disarmament is an all-embracing issue - one of security and politics as well as development. Indeed  it is the issue of the very survival of mankind. It is now a universally acknowledged truth that the use of weapons of mass destruction would leave neither victor nor vanquished. Consequently  persistence in the arms race is insistence on the futile depletion of the energies and resources of peoples to no avail. In this context  the General Assembly resolution on convening the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was recognition that international security and development are inseparable. It is high time humanity directed its efforts towards construction instead of destruction  development instead of the feverish arms race.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the efforts made to utilize nuclear energy for peaceful purposes are complementary. Egypt invites the international community to intensify its efforts to persuade the States that have not signed the Treaty accede to it.By the same token  Egypt hopes that the Mediterranean will become a nuclear-weapon-free zone and that the Mediterranean sea will continue to be a transit route for trade and culture and a haven of peace and security. In the same vein  Egypt stresses the importance of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Middle East and Africa. Egypt has consistently called for the achievement of those two objectives and has taken the initiative of submitting specific proposals to this end. it may be appropriate to appeal from this rostrum to the States of the region and the big Powers to adopt positions and take measures conducive to translating those objectives into facts in the near future.The Iraq-Iran war is at present the centre of conflict and a source of danger in the Middle East. This should in no way blind us to the fact that the Palestine question is the core of the conflict in our part of the world. Despite the passage of time or the flare-up of conflicts in the region  it remains the main source of danger and the underlying cause of tension and turbulence. Peace can never be established  nor can it last  as long as the Palestinian people are deprived of their legitimate national rights  foremost among which is their right to self-determination on their national soil.Egypt  which has been committed to the Palestinian question ever since it emerged  is no less committed to it today; nor will it ever shirk its responsibility regarding it. Our commitment to the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people is the essence of our endeavours to establish a just and comprehensive peace in our region. We seek to establish peace based on recognition of the legitimate rights of all parties. While the attainment of peace requires that each party make an effort and accept the spirit of settlement and justice  we believe that peace would be an asset to all parties. Conversely  the persistence of tension and conflict is of no benefit to anyone rather  it means loss for everyone.The lapse of 20 years since Israel occupied the Arab territories in 1967 and the continued rejection by the Palestinian people of that occupation confirm the need for the establishment of comprehensive peace based on justice and the restoration of the legitimate rights of those deprived of them  within a framework that ensures mutual security and recognition of the right of all States in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and of the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory through war.History and experience teach us that the rights of peoples cannot be waived by proscription or vanish through oblivion. We also know that although force may impose a fait accompli it does not grant security or establish peace  and that justice alone is the way to peace. We also realize that peace requites persistence and resolve  and that we should not lose the possible in pursuit of the impossible. We should seize every available opportunity and each propitious occasion. We should nurture every bud until it bears the fruit of justice  security and peace.Egypt has pursued its relentless efforts world-wide so that 19 8 7 may be the year of peace through negotiations between the parties within the context of an international peace conference. These endeavours  supported by the sincere efforts made by other parties  have led to what may be tantamount to an international consensus in support of the idea Of convening an international conference. In this regard  I wish to place on record our appreciation of the support expressed by the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the European Community and the countries of the Nordic Council. That such support contributed greatly to the evolution of this international consensus - so much so that the convening of the international conference has become a real possibility  indeed  the only option  after being only an idea that lacked support.In this context  I wish  in the name of the Arab Republic of Egypt  to commend the Secretary-General for his sincere efforts in exploring the views of the parties concerned and those of the big Powers on the convening of the international peace conference  and for his ideas and suggestions  which have received our full attention and appreciation.Egypt realizes that any attempt to impose a fait accompli and maintain the status quo portends serious dangers and grave consequences. There is no alternative but to act seriously and consistently to give an impetus to the peace process. In this respect  I must emphasize the following points.First  Egypt's commitment to the cause of the Palestinian people and their legitimate national rights is genuine  firm and unswerving. Egypt also reaffirms that the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO) is the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.Secondly  Egypt honours and fulfils its international obligations  abides by them and never ignores them.Thirdly  the international peace conference has become the possible and acceptable formula for the resumption of the peace drive. It is necessary that all efforts are concerted to persuade the parties that reject this idea that the time has come for an attitude in favour of exploring the prospects of a new era  free from strife and war) an era in which peace would reign supreme. Fourthly  Egypt believes that  to ensure that the international conference is credible and efficient  it should be held under the auspices of the United Nations. Its terms of reference should be Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  as well as the rights of the Palestinian people. It should be attended by all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  with due attention to the composition of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. It should be attended  also  by the five permanent members of the Security Council  in view of their responsibilities regarding international peace and security in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Finally  it should be an effective framework for direct negotiations on all the elements of the Palestinian question and the rights related thereto  and on the Middle East problem  of which the Palestinian question is the essence.In the name of Egypt  I call upon all peace-loving Powers throughout the world  to muster their determination and intensify their efforts with a view to speeding up the attainment of a comprehensive and just settlement of the conflict in the Middle East. The progress made so far towards acceptance of the convening of an international conference may well be an incentive and an impetus for all of us to maintain the momentum and pursue the peace drive to its desired objective. Lebanon has continued to experience regrettable developments in a most peculiar and protracted civil war  in which responsibility has been lost amid successive incidents. Although the Lebanese issue may well be one result of the freeze on the Palestinian question  we call upon all concerned to lift their hands from Lebanon so that the brother people of Lebanon may have the opportunity to heal their wounds  close their ranks and work together for true national reconciliation that will restore peace and security to the country and enable the friendly people of Lebanon to lead a normal life and assume their distinctive Arab and cultural role.The confrontation and conflict afflicting the Gulf region are being exacerbated day by day and further deterioration is threatened. The situation in the Gulf has become a source of grave international tension and causes profound concern to all peace-loving nations yearning for stability. Unfortunately  such a situation is the natural outcome of the Iran-Iraq war  which for the eighth successive year is draining the energies  potential and blood of the two brother peoples. The war has hindered development and progress  claimed almost a million lives from both countries and depleted their great potentialities. Furthermore  its ramifications have spilled over into the whole Gulf region and impeded international navigation through the Gulf.Egypt expressed full support for Security Council resolution 598 (1987) immediately after its adoption. We still believe in the imperative need for its implementation as we view the termination of this war as the unique solution to the precarious situation in the Gulf waters and on its shores  a situation which places in jeopardy one of the most important sources of energy in the world. We view the resolution as an integral and comprehensive whole  in keeping with international legitimacy. It should be implemented in its entirety within a reasonable time-frame that would neither detract from its content nor lead to its fragmentation. It would be no exaggeration to say that the implementation of this resolution will be a litmus test of the credibility of international legitimacy and the ability to carry out a decision adopted unanimously by the organ with the highest authority. I wish to commend our sister Iraq for its prompt response to the legitimate decisions of the international community. We call on Iran to support this international drive towards a just peace that would give everyone his due and herald an era of peaceful coexistence that would make amends for the material and human losses incurred during the eight years of war. In this regard  I wish to express our support for the efforts being exerted by the United Nations Secretary-General and to invite all parties to give their genuine  effective support to his endeavours and efforts. I also wish to emphasize that we consider the security of our brothers in the Gulf States as part and parcel of Egypt's security·The international community is at present confronted with a serious phenomenon which brushes aside all values recognized and cherished by the civilized community and threatens its peace and security·The spate of violence and terrorism does not constitute a material threat to the safety of individuals and peoples as much as it represents a grave ideological trend that makes the use of violence both a means and an end  rejects pluralism of opinions  and bars free dialogue and constructive coexistence.Recently  terrorist activities have been rampant and have expanded to encompass locations dear to our heart and  at the same time# sacred places which enjoy sanctity and command the reverence of hundreds of millions of people throughout the world· These incidents have indicated that the threat of terrorism is still lurking and that it attacks when an opportunity presents itself· It also exceeds all limits when we loosen our grip or when we are beguiled into entertaining good intentions. As the issue of terrorism is included in the agenda of the current session  I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate Egypt's view that it is imperative to tackle the phenomenon of terrorism in all its aspects and guises  its causes and roots should be traced with a view to concluding a comprehensive treaty that would fill the loopholes existing in international instruments which seek to deal with some aspects of this problem· Countries that have not acceded to existing agreements should be invited to do so as soon as possible and to incorporate the provisions of these agreements in their domestic legislation  taking due account of the right of peoples and recognized liberation movements to their national struggle for freedom and independence· The principles on which the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries was based are still relevant and valid. The Movement represents a political expression by third world countries of their incessant struggle for freedom and independence. It is also a positive contribution to the maintenance of international peace and the alleviation of tensions. In view of its historical responsibility as one of the founding members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  Egypt finds it imperative to preserve the concepts and principles on which the Movement is based. It also considers it essential to take a firm stand against all claims towards extremism and exaggeration which tend to divert the Movement from its original path and sublime principles. In this regard  we wish to pay a tribute to the non-aligned countries for their enlightened awareness of  their firm commitment to  and their success  in preserving the genuine principles of non-alignment despite pressure and difficulties. Such an attitude was best demonstrated during the summit meetings of non-aligned countries at New Delhi in 1983 and at Harare in 1986 If the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries is the political expression of third world countries  the Group of 77 is an expression of the hopes and aspirations of the developing countries for a more equitable international economic order. It is also an endeavour to confirm and consolidate co-operation and collective self-reliance among developing countries.Egypt has an authentic affiliation to the Islamic world. That affiliation is essentially a belief in the message of Islam  which advocates that human beings are equal  that there is no preference for an Arab over a non-Arab or for a black over a white except on the basis of piety  and that there can be no duress in religion or opinion. Islam is a heavenly message of justice and peace; a call for righteousness and benevolence} a mode of freedom and democracy. It is regrettable and disheartening that the Islamic world is turned into a scene of sanguinary strife between some of its States and that it witnesses attempts to distort the image of Islam  flagrantly and untruthfully clothing it in violence and bigotry  as was demonstrated in the recent incidents in Holy Mecca.Egypt's return to active participation in the work of the Organization of the Islamic Conference has been a propitious occasion for it to co-ordinate its efforts with those of sister Islamic nations in taking a firm stand against the challenges facing the Islamic world and the dangers to which it is exposed.The deteriorating situation in which our African brothers in southern Africa are living under the yoke of the racist policies of the Pretoria regime  and the persistence of that regime in illegally occupying Namibia in disregard of the aspirations of its people and their right to self-determination and independence  all warrant profound concern and constitute a flagrant defiance of the will of all peace-loving peoples.There is no doubt that the scandalous and shameless endeavours by the South African Government  whether through the so-called constitutional reforms or through resort to aggression and military blackmail against neighbouring African States  are acts of hooliganism  which deserve rejection and condemnation. Guided by its African responsibilities and in evidence of its solidarity with its brotherly Africans  Egypt reiterates that it stands firmly and unwaveringly behind the people of South Africa in their struggle for their human and indigenous right to equality and freedom  it also supports the legitimate struggle of the people of Namibia  under the leadership of their legitimate  authentic representative  the South West Africa People's Organization  until they gain full independence. Egypt also calls for the support of the front-line States against threats and aggression. Egypt appeals to the Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards the peoples of southern African in order to enable them to lead a dignified life like all other free and independent peoples. The Security Council should make full use of all its powers  including the imposition of sanctions against that inhuman regime.In this regard  I wish to mention the positive development in Western public opinion and in the attitude of Western countries towards the abominable racist policies of the South African Government  an attitude which heightens the isolation of that regime and hastens its downfall.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  there is no alternative before us but squarely to face the problems that hinder the march of peace  co-operation and development.If we state that the Middle East and southern Africa are hotbeds of bitter struggle between obsolete concepts and forward-looking prospects  we cannot  however  ignore other problems that afflict various regions  such as the problem of Cyprus in the Mediterranean  that of Afghanistan in south-west Asia  Korea in East Asia  Kampuchea in South-East Asia and other problems in Central America.As for Cyprus  there is no alternative to a solution that takes into consideration the inalienable and legitimate rights of all Cypriots on an equal footing in the interest of preserving the unity of the island  its independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status. As regards Afghanistan  we fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to arrive at a just settlement of the Afghan problem. Such a settlement of the problem  while respecting Afghanistan's independence  should be based on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory  putting an end to interference in its internal affairs and ensuring its non-alignment. In this context Egypt supports all serious initiatives calling for the early withdrawal of foreign troops and the restoration of peace and stability to the brotherly people of Afghanistan.On Korea  we reaffirm our sympathy with  and support for  the legitimate aspirations of the Koreas for a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula and the attainment of stability arid security in the area. We invite them to engage in a serious dialogue towards that end.In the same spirit  we reiterate that Egypt views respect for Kampuchea's independence as an important element for stability in South-East Asia.As for Central America  Egypt welcomed the agreement reached recently among the States of the region. We also support the efforts of the Contadora Group and Support Groups to achieve peace and stability in Central America. Egypt reiterates its call for respect for good-neighbourliness and for existing frontiers among all the countries of the region} non-interference in their internal affairs·  preservation of the rights  interests and aspirations of the peoples of the region and refraining from policies of provocation and counter-attempts at polarization. We hope that the recent agreement will culminate in a durable settlement putting an end to tension and enabling the peoples of the region to forge ahead to an era of co-operation and development under the banner of democracy.As the decade of the 1980s draws to a close  it is observed that the accomplishments of the international community in the field of economic relations have been so disappointing that some tend to call it ""the lost development decade"". The international economic crisis has reached immense proportions. As President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak said in his address before the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UKCTAD)  the debt problem ""has reached serious proportions that cannot be ignored  threatening grave consequences unless the international community  debtors and creditors alike  take effective action"". In addition to the debt problem  there are the issues of deterioration in terms of trade  the fall in commodity prices  reduced official development assistance flows  high interest rates  fluctuations of exchange rates and the net transfer of resources from developing to developed countries.The international economic crisis has placed the developing countries in general  and the African countries in particular  before grave challenges. It has condemned their peoples to live under arduous conditions. We therefore must take serious action in order to cope with those conditions and resolve those problems at the earliest possible time.Against this bleak picture  there are some indications offering a flicker of hope that logic may be sought and wisdom resorted to in coping with those vital and urgent economic issues. Such indications were demonstrated mainly in the Final Act adopted by consensus at UNCTAD VII voicing the determination of all participating parties  developed and developing alike  to assume their responsibilities and honour their obligations in tackling this crushing crisis. Such an attitude deserves our encouragement  coupled with a reaffirmation by all of us of our obligations as contained in the Final Act of UNCTAD VII.The United Nations was established to maintain peace among nations and preserve their freedom and independence. From the beginning  it realized that the freedom of nations is essentially based on the freedom of individuals. It was equally aware that violation of the freedom of citizens in their own countries was an extension of a policy which was heedless of law and morality in international relations. Thus the International Declaration on Human Rights represented a moral obligation which transcended borders and restrictions and made the protection of man's rights and freedom a preoccupation of the international community and of humanity at large.Nothing is more outrageous than aggression against human rights which denies the rights of entire peoples  as is the case with regard to the policy of apartheid in South Africa. Another example is the Palestinian people  which have been denied the right to self-determination and whose basic rights are violated under occupation - rights bestowed on them by their Creator and emphasized in various international pacts.Egypt has always been in the forefront of countries that advocate respect for human rights and the rights of peoples. Egypt made an outstanding contribution to the formulation of the International Declaration on Human Rights.In the past six years Egypt  under President Mubarak  has made substantial progress in the field of respect for human rights. During this period Egypt ratified six international instruments related to respect for human rights in various spheres  and they have become part of our legal system.Since January 1982 Egypt has ratified the following instruments: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights; the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid; the Convention against Torture; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the African Charter of Human and People's Rights.Egypt's ratification of those instruments was not mere form devoid of content? Hot was it simply an attempt to go along with the wishes of the international community. Rather  it was the reflection of a wide-ranging and profound democratic development experienced by Egypt and enjoyed by its people. The Egyptian political scene is now characterized by pluralism of opinion and freedom of political and intellectual expression under the umbrella of the Constitution and the rule of law that treat the ruler and the ruled on an equal footing  supported by an independent judiciary system that ensures justice and applies the law.The Egyptian people will soon embark cm a new and glorious phase of democratic development when they elect their President through a free public referendum  in a climate of freedom and stability  coupled with their aspirations for development  progress and peace.I have dwelt on the great hopes we entertain in our constant pursuit of justice and morality  progress and advancement. I have also spoken of the difficulties and perils hindering out drive. May the rays of hope dissipate feelings of despair and the world leave behind the setting sun of the twentieth century and on solid ground forge ahead in a new spirit to welcome the rising sun of the next century  so that humanity may enjoy an era of peace security  stability and prosperity. "
"46",2205,"ESP",42,1987,"﻿May I first of all congratulate Mr. Florin on behalf of my delegation on having been elected to preside over the work of the current session of the Assembly. I am convinced that under his expert guidance  we shall be able to bring to a successful conclusion the important tasks before us.I also wish to express our gratitude for the tireless and fruitful work done by his predecessor  Mr. Choudhury. I should also like on this occasion to reiterate our full support for the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who last year was unanimously elected to a new term of office in a post full of challenges - challenges which he has faced and continues to face with courage and Imagination.There has been much talk in the past few years about the crisis of multilateralism. We Member States have collectively pondered the reasons and remedies for that phenomenon. In my opinion  the problem is not so much that the multilateral organizations are imperfect as that there is insufficient political will on the part of Member States to help them fulfil their aims.In the case of our Organization  we are faced with the need to find within ourselves a capacity for renewed and shared determination to lend all our support to this collective project. We must go about this realistically  mindful of the changes that have taken place over the past 40 years - changes that call for greater sobriety and efficiency in the day-to-day running of the Organization. In this way  we will keep alive the spirit that attended the founding of the United Nations and the ideals of peace  justice and solidarity referred to at the last session of the General Assembly by His Majesty the King of Spain.There is no point in inventing an imaginary  idyllic world. We must take as our starting-point the real world  where there are wars  death  starvation and injustice and where freedom and peace still remain a mere hope. We must start from this reality and quite simply try to ensure that this world is inhabitable by the end of the twentieth century.In order to achieve that aim  we must deal with three different sets of issues; those relating to security and disarmament; those having to do with the international economic system; and those concerned with the protection of human rights. I shall deal with each of these in turn.The work of the Assembly is influenced every year by the general climate prevailing in international life  but also - in a very special way - by the state of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Spain is glad to see the improvement that has taken place in these relations and the positive character of the dialogue currently in progress.We believe that détente requires the fostering of confidence among States. This will not come about in the absence of guarantees for the security of all of them  we  for our part  hold to the conviction that security in the world today can and should be achieved on the basis of  among other things  a balance of forces at the lowest possible level. We are convinced that it is possible to move towards a more secure world without this necessarily implying that it will be a more heavily armed world.We are therefore pleased that the Geneva negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union have led to an agreement in principle on the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear systems. There is no historical precedent so far for agreements of this nature  which may well reinforce the positive trend opened up in East-West relations. Spain has from the outset sought to promote the achievement of these agreements and will support every effort to secure further agreements which are both necessary and possible in such fields as strategic weapons  space defence and the banning of nuclear tests.Despite its importance  the reduction of nuclear weapons will not by itself generate a satisfactory level of security. A treaty must be rapidly concluded to bring about the total eradication of chemical weapons. Moreover  Spain looks with concern upon the extraordinary accumulation of conventional forces and weapons on European territory - as well as their serious asymmetry. It is therefore urgent that negotiations be undertaken with a view to eliminating these disparities  ensuring conventional stability at lower levels and making large-scale offensives and surprise attacks impossible.All these agreements must be accompanied by verification procedures to ensure compliance  thus increasing the confidence needed to strengthen détente. As Europeans  we attach the greatest importance to the improvement of East-West relations. We shall therefore make every effort to ensure that the work of the current session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Vienna contributes to the Implementation of the commitments undertaken thus far in all fields and develops them further.My Government has repeatedly stressed its determination to preserve Spain's status as a non-nuclear country. That intention has also been ratified by a decision taken in a national referendum and will be legally completed with Spain's imminent accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) . The sovereign decision by the Spanish people not to acquire nuclear weapons of its own and not to permit the nuclear weapons of third parties to be brought on its territory - or deployed or stockpiled there - is thus confirmed.We hope that our accession to the NPT will help to strengthen politically the non-proliferation regime  both horizontally and vertically. All the issues that face us in the field of security and disarmament must elicit a suitable response from this General Assembly  thus paving the way for the forthcoming third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.In this context  we welcome the results achieved at the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. Perhaps our greatest historical piece of folly - one for which we will be held accountable by future generations - is the scandalous squandering of resources on increasingly sophisticated weapons  when the threshold of total destruction was passed long ago and while immense areas of the planet are still sunk in hunger and misery.The second point to which I have referred is the clarification and restructuring of economic relations. This is another of the great challenges facing the international community.According to the latest United Nations world economic survey  a slowing down of the world economy has taken place for the second year in a row. Moreover  most of the developing countries have not experienced sustained growth and many of them are heading for stagnation in the medium term. Nor is the instability recorded in numerous markets for goods and services very encouraging. In real terms  commodity prices are at their lowest level for the past 50 years and there are no signs that improvement is about to take place.Since interdependence is an inescapable reality  both developed and developing countries alike share a responsibility to work for the stability of the system as a whole and to seek pragmatic solutions. The developed countries can do this by adopting policies that favour economic growth and access to markets  and the developing countries by implementing appropriate adjustment policies that foster sustained non-inflationary growth. In this context official development assistance also plays an important part. For the last few years Spain has been endeavouring to increase its contribution to the extent possible.It is out hope that at this session the General Assembly will tackle economic issues with both determination and realism  seeking in the most intractable issues the lowest common denominator acceptable to all  as was the case last year following the promising special session on the economic situation in Africa  but without shying away from imaginative solutions or objectives  which are vital in the long run. The recent example of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII)  at which  after painstaking efforts by all delegations  it was possible to obtain moderately satisfactory results  should prompt us to hold even more strongly to that constructive spirit during the current session.The problem of external debt continues to be one of the most pressing matters the developing countries have to face  particularly in the Latin American region. At the same time it also affects the functioning of the international financial system as a whole. I wish to stress here in the Assembly the doctrine that creditors and debtors have a shared responsibility to solve the debt problem.So long as we are incapable of generating sustained growth for the developing countries and helping to co-ordinate the economic policies that will make it possible  so long as those countries are unable to increase their domestic savings and have to live in stagnation  there will be social and even moral limits to their adjustment policies  for it is not possible to follow indefinitely the example of Sisyphus  who pushed the rock up the mountain every morning only to see it roll back down in the afternoon and had to push it back up the next day. It is necessary to build up real hope with real measures  for this is a real problem involving not financial figures but the human beings behind them. Positive action is required  such as more favourable rescheduling  trade liberalization  fair prices  increased resources made available to multilateral agencies and aid for development through an effective transfer of technologies and resources.Spain supports such a policy and has advocated and will advocate in every forum a policy aimed at dialogue  such as was called for here by the Spanish Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez.I now come to the third issue to which I referred earlier - the defence  promotion and protection of human rights. This is a field in which the United Nations has in the course of its existence tirelessly persevered in an attempt to establish new commitments and respond with determination to unavoidable challenges. The codification of those rights has been perfected and at the same time effective arrangements have been established for the monitoring of the obligations states have entered into in this field. All this has helped to bring to maturity a universal ethical conscience such that the community of nations cannot remain indifferent to the massive and systematic violation of those rights. In such cases there can be no question of resorting to the argument of national sovereignty and non-intervention in the Internal affairs of other States.It is encouraging to note the progress that has been made in defining and developing legal norms  in particular in respect of the monitoring machinery that has been set up. There is  however  still much to be done in both fields  especially in the area of the effective monitoring of respect for human rights and concrete solidarity with those social sectors that continue to be subjected to indiscriminate repression or marginalization.The recent entry into force of the Convention against Torture is an important step in this direction. Spain will ratify it as soon as the parliamentary procedures  which are already far advanced  are complete. It is Intended that that ratification will be accompanied by the declarations provided for in articles 21 and 22 of the Convention  since it is felt that to monitor compliance effectively requires recognition of the jurisdiction of the Committee of Experts set up for that purpose.While addressing the social and humanitarian sphere  I wish to stress the capital importance of the recent Vienna Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. No one can disregard the increasingly alarming magnitude of this problem  which has now reached worldwide proportions. Its extremely grave repercussions are not merely of a social and economic nature; they are also relate to the notion of security  in view of the links of this phenomenon with others  such as arms trafficking or terrorism  in the impenetrable and powerful networks o international black money  we are convinced that only close international co-operation will make it possible for the illicit traffic in drugs to be combated and their consumption eradicated.Terrorism is also taking on a worldwide dimension. It is a scourge that threatens us all and that we must all work together to eradicate. The United Nations  which has already promoted several conventions designed to combat terrorism in the legal sphere  has also taking a far-reaching step In political terms by adopting by consensus General Assembly resolution 40/61  which expresses unreservedly the most uncompromising condemnation of terrorism. This extremely encouraging development must not  however  remain as an isolated declaratory gesture. The consensus achieved must be maintained and broadened by devising recommendations and measures in the various sectoral areas.The task of protecting human rights  which is a vital imperative at this point in history  takes on its maximum significance when those rights are institutionally breached. Racial discrimination  which is always odious and incompatible with the very notion of human dignity  appears in all its starkness in our time with the apartheid system instituted and perpetuated by the South African regime. The international community must once again make it clear beyond all doubt that that system must be totally eradicated once and for all. In this context  we note with grave concern the continuing refusal of Pretoria to commence a genuine internal political dialogue with the representatives of the black majority. Having analysed the major challenges facing the international community  1 shall now go on  as have some of my colleagues  to discuss some of the regional problems with which the Organization has to deal. If the maintaining of the apartheid system is the result of the purblind reactionary policy of the Pretoria Government  it must be admitted that in the last few months the grave state of tension that prevails in southern Africa has been "" deteriorating and that responsibility for the instability in the area also lies with the Republic of South Africa. Spain condemns the attempts to destabilize South Africa's neighbours by means of: a policy of military and economic aggression. Moreover  the situation in Namibia  characterized as it is by the maintaining of a colonial relationship and racial discrimination  has still not been channelled along the paths repeatedly called for by this Organization  through the application  without delay or excuse  of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the concomitant independence of the Territory. With regard to the Middle East  it is a positive sign to see the almost universal acceptance by the international community of the principle of convening an international conference. In the present circumstances this is the only formula likely to make it possible to achieve a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement of the conflict. Such a settlement should be based upon withdrawal by Israel from the occupied Arab territories  respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination  and the security of all the States in the region  including Israel  within internationally recognized frontiers. The conference  which must be open to participation by all the parties involved and concerned in the conflict  will certainly have to be approached painstakingly and realistically. But it would not seem appropriate to delay convening it. Spain hopes that all the parties involved will make an effort to overcome the obstacles that still stand in the way of such a conference. Meanwhile  Spain is following with growing concern the deterioration in the human rights situation in the territories occupied by Israel  and the increasing number of illegal settlements there. Such action and behaviour has a negative effect on the peace process in the region.In Lebanon there are tragic recurrences of episodes of bloodshed that impede the necessary peaceful community life of a country which deserves a better fate and whose unity  independence and territorial integrity must be safeguarded. We are also concerned about the sufferings of the Palestinian refugees  aggravated as they are by the internal situation in the camps resulting from the attacks from outside to which they are subjected.	On the long and bloody war between Iran and Iraq  the Organization took an important step when the Security Council unanimously approved resolution 598 (1987). I reiterate our full support for the Secretary-General  who is continuing to make efforts to bring closer together the positions of the parties to the conflict. We believe that resolution 598 (1987) is balanced and realistic. We urge both parties to express without reservation of any kind their willingness to implement the decisions of the Council in their entirety.We are concerned  moreover  at the recent escalation of the war and call for the immediate imposition of a cease-fire on the various fronts. We also condemn the intolerable attacks on free navigation in the waters of the Gulf. The question of Cyprus continues to be a very dangerous source of tension in an area that is already deeply troubled. We continue to urge a compromise which will fully guarantee the unity  sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and enable the two communities on the Island to live together in peace.  Spain regards the Maghreb as a region of priority Interest and is endeavouring to make a comprehensive and active contribution to harmony and cooperation among all the countries in the area. For this reason  the persistence of the Western Sahara conflict continues to give cause for concern. Spain supports the Secretary-General's efforts to use his good offices to reach a negotiated settlement In accordance with United Nations resolutions. The outcome of such a settlement should be a referendum on self-determination  in accordance with the principles and modalities laid down both by this Organization and by the Organization of African unity to make known the will of the Saharan people.In Afghanistan  the Indirect talks held under the auspices of the Secretary-General have still produced no agreement. The withdrawal of the Soviet troops and respect for the right to self-determination of the Afghan people are the essential elements of a lasting and peaceful solution of the problem. This is the way mapped out by the resolutions adopted  by an overwhelming majority  in the General Assembly year after year.In Kampuchea we are confronted with a similar situation  for in this case  too  we believe that the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops is an essential prerequisite for that country to have the chance to choose in freedom the political system best suited to its interests.The consolidation of the internal processes of democratisation in certain countries in Asia and the Pacific area clearly has an influence beyond those countries and contributes significantly to the stability and security of the region.We Spaniards feel fraternally bound to the peoples of Latin America  and share their aspirations to peace  freedom and justice as if they were our own. It is thus a source of deep satisfaction that  despite the persistence of difficulties democracy is becoming more firmly established  that encouraging steps are being taken towards the settlement of certain conflict situations and that dialogue and co-operation between the Latin American countries is being strengthened. All this highlights the constructive contribution of the Latin American peoples to the cause of peace.As regards the crisis in Central America  we have always maintained that this harrowing conflict is a regional problem the deep-seated causes of which are to be found in the persistence of unjust economic and social structures. Consequently  the solution  which must be a peaceful and negotiated one  must likewise be regional. We still believe  too  that prospects for peace in the area are by no means enhanced by trying to place its problems in the context of the confrontation between the great Powers.We have accordingly encouraged from the outset the activities of the Contadora Group  which has set in motion a process in which its members  together with those of the Support Group  have shown realism and a willingness to engage in dialogue. In the course of this process the Contadora Group and its Support Group have been successful in generating political will and providing a frame of reference for settling the conflict which has secured the support of all the Latin American '· countries  the member countries of the European Economic Community and the vast majority of the international community.The recent signing of the extremely important Guatemala agreement all the Central American countries has made it clear that this effort has not been in vain. But the really decisive factor is that the Central American countries are willing to approach the solution of their problems in a spirit of solidarity  using the instruments of dialogue and negotiation. The steps which have been taken since 7 August underscore the importance of the process under way  the firm political will of the Central American countries to carry it through and the need for them to be able to count on the encouragement and support of the international community. Spain sees this as a one-way journey  in which any external interference would be not only Inadvisable but even rash  jeopardizing the establishment of a definitive peace in the area. For this reason  in reiterating the support of the Spanish Government for the Guatemala agreement we urge the Assembly to express in a clear and forceful way the support of the international community for this agreement.The spirit in which the Central American Presidents have acted has also highlighted the profound desire for peace of the Latin American peoples and their reiterated commitment to negotiation and dialogue as the best way of providing lasting solutions to existing conflicts. We are sure that this same spirit will continue to inform the treatment of all disputes that exist or may arise between them.	 I also wish to refer to the colonial situation of the Malvinas Islands  which remain a source of concern to the international community. This problem can be solved only through negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Argentina leading to the restoration of Argentina’s territorial integrity. This need not entail disregarding the legitimate interests of the population of the islands. It is urgently necessary that such negotiations take place between the two Governments  and we urge them to begin there.There is also a colonial Question which continues to affect my country in a very direct way. The Spanish Government and people are still determined to find a definitive solution to the problem of Gibraltar that will enable the Rock to be restored to our national territory without damaging the interests of the population. With this aim  we are determined to pursue the dialogue with the United Kingdom on the lines of the Brussels Declaration  by which both Governments decided to solve the problem in all its aspects  including the sovereignty aspect  by negotiation. This negotiation necessarily includes political and technical elements  and we are willing to make parallel progress in both fields  although always in the direction marked out years ago by the Assembly of completing the process of decolonisation and restoring Spanish territorial integrity..I began by referring to the alleged crisis of multilateralism and I shall end with it. One of the elements which in the last two years has been added to this phenomenon is the financial crisis which has overtaken our Organization. Following the passing by a consensus last year of resolution 41/213  on the basis of the report of the Group of 18  a process of administrative and financial reform of the United Nations has been started. It is our wish that the reform currently under way should lead on the one hand to greater rationalization and better use of the means and resources of the Organization and on the other to a strengthening of its work to achieve the purposes of the Charter and meet the needs of the international community in our time.The reform is ultimately a task for all of us and we should all be engaged in it. No country can legitimately withhold its financial contributions  thus failing to meet its obligations under the Charter. We trust  in short  that this year substantial progress will be made in the analysis of the internal situation of the United Nations  that accurate diagnoses will be carried out and that a start will be made on teaching agreement on specific revitalization measures. Only in that way will it be possible to strengthen the role of the Organization as an essential forum for discussion  harmonization and action in international relations  and its character as an irreplaceable multilateral instrument  with which Spain fully Identifies and for the success of which it will spare no effort.Fifty years ago an eminent Spaniard  Mr. Gregorio Marafton  said something which holds good today:""We do not know where men will find their new path and their new faith  or where these will lead  but ... the interpretation of the overarching phenomenon of our time  which is the instinctive sense of panic of our species  suggests that the marvellous discovery which will transform future generations is  quite simply  peace""."
"47",2277,"ETH",42,1987,"﻿Mr  President  it gives me great pleasure to extend to you  on behalf of the Ethiopian delegation and on my own behalf  congratulations on your well-deserved election to preside over the forty-second session of the General Assembly. While expressing our confidence that your diplomatic skill and leadership qualities will enable this session to come to a successful conclusion  I should like to assure you of the full co-operation of the Ethiopian delegation as you discharge your heavy responsibilities I take this opportunity also to convey our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Choudhury  for his skilful leadership of the last session of the General Assembly May I also convey heartfelt gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his indefatigable efforts in managing the affairs of the United Nations during one of the most difficult periods of its history.In the context of today's tense world situation  an immediate halt to the arms race is imperative if humanity is to be assured of peace and progress in the coming century. Though the call for disarmament antedated the creation of the United Nations and reverberated throughout the earlier decades of this century  it was the onset of the nuclear era that made that call a most pressing and urgent issue on the international agenda. The belief that nuclear weapons provide security  though still embraced by a few  is rapidly becoming out of harmony with the thinking of the international community and is becoming egregiously anachronistic. Indeed  there is now a consensus that the arms race is not only threatening international security  but undermining global development. My delegation therefore believes that measures must be taken to respond quickly to the deeply felt quest of humanity for peace and disarmament. It is heartening to note in this connection that the Soviet Union and the United States recently agreed in principle to effect real disarmament by eliminating intermediate and short-range nuclear weapons.Further measures  such as the renunciation of the first use of nuclear weapons and the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  could surely go a long way in creating mutual confidence among the nuclear Powers and facilitating progress in nuclear disarmament.At this point I must reiterate Ethiopia's conviction that the Soviet Union deserves the tribute of all peace-loving peoples for the numerous courageous initiatives it has taken to rid the world of nuclear arms. The present opportunity for progress towards genuine disarmament should be taken by all concerned  particularly by those attempting to extend the arms race into outer space.The risks involved in the militarization of outer space are so grave that the call for the abandonment of such a policy should be given the highest priority. The militarization of outer space should be viewed not only in terms of the security danger that the resulting acceleration of the arms race represents  but also in terms of the further diversion of resources that could otherwise be employed to improve the desperate social and economic conditions of the dispossessed in both the developed and the developing worlds. In this connection  I welcome the results of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which highlighted the direct link between disarmament and development and which  we should like to hope  has set in motion the process of development through disarmament. We have no doubt that the $1 trillion estimated to be the current global military expenditure per year could be better utilized in realizing one of the major purposes of the United Nations - economic and social development.The deplorable economic and social condition in which much of humanity finds itself should long ago have elicited the genuine concern of those with the means to make a difference. Instead  the grim economic situation characteristic of the developing world as a whole is left to deteriorate even further  to the point that today  in most of those countries  it has reached alarming dimensions.Although in the final analysis each country has the ultimate responsibility for seeking remedies for its own economic troubles  solutions to externally induced problems require international co-operation and multilateral efforts. This is particularly pertinent to the economic difficulties now confronting developing countries.The most striking feature of the developing world today is the lack of resources for development  which is the result of the persistent problems of the decline in commodity prices  protectionism and the extremely heavy debt burden shouldered by most. Stagnation in official development assistance has also compounded the problem. In fact  as is widely recognized  several developing countries have become net exporters of financial resources to the developed world.In the circumstances  the developed world  I submit  has a political and moral responsibility to help developing countries overcome economic predicaments the major causes of which lie beyond their control. The demand that the developing countries need first to put their house in order is obviously not the correct prescription for a malady whose primary source is the external economic environment. Protectionist measures that deny access to markets for products of the developing countries  the sharply falling prices of commodities and the debt problem require multilateral solutions.Regrettably  however  the North-South dialogue within the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and elsewhere that has been going on for many years has proved to be far from satisfactory and  indeed  the dialogue at the recently concluded seventh conference of UNCTAD has once again demonstrated that many countries of the North have yet to show the political will to accept multilateral solutions to the multifaceted problems hindering economic recovery and growth in the South.In this respect  developing countries  while on the one hand making every effort to remind the developed world of its responsibility and self-interest in global development and in the establishment of the new international economic order  need on the other hand to establish and strengthen South-South co-operation on the basis of collective self-reliance· We believe this fact was underlined and the process of co-operation was further advanced by the Ministerial Conference of Non-Aligned Countries on South-South Co-operation  held in Pyongyang last June-The adverse effects of the global economic environment have been especially severe on the economies of the least developed countries. For Africa  where 27 of the 37 least developed countries are found  the international trading and financial environment has become a major impediment to recovery and to the rehabilitation of the agricultural and other economic sectors  hard hit by the recent catastrophic drought. It is to be recalled that at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to the critical economic crisis in Africa  the international community expressed sympathy for Africa's economic plight and pledged assistance to complement the continent's developmental efforts by adopting the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 (resolution S-13/2). Although African countries have since done their level best to implement economic policies falling broadly within the framework of the priority programme adopted by their leaders in July 1985 and the United Nations Programme of Action  the response of the international community towards helping these efforts has proved disappointing.The sharp decline in export earnings suffered by African countries in 1986  which is continuing in 1987  is hardly conducive to recovery. Far from enjoying effective support for their efforts to revive their economies  African countries have in fact been drained of resources. The external indebtedness of Africa is now estimated to be $200 billion and  when compared with the continent's total gross domestic product and its total export earnings  represents an unbearable burden. Indeed  the debt-servicing commitments of Africa have eaten up resources that could otherwise have been used for agricultural rehabilitation and for effective implementation of the Priority Programme. Furthermore  the situation has been aggravated by the fall in real terms in official development assistance. It is no wonder the present predicament of African countries has been aptly described as one characterized by financial drought and famine.African countries are under no illusion that the search for remedies for their economic woes should be left to others. They are indeed determined to bear the burden required to pull themselves out of the excruciating economic crisis that has stifled recovery for so long. However  since some of the major obstacles to recovery are the results of external factors  international co-operation and assistance are indispensable. The international community is therefore called upon to respond favourably to Africa's need for increased financial assistance and to its desire to convene an international conference on Africa's external indebtedness.In any discussion of African problems  one cannot fail to refer to the explosive situation in southern Africa  for the diffusion of which the international community in general and the United Nations in particular bear a special responsibility. Today there are few more serious threats to international peace and security  and few greater challenges to the principles upon which this Organization is based and  indeed  no more blatant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms than that represented by the racist Pretoria regime and the apartheid system it so single-mindedly promotes.The unlawful occupation and continued suppression of the aspirations of the Namibian people by Pretoria in total defiance of the international community continues with impunity. The United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  has been rendered a dead letter  not because it is an unrealistic plan  but because of the intransigence of Pretoria  which is reinforced by support from a few Governments in the West. Any and all attempts to link the independence of Namibia to other unrelated issues is only a subterfuge for postponing the liberation of the Namibian people  and my delegation feels that the United Nations should not allow itself to be defined by Pretoria indefinitely. Resort should therefore be had without delay to enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  in order to bring the racist regime onto the path of international legality and morality. The imposition of comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions is the only peaceful course of action that could expedite the independence of Namibia. Failing this  the suffering people of Namibia would have no alternative but to intensify the legitimate armed struggle under their sole and authentic representative  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Within South Africa itself  the racist regime has continued to deny the black majority of its fundamental human rights and to practice its abhorrent system of apartheid. The world-wide call for comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against Pretoria is awaiting the response of some Western Governments which still embrace racist Pretoria as an ally and even consider it the last bastion on the African continent of the so-called Western civilization. We should be honest enough to say before this august Assembly  and without fear of contradiction  that the litmus test for one's commitment to human rights is one's attitude towards apartheid. Verbal condemnation of apartheid  which in practice impedes the application of measures to combat this crime against humanity  cannot hoodwink world public opinion and must be abandoned.Ethiopia  true to its commitment to the total liberation of Africa  joins the call for comprehensive mandatory sanctions against Pretoria and expresses its solidarity with the African National Congress and with all patriotic forces engaged in a heroic struggle against the racist regime to regain their freedom and human dignity.It is a widely acknowledged fact that the regime in South Africa has also continued with impunity its destabilization of  and aggression against  the front-line States. The wanton destruction of property and other economic and social infrastructure  as well as the indiscriminate massacre of civilians  including the young and the aged  are daily occurrences throughout southern Africa. Through direct military incursions into neighbouring countries and through the arming and financing of bandits  Pretoria is still attempting to stifle the struggle for liberation and to suppress even political and moral support for those who are fighting for their fundamental freedoms and national independence. In the circumstances  the international community is duty-bound to assist the front-line States to resist Pretoria's aggression and to enable them to overcome their vulnerability to South Africa's economic pressure. In this respect  the establishment by the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries of the Africa Fund is an example that needs to be emulated. Even with its limited capacity  Ethiopia will not fail to extend support to and stand in solidarity with the front-line States.In addition to the situation in southern Africa  there are numerous other hotbeds of tension that threaten international peace and security. The war between Iran and Iraq  for instance  and the accompanying foreign Intervention in the region could easily escalate into a situation with unforeseen consequences to world peace. As has often been stated  this is a war that should never have been started and should never be allowed to continue. The search to find a just and durable solution must  therefore  continue and must be based on the well-known principles and norms of inter-State relations  taking into account the legitimate interests of both parties to the conflict.As a country not far away from the region  Ethiopia is seriously concerned at the increased presence of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf  The Gulf is  in our opinion  a natural extension of the Indian Ocean  which the international community has declared a zone of peace. The early convening of the repeatedly postponed international conference on the Indian Ocean could  therefore  go a long way in contributing to the climate of peace and security  not only In the region of the Indian Ocean  but more particularly around the Persian Gulf. As a hinterland state of the Indian Ocean  Ethiopia attaches great importance to the speedy realization of the objectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace and will continue to strive for the early convening of the conference at Colombo. In the mean time  we call on all those concerned not to aggravate the situation in the region through military and naval build-up and so-called military exercises.As regards the situation in the Middle East  Ethiopia once again insists that the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination is an issue that should be addressed in any peace formula designed to bring about genuine peace to the region  A lasting peace can only be established when the national tights to the Palestinian people are restored and when the rights of all States of the region to live in peace within recognized boundaries are respected. My delegation also believes that progress towards peace in the region requires the holding of an international peace conference with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization.The United Nations has been seized of the questions of Cyprus  Korea  Lebanon  Western Sahara and the situations in south-west and South-East Asia for quite some time. While my Government's views on all these issues are well known  I wish to state that recent developments for peace and national reconciliation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea must be supported and encouraged by the international community. Efforts to restore the unity and territorial integrity of both Cyprus and Lebanon and to advance the process of the peaceful reunification of the Korean people must be intensified. The Ethiopian delegation believes that the recent proposals presented by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea could serve as a constructive basis for accelerating the process of peaceful reunification of the Korean people. As regards the question of Western Sahara  we maintain that implementation of the latest decisions of the Organization of African Unity (OAÜ) and of the General Assembly of the United Nations is more urgent now than ever.When we turn our attention to the situation in Central America  we note with indignation that  in clear contravention of the fundamental principles of respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States  the United States has  during the last nine years  subjected Nicaragua to all sorts of pressure  intimidation and even overt acts of aggression. The intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua directly and through the use of counter-revolutionary bandits masquerading as ""freedom fighters""  is of course a folly beyond our comprehension. If big States  relying on their military might  are allowed to arrogate to themselves the right to decide on the future of other nations  the world would surely be plunged into anarchy. In this day and age we cannot and must not allow the resurgence of imperialism as the dominant factor in world politics. On the contrary  we must uphold international legality and  in this case  we must all echo the call for full and immediate compliance with the Judgment of the International Court of Justice of 27 June 1986. While expressing solidarity with the Nicaraguan people and Government  Ethiopia wishes to commend the efforts of the Contadora and Support Groups  as well as the recent efforts of the countries of Central America collectively to shoulder the responsibility for bringing about peace in their region.It will be recalled that at its forty-first session the General Assembly  responding to a widely felt need for introducing reforms to improve the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations  adopted resolution 41/213. Although no one with genuine concern for the health of the Organization could belittle the importance of the reforms adopted  we cannot hide our disappointment at the fact that some were tempted to use the reform exercise to attack multilateralism in general and to undermine the authority of the General Assembly in particular.Furthermore  we should like to state quite openly and with candour that the avowal by the United States of its commitment to reform of the administrative and financial functioning of the Organization while it refuses to pay its assessed contributions to the regular budget of the United Nations cannot but sound hollow. We are  at any rate  gratified to note that  despite the immense political pressure and financial difficulties it has faced in the past few years  the world body is still striving to overcome its difficulties and fulfil the purposes entrusted to it.Before I conclude my statement  I beg the indulgence of the Assembly to say a few words about the proclamation of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in September this year - a historic development which we believe will further enhance Ethiopia's international standing and promote regional peace.The Provisional Military Administrative Council  despite all the efforts to besmirch its image  belittle its achievements and even question its revolutionary and patriotic essence  has today vindicated itself by fulfilling its original promise to hand over power to a genuinely representative Government that responds to the aspirations of the Ethiopian people to equality  social justice and progress.The past 13 years in Ethiopia's history have been years of fundamental changes which not only freed the Ethiopian people from centuries of bondage and servitude but also registered encouraging achievements in the various fields of national endeavour  thus setting the stage for the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.The Constitution of the new Republic  which is the supreme law of the land  has been drafted by experts from all relevant disciplines and is firmly based on the historical  cultural  political and economic conditions of the country. The draft of the Constitution was discussed  enriched and amended by the people nation-wide and came into force only after it was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the Ethiopian people in a national referendum. The National Assembly - or National Shengo - composed of well over 800 deputies  was also formed through a process of democratic elections and in today's Ethiopia constitutes the highest organ of State power.The first session of the National Shengo  concluded only recently  has issued important proclamations among which figure the historic changes made in the regional administrative structure of the country and in the devolution of power to the regions so as to guarantee the equality of nationalities and facilitate their speedy development. The country is now reorganized into five autonomous and 24 administrative regions. This structure  we believe  will ensure the free exercise by our people of their political  economic and cultural rights  while at the same time safeguarding and consolidating the historical unity of the motherland.Though the establishment of the Republic represents a milestone in our history and has laid a solid foundation for overall development  we are well aware of the fact that long years of hard work and sacrifice are yet required for accelerated social and economic progress. Like other developing countries  Ethiopia suffers from the prevailing unjust international economic system and is still a victim of natural calamities. More particularly  it is now once again exposed to the challenges of the drought which has resulted from the small amount and uneven distribution of precipitation during the main rainy season this year.As a result we are expecting next year a drastic shortfall in food production in the affected regions. Regrettably  some Governments are already attempting to use our predicaments to promote their own ideology and policy prescriptions by attributing this shortfall to the agricultural policies we have chosen for ourselves. The zealous effort of some  particularly officials of the United States Administration  to promote this point of view is such that this appears to be tantamount  to linking natural calamities  from which they themselves are not immune  to the policies we have chosen to pursue. Undeterred by the self-serving pronouncements and actions of others  we will  however  continue to give special emphasis and priority attention to agricultural development and food production.While the current drought will undoubtedly impede our determined efforts to rehabilitate and develop the agricultural sector of our economy  we have no doubt that with the effective mobilization of our own limited resources and the assistance of the international community we shall be able to overcome this temporary setback so that the aspirations of our people to a better and brighter tomorrow may be realized.As regards the foreign policy of the People's Democratic Republic  chapter 5 of the new Constitution sets out the basic guidelines. According to article 29: ""The People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia shall strive for co-operation among peoples  mutual development and the strengthening of good-neighbourly relations with adjoining States on the basis of respect for the inviolability of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  non-interference in their internal affairs  the peaceful resolution of conflicts and  in general  the principles of non-alignment.""On the basis of mutual acceptance of these principles  we are ready to forge and strengthen relations with all countries  particularly those which are in our region and with which we have had difficult relations.We do not interfere in the internal affairs of others and we expect others to act similarly. We respect the national unity and territorial integrity of other States  and we expect others to respect ours. The establishment of the Republic  with its new regional structures  and the peace process that we have initiated have created  we believe  the necessary favourable atmosphere and conditions for the countries of the region to address the substantive issues that divide them and to establish a long-lasting peace on the basis of mutual respect for the principles and norms of international law and good-neighbourly relations.Finally  I should like to reiterate our conviction that in the present interdependent world there is no substitute for multilateralism as the best mechanism for solving the various complex international problems confronting humanity. Indeed  we should all be seriously concerned at the various manifestations of hostility to these principles evident in recent years  and as a result must exert every effort to combat such manifestations. We must above all support and strengthen the United Nations as the universal embodiment of multilateralism.The People's Democratic Republic  whose Constitution explicitly prescribes for Ethiopia active participation in international and regional organizations  affirms its full support for the United Nations and a strong commitment to its Charter principles.

"48",2323,"FIN",42,1987,"﻿I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. I am convinced that your experience and diplomatic skill will help you lead this session to a successful conclusion. I am also pleased to note that you represent a country with which Finland enjoys good and constructive co-operation.I wish to express the appreciation of the Finnish Government to your predecessor in the presidency. His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  for the most valuable work he did in presiding over the General Assembly at its forty-first session. The Finnish Government supports the determined efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuéllar  for the benefit of our Organization. In the midst of its difficulties  the Organization has demonstrated the ability to resist the erosion of its authority. But that is not enough; the trend must be reversed. The General Assembly now has a particular responsibility to adopt decisions that will make it possible again for the United Nations to play the unique role its founding fathers had in mind when they drafted the Charter over 40 years ago. In that work  the annual report of the Secretary-General is a welcome harbinger of renewed faith. We all agree that awesome challenges In the areas of security and disarmament and economic and social development as well as human rights call for action. In practice  however  agreement on strategies and concrete measures often remains beyond our reach. Perceiving the national interest in an antagonistic manner is contradictory to collective security. For more than four decades the United Nations has stood at the centre of efforts to accommodate both the legitimate interests of sovereign nations and the requirements of collective security.Finally  after years of fear and frustration  a positive change appears to be on the way in big-Power relations. The recent agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union on crisis control  on nuclear-arms reduction and on a summit meeting seem to open a window of opportunity that should be fully utilized. A process leading to a diminished role for nuclear as well as conventional weapons in the maintenance of peace and security is indeed evolving. The momentum should not be neglected. The emerging agreement on intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) is historic because it actually reduces existing nuclear arsenals. Its impact is felt especially in Europe  here progress is needed in the reduction of both nuclear armaments and conventional forces.It is natural for Finland warmly to welcome the intensification of the international dialogue. Pursuing a policy of neutrality  my country does not seek security in military alliances. We emphasize the value of collective action through organized international co-operation. We believe in the United Nations. Nor is it redundant  today  to renew our commitment to the United Nations  to its Charter  its principles and its goals.All nations  big and small  nuclear and non-nuclear alike  share a legitimate interest in and an inescapable responsibility for international peace and security. Here again  this Organization is at the focus of a common endeavour. The Conference on Disarmament  with its broad agenda  offers ample possibility Les for multilateral negotiations on the prevention of the arms race as well as : an extension to new areas.In order to make its own contribution to the multilateral disarmament  Finland has recently advanced ideas on two areas which also offer opportunities for the United Nations. One area is verification of disarmament agreements; confidence-building is the other.On regional disarmament  Finland speaks against developments that in cui view might upset regional stability in Europe. We emphasize that all military Powers should show responsibility and restraint in the northern parts of Europe. Our well-known initiatives regarding the establishment of a Nordic nuclear-weapon free zone and the benefits of added trust and confidence in the maritime areas in the North relate to that concern. We hope that the favourable developments in Central Europe will not adversely affect the stability on the flanks of Europe.The Stockholm Conference  held within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  adopted last year a significant s t of confidence-building measures. The adoption of those measures marks a step towards greater openness in military matters. We expect more steps to follow as the Conference resumes its work.Delegations of 35 states are at present convened in Vienna for the third follow-up meeting of the CSCE. Finland expects concrete results both in the implementation of already agreed provisions and in the form of further commitments. The central dimensions of the CSCE - security and confidence-building  economic co-operation and human contacts - all need to be strengthened. The CSCE process has great potential. This process is not directed against anyone but works for the good of all  both in Europe and elsewhere. The way by which South Africa is governed represents precisely what the United Nations was designed to oppose: insecurity  injustice and discrimination. The United Nations must intensify its efforts designed to bring about the eradication of the inhuman and immoral system of apartheid. Apartheid cannot be reformed: it must be abolished.We have demonstrated our preparedness to carry out concrete measures against apartheid. The Finnish Parliament has enacted a law which forbids all trade between Finland and South Africa. The law entered into force on 1 July this year.The Finnish Government continues to believe that mandatory international sanctions in accordance with Chapter Vii of the United Nations Charter should be imposed on South Africa. Such concerted efforts would pressure South Africa into real change. Together with the other Nordic countries  we continue to work towards that end. A decision on sanctions must be coupled with increased assistance to the front-line States and to the countries of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). At present a substantial part of Finnish bilateral development assistance is already going to those States.The South African Government also bears full responsibility for the situation in Namibia. The Government of Finland rejects the linkage of the application of resolution 435 (1978) with extraneous matters. We have repeatedly condemned all of South Africa's unilateral actions and dilatory tactics.The situation in the Middle East remains of serious concern to the world community. A just  lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute can be achieved only through negotiations on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. An international conference could make a major contribution towards that end. Intensive efforts are needed to bring about an agreement on the principles and the mandate of such a conference. I am pleased to see that efforts towards such a conference continue. The war between Iran and Iraq has continued for seven years. Under the leadership of this Organization the international community has intensified its efforts to end this immensely destructive war. The latest reports from the area underline the urgent need to search for the means of terminating the conflict  which  if it continues  may have the potential for detrimental world-wide repercussions.Central America suffers from violence and social instability. After years of effort  all five Governments of the region have now agreed on a plan  including a cease-fire and social reconciliation in the spirit of democracy. Finland believes in regional solutions to regional problems. We welcome the process that the Guatemala agreement represents and are prepared to make our appropriate contribution to its support.Where conflicts beset nations the United Nations must be ready to render its services for the restoration of peace. The development of United Nations peace-keeping has been one of the most successful achievements of this Organization  Finland is particularly honoured by its involvement in these operations for over 30 years.Peace-keeping operations should be carried out under a clear mandate from the Security Council  with the full support of its members and on the basis of satisfactory financial arrangements. A clear demonstration by all Member States of their willingness to give full political support to the United Nations peace-keeping efforts and to pay their assessed contributions remains indispensable.The United Nations has agreed on an impressive body of internationally recognized human rights standards. Yet we are daily witnessing violations of human rights in many parts of the world. Perhaps in no area of United Nations activities is the gap between promise and performance more evident than in that of human rights. It is our common responsibility to ensure respect for them.The vulnerable situation of the millions of refugees and displaced persons in different parts of the world calls for action by the international community and by individual countries. Those in need of international protection and assistance must be helped. In this work we rely fully on the goals and objectives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It is our policy to increase out contribution to assist in the alleviation of the world refugee situation.The problems of the world economy are a matter of serious concern. Despite progress in strengthening the prerequisites for global growth  economic development in the industrial countries is slower than anticipated. In the developing countries depressed levels of export earnings  high real interest rates  ever-mounting debt service payments and shrinking inflows of financial resources harass economic performance and weaken development prospects.The avoidance of another recession and the restoration of sustained growth require determined and urgent policy changes in both developed and developing countries. The social costs of the necessary adjustment policies in developing countries ought to be recognized by the international community. We welcome the recent increase in the activities of international financial institutions designed to alleviate their worst effects.The debt problem continues to be an impediment to growth in the developing world  it is a major reason for the further deterioration of the living conditions of the poorest of the poor. The heavy debt burden complicates the readjustment of the economic policies of these countries. Structural adjustment programmes and other efforts to improve domestic resource mobilization  including a more efficient use of investments  are not bringing about instant results because of the debt servicing payments. The problem of debt servicing by the developing countries should be further studied in the global context. When channelling the increased capital assistance  the needs of the most vulnerable countries should be properly addressed.Against this background  Finland welcomes the positive outcome of the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Its final act must be translated into concrete actions at the national level and in the appropriate organizations.The economic and social situation in Africa will be reviewed at this session of the General Assembly for the first time since the adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action for Africa in May 1986. Finland considers it important for the international community to show determination in the implementation of the Programme. Finland  for its part  has carefully studied its possibilities of promoting the Programme. At the multilateral level  Finland has constantly emphasized the urgency of a more effective response by international organizations and financial Institutions to African economic and social needs. Some 60 per cent of our bilateral aid is now directed to Africa.Over-exploitation of natural resources and the consequent deterioration of the environment have altered globally important life-support systems  and the basis for our economic and social development is severely undermined. The threat to our environment has put our very survival at stake. These issues stand out clearly as a major concern on the International political agenda.The World Commission on Environment and Development  led by Mr. Gro Harlem Brundtland  Prime Minister of Norway  has analysed these issues in a profound manner. Both the World Commission report and the environmental perspective prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) convey the same message to us: that economic growth and more equitable development are not only necessary but also possible without endangering the natural resource basis. The Government of Finland endorses the recommendations in the environment perspective and the principles In the World Commission report. Sustainable development should be one of the guiding principles in the activities of the United Nations system and of other international organizations.It was Important that last year's extensive debate on the efficiency of the United Nations resulted in a consensus. All organizations should  in fact  periodically submit their activities to close scrutiny. Rather than a singular event  this should be seen as a continuous process  in which viability in substance and efficiency in administration constitute an entity.The United Nations is no exception. A thorough self-analysis should involve a discussion on such modifications as may be deemed necessary. Decisions should follow. The entire process should focus on the strengthening of the operative capabilities of the Organization in the opinion of my Government  the United Nations as an Organization should strive for maximum effectiveness  based on a stable and reliable financial basis. The former cannot be achieved without the latter. A sound financial basis cannot be established unless all Member States demonstrate their willingness to meet their financial obligations. Assessed contributions to the United Nations budget cannot be made conditional on national requirements regarding the Organization's performance.The United Nations is our common mechanism in our striving for common goals. Administrative effectiveness is a necessary  but not an adequate  condition for achieving those goals. Adequate conditions are created only by the willingness of the Member States to make full use of this mechanism.Let us make good the commitments and promises we  the Member States  made to this Organization at its commemorative session two years ago. Let us be frank enough to recognize its failures and weaknesses  as well as its strengths. Let us not lose sight of the chances to redress what has been neglected. Let us use our resources wisely for the purposes for which the United Nations was created. In a changing world this Organization must be responsive to the changing needs of mankind  whether they arise from the need for security  economic and social development  or human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"49",2367,"FJI",42,1987,"﻿My delegation warmly congratulates you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Our thanks and compliments go to your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  for his outstanding leadership of the forty-first session.The international community is aware of the recent political and constitutional developments which have led to the change of Government in Fiji. The situation is an Internal matter which the people of Fiji must be allowed to resolve in their own way. Interference of any kind from outside will not help in resolving our domestic difficulties  and we urge all Member States to show understanding of our situation.Looking back at the international scene over this past year  my Government has been greatly encouraged by the many instances of positive developments  which indicate that  in spite of serious differences  conflicting countries can come to terms with each other. The recent conclusion of the important peace accord between five Central American countries is a case in point. The many trouble-spots which remain must be tackled in the same spirit if they are to disappear from our agenda.Sadly  the Middle East remains an area of violent turbulence and a source of potential international instability. The Iran-Iraq war is a tragic reminder of the futility of the use of force. The recent initiatives  especially by the Security Council and by the personal involvement of the Secretary-General  to bring an end to that conflict are a welcome development  and we pray for their success. My Government remains committed to the principle of the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and the right of all States  including Israel  to safe and secure boundaries. As an indication of our willingness to contribute in whatever way we can to the peace process in this region# we have continued to maintain troops within the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as well as in Sinai. However# our participation in the United Nations peace-keeping forces in Lebanon has cost us dearly. Twenty-two of our soldiers have lost their lives in that distant land while our country has been burdened with an escalating debt of over $20 million. This is a very heavy and unfair burden on a small country like Fiji. We urge those States which have withheld their contributions in the past to pay up their arrears and those States still currently withholding them to meet their obligations. We are particularly distressed that the United States# one of the main promoters of UNIFIL# is now the major withholder.Nothing new can be said to describe the appalling situation in South Africa. There are# however# hopeful signs that some moderate elements within South Africa are attempting to find an honourable way forward# but their voices are still too feeble and need support from outside. The international community must continue to exert all pressure on South Africa to abandon apartheid. South Africa1s stranglehold over Namibia# and its refusal to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in continuing defiance of the rest of the world  is a sorry indictment of the impotence of the international community when only a few countries keep supporting that regime.Once more# this General Assembly will review the situation in Kampuchea# Afghanistan and Cyprus. The people of those countries have gone through another year of oppression# violence and intimidation but their spirits remain high# hopeful that justice must soon come their way. We again urge the withdrawal of all foreign forces and a return to respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of those countries. While wars are raging in several parts of the world  new ones must be prevented from erupting elsewhere. For that reason it is a matter of urgency that preventive measures be adopted to defuse tensions in areas like the Korean peninsula. We urge the Governments of both South and North Korea to resume dialogue with a view to resolving their differences by negotiation in order to achieve a peaceful reunification. Pending a just and durable settlement  we support the call for admission of both Koreas to the United Nations and meanwhile urge them to coexist peacefully.The recent peace accord in Central America is a bold initiative by the countries concerned. They should be given every support to help the accord to work. We were pleased to be part of the consensus resolution adopted in this Assembly two days ago.Underlying much of the instability in the world is the unequal distribution of wealth and opportunity. The heavy load of foreign debt now borne by developing countries is being aggravated by the protectionist policies which appear increasingly to be the trend in industrialized countries. The situation has worsened over the past few years  yet those countries with the power and the resources to change the basis of the disparity  refuse or are reluctant to take effective action. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  which was launched with so much optimism recently  seems also to have collided with the unwillingness of some developed countries to open their markets. A way must be found to remove the frustration and vicious circle of poverty and depression from the majority of the world's peoples.The final traces of colonialism are still to be laid to rest in many corners of the world. In our region  while the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands has moved towards self-determination  the same cannot be said for New Caledonia. That neighbour of ours in the South Pacific has just gone through a referendum which was boycotted by most of the Kanak people. In spite of the advice and pleadings to abandon the referendum and establish dialogue with the representatives of the indigenous people so that they too can be part of the political process  France insisted on carrying on. It is sad to see deeper bitterness and racial polarization developing. Our assessment is that a volatile situation exists in this close neighbour and we trust and pray that the principal parties involved will exercise good sense and restraint and work towards finding an acceptable solution to their problems. We trust that the wishes of the indigenous people will remain of priority concern to the French Government.The steady progress being made by other Territories still classified as Non-Self-Governing  under the careful surveillance of the decolonization Committee  is encouraging. Many of these Territories ate in the Pacific. Although it should not need repeating  the people of the Territories concerned must be the ones to decide their future form of government? this should not be chosen for them  nor forced upon them  by over-zealous decolonizers.Since the forty-first session of the General Assembly  the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty has come into effect. This has extended the nuclear-free zone beyond the area covered by the earlier Treaties of Tlatelolco and Antarctica and the three together cover nearly one third of the entire earth's surface. We are happy to note that of the nuclear Powers  both the Soviet Union and China have signed the relevant Protocols. Naturally  we are disappointed that the United States  the United Kingdom and France have not seen fit to do so.We renew our plea to the Government of France to discontinue its nuclear testing at Mururoa. We urge France  which is a major Power as well as a permanent member of the Security Council  to heed the concern of the Pacific countries and thereby remove one of the main obstacles to the further promotion and enhancing of the friendly ties and co-operation existing between France and the Pacific countries.The work and recommendations of the Group of 18 has had a salutary effect on the cost and effectiveness of the United Nations bureaucracy. The Secretary-General must be commended for the seriousness and single-mindedness with which he has instituted streamlining and effected economies in administrative structures. Clearly  over the past year what we have seen emerge is a much leaner and  we hope  healthier Secretariat. Yet the tasks before it are certainly no less difficult and complex  so the challenges facing them are daunting. My delegation pays a tribute to the Secretary-General and all his staff for the extraordinary efforts they have made in the service of mankind. This past year has seen enormous pressures falling upon the Secretary-General and his top aides and we congratulate them on their vigour and energy and on their abiding commitment to the ideals of the united family of nations."
"50",2414,"FRA",42,1987,"﻿It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly. Mr. President  I am pleased to extend to you France's congratulations on your election  which is testimony to the confidence all delegations have in you. We are convinced that under your presidency the work of the Assembly will be pursued with authority and efficiency. I wish you every success and assure you of our full co-operation.In the time that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly the international situation has been marked by three principal characteristics.First  there has been a disturbing lack of progress in resolving regional conflicts. Not only has none been resolved - either the situation is still blocked  as in southern Africa and Cambodia  or progress that had been announced  as in Afghanistan  or broached in outline  as in the Middle East with the proposal for a conference  has failed to be translated into action - but  even worse  in some instances the situation has deteriorated. That is the case with the conflict between Iraq and Iran  which  beyond the serious confrontations it periodically produces  threatens to spread to the whole of a strategic region whose equilibrium is Important for the entire world. The second characteristic is the persistence of major economic and financial problems. In this respect too the period has not produced much to give rise to much satisfaction. The issue of indebtedness  despite some adjustments that have been introduced  continues to compromise the situation in a good many third-world States. Instability in the prices of many raw materials has continued to disrupt both International trade and  even more serious  the courageous efforts of countries whose fate is closely linked to the prices of those products. In these conditions  the development of those States continues to be handicapped  with demographic pressures still a factor even as the legitimate aspirations of the populations concerned grow. The third characteristic that currently has centre place in international attention is the opening in American-Soviet relations. Along with the concerns and disappointments that I have just mentioned  1987 will probably be marked as the year in which East-West relations were given renewed impetus. Each of us is naturally aware of the prospects that have been opened up  both in respect of an agreement on dismantling American and Soviet medium-range missiles  which new appears close  and in developing contacts among the peoples of Europe's divided continent  as witnessed - and you  Mr. President  are more aware of this than anyone - by Mr. Honecker's visit to the Federal Republic of Germany. In this same context is the work of the third meeting of the follow-up Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which will be able  we hope  to complete its work in Vienna between now and December with balanced results  including gains in the area of human rights and contacts among individuals.However positive  the improvement in relations between Washington and Moscow remains for the time being confined within precise limits: United States-Soviet talks on disarmament have yet to focus on reducing the huge strategic arsenals of the Soviet union and the United States  They have centred above all on Europe.Given the world situation as it now stands  three important questions have to be asked; How far can United States-Soviet talks go towards improving the climate between East and West? Can the change in East-West relations affect regional crises? Will we be more capable of grappling with ways to resolve the economic and financial problems confronting the world?France believes that the international community must meet these three challenges: by encouraging progress but also by reaffirming the conditions for genuine detente between East and West) by bringing about conditions conducive to the search for solutions to regional crises by the countries concerned by bringing imagination and courage into play to devise new ways to help resolve the problems of indebtedness and development.A world of greater stability and interdependence must also be a safer world. France is well aware of the stakes  such as the ramifications of the present normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. We hope that this will not result in decreased security for other countries  especially in Europe. France has followed very attentively the preparation of the treaty to eliminate American and Soviet intermediate-range missiles. It has welcomed  as was fitting  the decisions by the Soviet Union to remove the obstacles that country had placed on the road to an agreement  whether concerning the link between the various aspects of the bilateral negotiations in Geneva  the claim to take into account British and French independent nuclear forces  or the request to maintain a number of SS-20s facing Asia.Nevertheless  we must continue to keep our vision clear. More disarmament does not automatically mean greater security. We cannot  in particular  disregard the threats to Europe that come from the substantial imbalance in conventional and chemical weapons.This is why as early as 1978 France took the initiative for a conference on disarmament in Europe and welcomes the gains made a year ago in Stockholm. Together with its partners in the Atlantic Alliance and in the context of the multilateral process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  it will spare no effort to enable the second phase of the Conference  which  we hope  will begin in 198-8  to advance towards greater stability in conventional arms on our continent. For this reason also  we attach the utmost importance to the Geneva negotiations to ban completely the manufacture of chemical weapons in the world and to destroy existing stockpiles. But until there is progress towards the destruction of those stockpiles known to be the largest  it is advisable to maintain the option of a minimum stock for security. Western Europe cannot be disarmed in the area of chemical weapons 10 years before the Soviet Union itself completes the verified destruction of its stockpiles.With the proposed elimination of medium-range nuclear forces we should not lose sight of the fact that Europe will continue to be subject  without limitation at this stage  to the threat of a far more considerable number of intercontinental systems  which are also capable of reaching targets on our side of the Atlantic. France  therefore  hopes that the United States and the Soviet Union  without neglecting those aspects related to defensive systems and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty  will at long last return to the teal priority of arms control  namely  the strategic systems of the two countries.In this spirit  France welcomed the goal of a 50 per cent reduction in Soviet and American strategic arsenals that was set at Reykjavik last year. Admittedly  halving these arsenals merely brings the Americans and Soviets back to the level prevailing at the end of the preceding decade when SALT II was signed. Nevertheless  this would clearly be a step in the right direction and would establish  as a real priority  not the illusory quest for denuclearization but the gradual and verified reduction of the excessively huge central arsenals. There is virtually no other serious alternative and it seems scarcely reasonable to envision the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within the foreseeable future.France will not decline to participate  when the occasion arises  in multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament. Such talks  however  would be justified only as a later phase of a process of nuclear-arms reduction in which the two super-Powers would already have made very substantial progress. The President of the French Republic  speaking here in September 1983  enumerated the conditions for his country's participation. I would like to repeat those conditions: Soviet and American arsenals must be reduced to a level at which the disparity between their arsenals and those of other nuclear Powers changes in nature  the defensive systems that could destabilize the current bases of deterrence must not be strengthened  the imbalance in conventional weapons must be eliminated  and the elimination of the chemical threat must become a fact.Until such time as these conditions are met  France will not agree to its forces being taken into account  directly or indirectly  in negotiations to which it is not a party. As the Prime Minister  Mr. Jacques Chirac  indicated from this rostrum last years""As long as French security rests on nuclear deterrence  the first requirement for my country is to maintain the credibility of its strategic forces at the necessary level. For that reason  France has naturally declined to go along with any form of planned obsolescence of its forces while other Powers retain a huge excess nuclear capacity. It will accept neither a quantitative nor a qualitative freeze on its arsenals nor will it halt its nuclear tests. That arsenal does not exceed the level considered"" indispensable for our security and our independence. The nuclear tests are being carried out in unquestionably safe conditions ..."" (A/41/PV. 8  p. 71). These have been acknowledged as such by independent experts from Pacific countries whose concerns for the environment we understand and share.In the area of information  France is prepared to take a new step. After welcoming several Heads of State or Government from the region to the test site on Mururoa this year  it now invites the leaders of the Andean countries bordering the Pacific. Other States regularly carry out far more tests than France does  and have been doing so for a longer period. None  we believe  has so far offered such guarantees. The Improved climate of East-West relations has had no effect to date on the principal regional conflicts. Recognizing this fact  the international community must increase its attention and its effort  in particular to bring about conditions favourable to the search for appropriate solutions by the parties directly concerned. Yet we must make a distinction among the different types of crises confronting the world.In some cases  the situation continues to be stalemated. This Is true of southern Africa. With Its sense of community with all of Africa  and especially with countries close to It because of history  language and exceptional human ties  France believes that new impetus can and should be given to the reduction of tensions  the resumption of dialogue and the restoration of peace in southern Africa. Prance has already taken action along these lines  for example regarding the unprecedented exchange of prisoners that recently took place following a French initiative and after the many contacts France had over a period of months with various States in the region. We hope that this exchange will be followed without delay by new developments as envisioned. The official visit to Paris at this time by the President of Angola  and the visit next week by the President of Mozambique  both of whom played a key role in effecting the exchange  will make it possible to assess the prospects that have been opened up.But there can be no return to peace In the region in the absence of dialogue in South Africa itself among all the components of South African society that have together built that country. The release of political prisoners and the renunciation of violence and of preconditions are the prerequisites for this necessary dialogue. Its purpose can be none other than the dismantling of apartheid. The French Government whole-heartedly condemns the system of apartheid  which is intolerable. It has consistently supported  particularly within the European Community  he Implementation of restrictive measures designed to make the South African Government begin such a dialogue.Somewhat different Is the conflict in Western Sahara; although no visible progress has been observed. It does perhaps offer more promising prospects for a solution  given the mediation attempts under way. The combined efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the President of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and friendly Arab leaders should at last lead to a settlement within the framework of the right to self-determination of the populations concerned. No country would welcome more whole-heartedly than France a solution that brings closer together the countries of North Africa with which it maintains truly privileged relations.At the other end of the Sahara  the conflict between Chad and Libya has gone through a dramatic change over the past few months  but the final outcome has yet to be determined. Combining determination  courage and audacity  the Chadian army succeeded  under the authority of President Hissein Habre  in liberating from foreign occupation almost all the provinces in the north. There remains the dispute over the Aouzou Strip. Clearly  this dispute  with which the OAU and its ad hoc committee have been seized  will find a lasting solution in the present context only when it has been settled according to law. France  which brought Chad to independence and thus bequeathed to it its borders  considers this territory to belong to Chad. It is ready once again to communicate the documents in its possession to bodies that so request. For the rest  true to its commitments Prance will keep the purely defensive and deterrent military arrangements it now has there for as long as it believes necessary.In Cambodia  despite the efforts of the ASEAN countries  the situation remains deadlocked. Nothing  however  warrants the foreign occupation which  by its continuation  has increasingly assumed overtones of colonization. Viet Nam should  understand the deadlock in which it now finds itself. It must try to find  together with its neighbours and with help from all  particularly Prince Sihanouk  whom Prance is pleased to be welcoming again  the paths towards a political solution. For the people of Prance  who are linked to the Khmer people by an old and ever-present friendship  such a solution can only be the restoration of a Cambodia that is free from all foreign occupation and free to determine its destiny.There are other situations in which stated intentions have unfortunately not been translated into concrete actions. It is therefore incumbent on the international community to redouble its efforts and its firmness.Covering Afghanistan  certain Soviet statements led to the assumption that the new team of leaders in Moscow had perhaps understood that the invasion  followed by the occupation  of this independent non-aligned country  which was not at all hostile to the Soviet Union  was a grave mistake. It is a fact that eight years of fiercely waged war have not shaken the determined resistance of a courageous people. Their unyielding determination  the sweeping condemnation of the aggressor by the international community and the resolute support for the cause of Afghanistan  and also for Pakistan  which has generously welcomed on its soil 3 million refugees forced into exile  should convince the Soviet Union that it cannot rely on time to impose a solution by force. While the conditions for a settlement have already been largely defined  thanks to the efforts of the Secretary-General and his special envoy  Mr. Cordovez  the fact remains that the Geneva talks on a timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet troops have still not achieved their objective. If the Soviet leaders sincerely wish to embark upon the path to a negotiated solution  they should act accordingly and  in order to end promptly this conflict of another age  fully accept the right of the Afghan people freely to determine its future. That is what France and almost all the countries represented here expect of them. To a considerable extent the evolution of the international climate will depend on this.In the Middle East  after years of deadlock  the Israeli-Arab conflict recently showed renewed and hopeful signs of progress towards a comprehensive settlement in the revised framework of an international conference which would bring together the parties to the conflict and the permanent members of the Security Council. Since the beginning. Prance has been favourable to such a project  in which it hopes to take an active part. To our mind  such a conference should serve for reflection and advice  without imposing itself on or taking the part of the parties themselves. It should serve to sanction and enrich the dialogue which  thanks to the bold initiatives of certain Arab and Israeli leaders  has begun to take hold. The movement towards peace  unfortunately  appears to be at a standstill at this time. It is essential for its momentum to be restored  naturally on the initiative of the parties directly concerned  but also with the encouragement of the international community as a whole  and particularly States that have special responsibilities and therefore special duties. After 40 years of confrontation  it is more than time to ensure Israel's right to live in peace within secure and recognized borders  and that of the Palestinian people to choose its future by means of self-determination  with all that that implies.At the centre of this conflict  against its wishes  Lebanon  a torn and ravaged country  is paying an ever heavier tribute to the crises of the region on which it has no influence. To the tragedy of war are now added the effects of an unprecedented economic crisis. Prance has decided to continue its presence in Lebanon in spite of the risks and dangers. It continues to be a part of the United Nations Force which  despite its shortcomings  embodies the commitment of the international community to Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The entire world should now mobilize and make an exceptional effort on behalf of all the populations of Lebanon without exception. France  for its part  has Increased its aid again this year. It calls on everyone to contribute to the special fund set up by the recent summit of French-speaking countries. Lebanon  however  will find peace only in the reconciliation of the Lebanese themselves and the establishment of normal relations with the countries of the region. This is the position which we have consistently conveyed to each of Lebanon's leaders and each of the neighbouring States.Lastly  one crisis  far from abating  seems likely to spread to an entire region. The devastating war between Iraq and Iran has been going on for seven years. In terms of the number of victims and ferocity of the fighting  this war must already be counted among the deadliest of this century. Forms of warfare have been resorted to that are particularly to be condemned  such as the use of chemical weapons and sending to the front children who are barely in their adolescence  today the fighting directly threatens other countries and seriously impinges on the principles of the freedom and safety of navigation endorsed by the international community. France  along with the majority of States represented here  calls for an end to a conflict that can be dealt with only in its entirety. Over and above the cruel suffering of the two peoples  France is particularly sensitive to the concerns of riparian States of the Gulf and intends to demonstrate in concrete terms its commitment to freedom of navigation. Some of our ships are present in the region where they are ensuring the protection of our interests. But we are deliberately maintaining this action within specific limits and have declined to participate in any multinational actions that could give the situation the overtones of an East-West confrontation.With a tenacity to which I should like to pay a tribute  the Secretary-General nine months ago called on the Security Council to try new efforts. After close consultations among the five permanent members of the Council and a constructive debate among all the members  these efforts led  on 20 July  at a meeting at which I had the honour of presiding  to the unanimous adoption of resolution 598 (1987). This balanced resolution should be implemented in its entirety  starting with the decision on the cease-fire it imposes.Two months have since elapsed. The Secretary-General has been to Tehran and Baghdad. It appears that one of the two belligerents has confirmed its acceptance of the resolution in its entirety while the other seeks to impose its own reading of the text and its own conditions. The authority of the Security Council  which has acted under Chapter VII of the Charter  and the authority of our Organization as a whole are at stake. Great firmness is called for because  as our Prime Minister  Mr. Jacques Chirac  emphasized a year ago from this rostrum the stubborn pursuit of this absurd war  beyond the suffering it imposes on the two peoples  threatens to shatter the equilibrium of a region of strategic importance for the whole world. Other regional crises in addition to those I have just mentioned remain unresolved and continue to retain our full attention. In Cyprus  a de facto situation  which France does not recognize  persists despite the efforts of the Secretary-General  who is in the best position to help bring forth a solution. In the Korean peninsula  where a remarkable process of democratization is under way in the south  we hope that direct contacts between Seoul and Pyong Yang will be resumed at an early date and that the Korean people as a whole will at last he represented in our Organization.I should like finally to mention the situation in Central America  of which Costa Rica's President has just underlined the hopeful aspects. After more than four years of persevering effort at the initiative of the Contadora Group  the Presidents of the five countries of the isthmus have reached an overall agreement. Admittedly  no one supposes that the road ahead is without obstacles.Nevertheless  an important step forward was made with the summit in Guatemala. The Central American countries themselves have demonstrated their determination to break the cycle of confrontation and settle their disputes themselves. The hopes occasioned by that meeting should be sustained. The commitments made should  by involving all the interested parties  make it possible to extend democracy to the whole region and lay the foundations for a lasting peace.It is obvious that the improvement in East-West relations does not  of itself  imply a solution to regional crises. Solutions can result only from the efforts of the countries directly concerned and action by the international community to bring about conditions conducive to the success of those efforts  Europeans  who in the past have been torn by fratricidal wars and are today resolutely committed to building a common future  know this well. France  for its part  is ready to contribute to any regional attempt to settle conflicts and to act in a way that may allow Europe to contribute.  The serious economic and financial problems besetting the international community reveal the extent to which all too often selfish  short-term responses still prevail over awareness of the necessary Interdependence and shared interests. In this respect the European experiment is showing the way.The European Community is growing stronger. Its enlargement in January 1986 to include Spain and Portugal has enhanced the Mediterranean dimension of the Community. The Single European Act  in effect since July 1987  has opened up new areas for action  while setting for the Community a key objective; the completion in 1992 of a huge internal market. Since its establishment nine years ago the European monetary system has become a pole of stability in an international monetary system in crisis. Technological Europe  lastly  has distinguished itself by achievements that at times go beyond the Twelve  as in the case of Ariane and Eureka.Encompassing 320 million Europeans and open to the world  the Community is determined to acquire both a political and a security dimension enabling Europe to regain its rightful place.Like its partners  France is convinced that this movement towards Europe's unity would lose its significance and thereby its force  if it led Europe to turn inwards on itself. The Twelve have demonstrated their firmness in the face of rising protectionism and continue to favour the development of foreign trade. The world's leading exporter  the Community is also one of the most open markets. The majority of its imports are exempt from all customs duties or levies  the exemption being applicable to 90 per cent of the products from the developing countries. The Lomé Convention  which governs the privileged relations with African  Caribbean and Pacific countries  has established an exemplary form of North-South co-operation. The system of generalized preferences offers other countries important guarantees with respect to the flow of their products to the Community's markets. Finally  Europe has concluded association and co-operation agreements with regional organizations and numerous States  particularly Mediterranean States.We are now prepared to go further  and accordingly the Twelve are entering on a new round of trade talks. These will include  as everyone knows  the sensitive area of agriculture. The Community  including France  are prepared to address seriously the imbalances of world agricultural markets  but we cannot be asked to call into question the principles and achievements of the common agricultural policy. The new round of trade negotiations that I have just mentioned offers an opportunity for considerable trade liberalization. World economic expansion is based on the further development of international trade  which should largely benefit the poorest countries  with each country or group of States doing its share.There has been a greater awareness over the past year that the disorder in the international monetary system since the end of the 1960s has undoubtedly been one of the causes of the mediocre performance of the world economy. France has worked consistently for greater stability in exchange rates and the reduction of interest rates. In this respect 1987 has been characterized by changes in the right direction. The Louvre agreement  concluded in Paris last February and confirmed by the Venice summit  comprises  as we had hoped  specific objectives for the stabilization of exchange rates of the principal currencies and the convergence of economic policies. Such agreements have produced encouraging initial results  but clearly everyone realizes that much remains to be done to ensure a stable international monetary order.We have long advocated concerted action in the area of commodities. Prices for these commodities continue to be unstable and low. Apart from sound market organization  diversifying the economies of the producer countries is a necessity. One of the headings of the Common Fund meets this objective. France hopes that this agreement will enter into force at an early date. 0f all the evils troubling the world economy  the most serious and the most fraught with danger is  of course  the issue of third world indebtedness. For some States the situation has become critical. Prance is aware of the difficulties they are encountering in this respect  especially in Africa; it is familiar with the adjustments and restructuring many of them have courageously undertaken  and the painful consequences that can result for the populations. These States should benefit most particularly from the international community's support  and the conclusions of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the African continent should not be allowed to remain a dead letter.France has made proposals regarding debt that would extend the grace period and time-frame for repayment in the case of the poorest countries. These recommendations have since begun to be implemented by the Paris Club. Financial flows to the developing nations should be substantially increased. All lenders should contribute  and the participation of banks is more necessary than ever  especially in Latin America. The multilateral institutions should also step up their efforts to help the third world. It is  therefore  indispensable for the resources of the World Bank to be enlarged and for the discussions on tripling the resources of the Structural Adjustment Facility to be completed before year's end so that concessional loans to the poorest countries can be speedily increased.Increasing official development assistance remains an imperative need. In the case of Prance  it has been decided to raise aid for development to 0.54 per cent of the gross national product in 1988. We are continuing to move closer to the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product for development assistance. Our effort will be directed as a matter of priority to the poorest nations  whose situation should be examined anew by the international community. Accordingly we have offered to host the next conference of the least developed countries in Paris in 1990. Without consultation and dialogue control of the international economic situation will not be attained. For this reason we welcome the results of the recent United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  at which the European Community made a substantial contribution  as my colleague from Denmark  current President of the Twelve  has recalled. That Conference revealed the existence of a general resolve to address the third world's problems realistically  in a spirit of openness and generosity. Efforts to come up with solutions to the problem of underdevelopment and  by the same token  to improve the material situation of the majority of human beings  cannot be separated from the international community's struggle to ensure greater respect for human rights in the world.Human rights transcend East and West  North and South. At issue is the dignity of each man. It is inadmissible to say that one can look at the human person differently depending on place or circumstances  or to think that liberty may have several faces or that certain fundamental rights should have priority over others. France will never be silent so long as human rights ate trampled underfoot  whether it be in South Africa or Cambodia  Afghanistan or Chile. It will always be on the side of those who want democracy to live despite threats  whether in the case  today  of the Philippines or Haiti.Precisely because Prance wishes to be above reproach on this score  it recently organized a vote on self-determination in New Caledonia. The New Caledonian population made a clear and indisputable choice  in conditions that were calm and beyond dispute  in favour of the territory remaining within the French Republic. In the spirit of open-mindedness that has always been its hallmark  the French Government is proposing  after broad consultations with all Caledonians  a statute for broad autonomy that should be acceptable to all.Among attacks on individual rights  one of the most odious is terrorism because it systematically targets innocent people and resorts to the most cowardly actions - from a bomb thrown to kill in a place of worship or in a department store  to the taking of hostages  accompanied by blackmail for their lives  thereby submitting the victims to interminable torture and their families to unbearable anguish. Experience has shown dramatically that no State  however powerful  no person  however well protected  is safe from this scourge. No struggle  however legitimate  can Justify resorting to such crimes which constitute  along with the intolerance and fanaticism that feed them  an ongoing threat to the entire international community.The measures that must be taken at the national level to prevent  fight and punish terrorism cannot be totally effective unless they are backed by a more concrete co-operation among States. The efforts against this outrage should be accompanied by unequivocal condemnation  no encouragement or complicity  even passive  should be tolerated. France urges all countries of the world to pursue this fight unsparingly  unceasingly  with absolute resolve  until this leprosy of our age is completely tooted out.In conclusion  whether we are talking about East-West relations  the settlement of crises or responses to the major issues of our time  much still remains to be done. Were the international community  out of weariness or discouragement in the face of constantly new obstacles  to give up in one or another area  all our efforts would be reduced to nothing.These are the responsibilities of the United Nations. It is easy to highlight the shortcomings  the defects  the red tape of the United Nations. There is nothing surprising about this since these deficiencies are our own and pertain to each and every one of us.First we must adapt our Organization to the changes taking place in the world and undertake the necessary reforms while preserving the indispensable balances. We should be distrustful of reforms that would undermine the foundations of the system put in place in San Francisco it has proved itself irreplaceable. Real reforms should have as their objective a better Implementation of the Chatter and a better functioning of the machinery. This is why we believe the prompt implementation of the conclusions of the Group of 18 is desirable  and we are hoping for a settlement of the financial problem weighing over the life of our Organization and its specialized agencies. This is also why we  together with all the French-speaking nations recently represented at the Quebec Summit  are asking for the strict application of the regulations regarding the use of languages  especially French.With regard to what has been done  as well as what remains to be done  we know that the Organization has been and will be able to rely on the man who is at one and the same time its soul and its principal officer  the Secretary-General. I should like to express again to Mr. Perez de Cuellar the French Government's high regard and appreciation for the remarkable services he renders the international community with a skill  talent and courage that has earned him the esteem and the constant support of all of us.This mission  more than any other  is performed in the service of peace. Over-used and often misused  the word ""peace"" must remain the expression of our greatest ambition and  at the same time  the expression of the greatest reason. Our highest priority  of course  is to put an end to conflicts: solutions imposed by force will never be as enduring as a settlement freely negotiated and consented to. Efforts to bring about peace must also include organizing an effective and controlled disarmament that ensures our security. Working for peace  lastly  means addressing the causes of conflicts and bringing about the conditions that lessen tension. Security  disarmament and development  as was shown by the recent United Nations Conference devoted to this relationship  remain Interdependent Hence the reasonable ambition which is ours: namely  a genuine peace that la not dissociated from the reduction of inequalities in the world  nor from aid to development and co-operation.Here again  we find the central role o£ the United Nations  together with all the specialized agencies of the United Nations family  in ensuring that the Immense wealth engendered by modern technology should benefit not a few peoples but the greatest possible number. There  transcending quarrels often Inherited from centuries past  lies the true challenge of our age. "
"51",2482,"GAB",42,1987,"﻿At this forty-second session of the General Assembly  it is fortunate that the United Nations has honoured you. Sir  by electing you President. Your election  which comes at a time when the United Nations is reviewing its past  taking stock of its present and pondering its future  is for my delegation and myself a most pleasant opportunity to congratulate you most warmly. We are all the more pleased in that the Assembly has  through you  singled our and honoured the German Democratic Republic  your beautiful and great country  with which Gabon has long maintained the closest links. We are convinced that under your leadership  arid thanks to your commitment  lucidity and selflessness  our work will be brought to a happy conclusion. In this respect ray delegation assures you of its full co-operation. We should like to pay a tribute also to Ambassador Choudhury  your predecessor  whose actions throughout the forty-first session of the General Assembly and whose outstanding qualities encouraged the hope and convinced us that there is always in the spirit of man the resources needed to strive for the best : and the most just for all.The excellent report of the Secretary-General is a proof of his determination and courage in tackling the problems with which it deals. We assure him that in all his undertakings and in the comprehensive reforms that he is proposing  we are and shall continue to be at his side  combining our will and our strength with his.Finally  I greet the representatives of Member States  with whom we share the efforts and responsibilities of this session so that together we can contribute positively to the strengthening of the principles enshrined m the Charter.The celebration two years ago of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations gave my country an opportunity to express the hope that the Organization would do everything possible to achieve the purposes and principles set out when it was established to meet the hopes that each of its Members placed in it. These include the maintenance of world peace and security and the promotion of international co-operation towards the complementarity of our economies.Peace and development are not just two major questions of concern to the world today  but the very heart of the problems facing our Organization. In general  the United Nations has certainly made praiseworthy efforts to instil in the economic relations among States a striving for peace and an ideal of justice  which are the necessary conditions of the establishment of a new international economic order. However  its clear shortcomings must be put on the debit side of its actions. We note in particular that it is far from having completely achieved its goals and from playing its full role  certain big countries showing a lack of goodwill in this respect.In today's world the arms race  acts of aggression and regional conflicts are a constant source of concern for developing countries which are striving to protect their independence  sovereignty and security and working actively to develop their economies and strengthen international co-operation. Nevertheless  the talks that have been going on at the highest level over the last few months between the United States and the Soviet Union with a view to concluding an agreement on nuclear disarmament offer a glimmer of hope. Gabon cannot but encourage such initiatives.It is now a fact that certain States  directly or indirectly  are cultivating egocentrism  thus weakening the multilateral development of international relations. The loss of enthusiasm for multilateralism  caused essentially by States preoccupied with their own interests  relegates to the background the ideals which were supported unanimously in 1945. This is a subject of profound concern for my country  for this attitude seems likely to make more acute the major problems of the time  particularly those of peace and security  justice and dignity among peoples and nations  international co-operation and the progress of mankind.Regarding the questions on the agenda for this session  I stress the unchanging position of my Government on the problems of security and the arms race. Gabon is deeply devoted to the fundamental principles and ideals o± the Charter and has always advocated the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. It remains convinced that security cannot be maintained in a climate characterized by the use of force  military interventions  acts of aggression or the occupation of territories by foreign forces. Security and disarmament are closely linked. Consequently  international security cannot be strengthened by increasing armament. Only the creation of a climate of mutual trust in relations among States can lead to the solution of security problems.Moreover  over the last year there seems to have been no sign of feasible solutions to the various problems facing the United Nations; some of which  such as that of the situation in South Africa  have  rather  grown worse. The United Nations has branded apartheid  a crime against humanity  for the racial oppression of the South African people  the illegal occupation of Namibia and the constant acts of intimidation and aggression against the front-line States could hardly be more accurately described. Having long flouted the many appeals of the General Assembly  the Security Council  the Organization of African Unity  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries that it put an end to the hateful practice of apartheid. South Africa arrogantly defies the universal consensus and is perfecting its system of racial oppression.In flagrant and deliberate violation of the Charter and the elementary norms of international law governing the behaviour of States  the South African Government continues its acts of armed aggression against neighbouring States  with the avowed intention of destabilizing them.The imposition of the state of emergency has further complicated the already complex South African question. Unfortunately  strategic interests and the possible loss of the vast profits which the allies are making under the reign of apartheid seem to prevail over the many pertinent appeals to the Security Council finally to exert its authority.The international community should seize true opportunity offered by the present session of the General Assembly to demand that Pretoria put an end to repression  bantustanization  the banishment  harassment of black leaders fighting for their independence  and the extermination of freedom fighters  and begin as soon as possible a constructive dialogue with the oppressed black population  in order that it may at last freely exercise its rights.Apartheid cannot be reformed. No attempt to reform that hateful system should be encouraged. It must be eradicated and destroyed. It is the entire South African population that must decide the fate of its country  without distinction on the ground of race  colour  sex or belief  on a basis of full equality.For its part  the Territory made the responsibility of the United Nations  Namibia  last year commemorated the twentieth anniversary of its illegal occupation by the country of apartheid.During this time  the Pretoria regime has developed in the Territory colonialism  apartheid and aggression  all practices rejected by the international community as seriously threatening world peace and security. At the same time  foreign economic activities and interests stubbornly obstruct the road to the exercise of full and genuine independence by the valiant Namibian people  under the enlightened leadership of its sole representative  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). These same foreign interests are accelerating the systematic plundering of the natural wealth of the territory in flagrant violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.For my delegation  only the relevant decisions of our Organization can be considered as valid measures likely to guarantee the independence of the Namibian people. Consequently  full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which defines a coherent plan for the immediate independence of Namibia  is still the only framework likely to promote the decolonization process in Namibian territory. Gabon considers with interest  and supports  all attempts on the part of the parties concerned for the independence of Namibia to accelerate this process and considers the fallacious linkage of the granting of independence to Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban troops based in Angola to be a subterfuge.I should like to reaffirm strongly my country's support for SWAPO in its implacable struggle for the liberation of Namibia. These are in no way mere statements of intention. Gabon has long since gone beyond this stage and is now undertaking concrete measures  of which I will only mention the granting of diplomatic status to SWAPO  the issuance of special postage stamps the profits from which will go to SWAPO  and the granting of stipends to Namibian students.To sum up  it is a direct responsibility on the part of the United Nations to guarantee the Namibian people the exercise of the right to self-determination and to ensure the independence of Namibia through free elections. The United Nations cannot abdicate its responsibility to put an end to the constant acts of aggression perpetrated by South Africa in the region.Likewise guided by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations  like those of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  my country is following with great concern the development of the conflicts  particularly in Chad and Western Sahara  that are tearing fraternal peoples apart.The question of Chad has always been viewed in its two aspects: the intra-Chadian problem on the one hand  and the border conflict between Chad and Libya on the other.As regards the first area  everyone here will remember the contribution made by my country and its Head  Al Hadj Omar Bongo  in the reconciliation of all the sons of this fraternal country. It is comforting that the leaders of the various components of the opposition are actively trying to work out the unification process.As regards the border conflict between Chad and Libya  the General Assembly will recall that on 6 April 1983 the Security Council referred the matter to the OAU for consideration within the framework for appropriate OAU machinery. One of these mechanisms is precisely the Ad Hoc Committee set up in 1977 by the fourteenth summit meeting of the OAU and chaired since then by Gabon.That is why  in application of the resolution adopted at the twenty-third summit meeting of the OAU  and taking into consideration the worsening of the military situation in the area. President Bongo had  first  made an appeal to the two parties in the conflict  and then undertook efforts to convene the Committee in Lusaka  with the agreement of President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia  current Chairman of the OAU. It is my privilege to confirm to the Assembly  as many eminent delegations have done before me  that the Ad Hoc Committee did indeed meet in the capital of Zambia on 23 and 24 October  under the chairmanship of El Hadj Omar Bongo  with the presence of President Kaunda and with the effective participation of the Heads of State of the following Member States:President Diouf of Senegal and President Chissano of Mozambique; and of other Member States  namely Algeria  Cameroon and Nigeria  who were represented at the ministerial level.For the first time the Ad Hoc Committee had the participation of both parties in the conflict  Chad represented by its Head of State  President Hissene Habre  and Libya by the head of the People's Bureau of External Relations. After expressing their pleasure with the Chadian and Libyan decisions to respond positively to the appeal of the current President or the OAU that they lay down their arms and co-operate frankly and loyally with the Committee  the Committee called upon both parties  first  to make available to it all relevant documentation to support their arguments  by 30 October 1 87 at the latest; secondly  to maintain and consolidate the cease-fire at all levels; thirdly  to refrain from any action that would make the conflict an international one.Moreover  the following timetable was drawn up; from 30 November to 30 December 1987  a meeting of juridical and cartographic experts at Libreville; on 7 January 1988  a meeting of ministers in Libreville; in the first two weeks of January 198 8  a meeting of Heads of State at Dakar.Respect for this timetable and strict observance of the Lusaka decision by the parties to the conflict should lead to further progress in their effort undertaken since 1977 both at the OAU level and at the United Nations level  to achieve a peaceful settlement of this dispute. Despite alarming reports received lately  we believe that the two parties in conflict will not dare to continue to turn a deaf ear to the various appeals made  or remain deaf to wisdom and reason. That same striving for peace among nations through dialogue has always been advocated by Gabon with regard to the question of Western Sahara.My country is still convinced that only the organization of a referendum on free democratic and honest self-determination can lead to a final settlement of this conflict. We therefore welcome the recent initiative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  who visited Morocco and Algeria to study on the spot the practical conditions for organizing such a referendum.I shall not conclude my statement on the political situation on the African continent without mentioning the question  still topical  of the Comorian island of Mayotte. My Government reaffirms its solidarity with the Comorian people and condemns and rejects all new forms of consultation that might be organized on the Comorian territory of Mayotte and reiterates its desire to continue to pursue the efforts already under way to return the Comorian island of Mayotte to its motherland as soon as possible.My Government's position as regards the Middle East is clear. We m Gabon are persuaded that the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories  occupied since 1967 is the sine qua non condition for achieving a just and lasting solution. We believe that the Palestinians  like all other people in the world  must claim the full exercise of their legitimate rights  including that of existing within secure and internationally recognized borders. We are convinced that the Palestine Liberation Organization as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  must play an essential role in the efforts made to find a solution to this problem  efforts in which all interested parties should participate. The situation in Lebanon causes us concern  because of  among other things  the excellent relations between our two countries. We urge all the parties concerned to put an end to that fratricidal struggle and to devote themselves to the difficult but noble task of rebuilding the country.As regards the conflict between Iran and Iraq  Gabon in particular and the international community in general have several times expressed their extreme concern over that endless and bloody confrontation. It is absolutely essential that there be a cease-fire and that the two sides accept and fully apply all the relevant Security Council resolutions. In order to speed up the opening of negotiations  Gabon encourages and supports the international initiatives - above all  of course  the action taken by the Secretary-General  who  under Security Council resolution 598 (1987)   adopted unanimously on 20 July  went to Baghdad and Tehran to work out a platform for negotiations.In Afghanistan foreign intervention has fomented the war for nearly eight years. Far from being ended  the fighting is spreading. The only way out is through the search for a political solution guaranteeing both the withdrawal of foreign forces and the free determination of their future by the Afghan people.As for the painful situation in Kampuchea  Gabon reaffirms its condemnation of the occupation of that country by foreign forces. It deplores the sacrifices inflicted on the innocent civilian population and recalls the urgent need to find a peaceful solution based  here too  on the withdrawal of foreign forces and the national reconciliation of all the sons of that friendly country.The division of the Korean people  a long-running drama  having gone on for 40 years  continues. Gabon  which is pleased to count both Koreas among its best friends  continues to support a negotiated solution aimed at the peaceful reunification of those two parts of the same country. Latin America is another area of our world where tension is increasing daily. My country believes that only the implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence  good neighbourliness  the non-use of force  respect for territorial integrity and non-interference advocated by the Charter of our Organization can contribute to halting the worsening of the climate in that region. Therefore  we renew our support for the Contadora group and welcome the complementary contributions of the Lima Group  which provide propitious frameworks for renewing the chances of a better understanding between all peace-loving people.The pitfalls of our era require from us nothing less than respect for the ideals on which the United Nations was built. The Organization can be strong only through our strength? it can be rational only through our reason; it can be efficient only through the means we can offer it.Having created the United Nations for a better world  we must know that ultimately the world will only be the result of what we collectively intend to make of it. That applies both to political and to economic problems  on which I shall now put forward my country's position.It must be recognized that the world economy  as we see it today  is naturally a result of policies advocated  followed or applied in the past. They have led us into a cycle marked by negative changes  all of which were seen during the course of 1986. They are characterized by a new collapse in production and in the international trade system  as well as by an increase in protectionism. All those negative factors  together with world monetary disorder and the imbalance in capital markets  clearly have an unfavourable impact on the economies of developing countries.Our countries  whose economies are essentially based on the commodities trade  have overall been seriously affected in recent years by the prolonged weakening in the prices of those products. The oil-producing countries in particular  including Gabon  face a grave economic crisis as a result of the fall both in the price of oil and in the exchange rate of the dollar. In American dollars the annual average price was 3Ü per cent lower in 19tìl that it had been in 1980 - about 20 per cent in real terms. In other words  Africa's share of world commodity exports fell  for most commodities  particularly in the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s.Gabon believes that the machinery of the Integrated Programme for Commodities  and its accompanying Common Fund  should have the full support of all trading partners. Stabilization of commodity markets requires appropriate regulation at the international level. It should be noted that trade flows have been such that the exports of developing countries fell from 33.6 per cent in 1980 to 24.6 per cent in 1986. In the same period their imports fell from 28.7 to 25.2 per cent.An additional cause of concern is the effect on the international market in commodities from developing countries of the proliferation of substitute products from developed countries. In the light of what I have said  which is by no means exhaustive  my country endorses the fundamental conclusion of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in his report for the past year that.· ""In the present situation the improvement in the world financial and trade environment is the key that should make it possible for the developing countries to begin to realize their development potential."" We feel that that is a realistic evaluation  for any effort made at the national level by our country is doomed to failure if it is not supported by a real change in international economic structures. It is in this context - a reduction in international trade and an increase in protectionism in all its forms  the floating of the main reference currencies  a fall in public aid and a hardening of the terms of private loans - that we note with a feeling of anguish and impotence the disturbing increase in Africa's foreign debt. In fact  by the end of 19t85 Africa's total debt amounted to $162 billion  more than $19 billion of which is swallowed up each year by debt servicing. Various solutions have been advocated  among them the rescheduling of debts. I take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the representative of Canada and  through him  to his great and generous country  which in a magnanimous action has just wiped out the debts of seven African countries  including Gabon  in a total amount of $250 million.It is in order to find a solution to this grave problem that the African countries decided  in the Organization of African Unity  to hold a conference on Africa's foreign debt. On several occasions  under the terms of the relevant resolutions and declarations of that organization  our countries have solemnly undertaken to honour their debts. Africa's creditors should therefore feel protected from the confrontation which they seem to fear  and should not regard this conference as the framework for defining a strategy aimed at refusal to pay.Beyond this question of the external debt of the developing countries there is another question  which is linked to it: the absence of international liquidity facing our countries  which reduces and hinders our development possibilities. Hence  the five-Member group of experts established in July 1У84 by the late Prime Minister of India  Indira Gandhi - at that time the Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries - recommended in its report a greater allocation of resources and the implementation of a process of reform of the international monetary and financial systems.Finally  if development is to be integral  we cannot hide its social aspect  because it is precisely that aspect which most directly affects the people - who  as the President of the Republic of Gabon constantly repeats  are at the start and the end of any action for development. We note with interest the inclusion in the agenda of this session of items relating to the fate of the disabled and the elimination of all forms of discrimination based on sex  as well as items relating to actions to be taken to ensure the protection of women. My Government stresses how important these problems are.The distortions created by a period of relative economic growth and by the social changes it engendered have made my Government aware of the need to establish appropriate compensatory mechanisms to ensure  among other things - in the framework of its social action policy - the social reintegration and rehabilitation of the physically and mentally disabled. Moreover  women  like men  have access to education  vocational training  employment  and government - which now includes five women. We view our policy of social assistance  in the context of national solidarity  and our policy of improving the status of women as being in full accordance with the relevant provisions of tried resolutions of the Organization in this field.That  in substance  is the message which  on behalf of my country  Gabon  I have the pleasure to address to the General Assembly on this solemn occasion. May the words it contains find in Members countries the favourable response which it deserves as a contribution to the dawning of a new era of peace  justice and harmony in the world."
"52",2529,"GBR",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  let me first extend to you my congratulations on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly  and at the same time express my country's warm appreciation to the outgoing President  and representative of a fellow Commonwealth country  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh.The General Assembly meets this year at a moment of great hope for the world  yet also at a moment of grave and mounting danger: hope because  after years of effort  an historic arms agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union is within sight; and grave and mounting danger because the conflict between Iran and Iraq poses daily a more serious threat to wider peace and security.In the Gulf two proud  independent countries  themselves both founding Members of the United Nations  have been mauling each other relentlessly for seven years. That is almost twice as long as the First World War. We have before our eyes the image of hundreds of thousands of corpses  young people blown up  gunned down or gassed to death  civilians on both sides mercilessly bombed. The combatants have moreover extended this senseless destruction and loss of life into the international waters of the Gulf. Only two days ago another British vessel  the Gentle Breeze was attacked with loss of innocent life. This was a disgraceful and unprovoked act of aggression against an unarmed vessel  the sixth attack on a British ship in the Gulf.Ships have sailed this great seaway for centuries. It is an international thoroughfare; no State may dictate who uses it. As it has done throughout its long history  the United Kingdom will continue to champion freedom of navigation. Individual States that take action to uphold that freedom are entitled to support from the entire community of nations. Yet today  and for many months now  freedom of navigation in these waters is threatened - threatened by indiscriminate attacks on unarmed vessels  by harassment of innocent merchant shipping and  most reckless of all  by the laying of random mines. The world saw another example on Monday  as Iran sowed mines in the path of a convoy in international waters. The response of the United States to that insane act was fully justified  and it should be supported by all those who wish to bring this conflict to an end  for the stability of the entire region is menaced by this escalating threat to peace.The challenge to this institution and all it stands for could not be more direct. The blunt truth is that the way in which the United Nations handles the conflict between Iran and Iraq must have a decisive effect upon its reputation in the eyes of all the peoples whom we represent.If the United Nations is to rise to this challenge  to help end this grotesque slaughter  then we must strive for and maintain a degree of unity that has hardly ever been achieved before. Other international groupings can give a powerful lead  by condemning the conflict and mobilizing all their energies in the cause of Peace. That is why we value the mounting weight of support from the Organization of African Unity  the Arab League  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. In the same sense  the twelve members of the European Community are giving their United backing.All this shows how deeply the world cares about ending the Gulf conflict. But caring is not enough. The Security Council has a particular responsibility to act. That responsibility has been unanimously accepted by the Council  and that unanimity has been built on the collective determination of the five permanent members. Each permanent member has resisted the temptation to put its national interest before the cause of peace - and must continue to do so  for there is an overriding need for the five to continue working together  as the motor of action by the whole Security Council. No one has understood and emphasized that need more than the Secretary—General himself. So it was particularly fitting that he personally should have undertaken the difficult and delicate mission recently entrusted to him by the Security Council· For this  as for all his service in the cause of peace  he deserves our warm thanks and admiration.As a result  we now know the views of the Iraqi and Iranian Governments on resolution 598 (1987). That resolution  legally binding  demanded that both Iran and Iraq should cease fire. It paid due attention to the legitimate concerns and grievances of both Iran and Iraq. And  rightly  it provided that in the absence of compliance the measures necessary for enforcement would be put in place  The Security Council's determination to ensure compliance must remain firm. What we now have to decide is whether the Security Council should move without further ado to an arms embargo.After Iran's deeds and words this week  can anyone still believe that it intends to comply with the resolution? Monday's two unprovoked attacks  with missile and mine  show Iran's true intentions. So do the words of its President from this rostrum yesterday. He described the Security Council as ""a paper factory for issuing worthless and ineffective orders"". He invited the world to conclude that ""the only option left is to use violence' (A/42/PV.6  p. 57).The United Kingdom therefore thinks it essential now to start work on the further measures foreseen in resolution 598 (1987). The first step should be an arms embargo  to prevent the flow of arms to those wishing to ignore the United Nations and to prolong the conflict. For action is needed - action to show that the Security Council is neither worthless nor ineffective  that it will uphold its authority. We in Britain will not hesitate to take the steps at home which we judge necessary. I can announce today that we have decided to close down the operations of the Iranian military procurement offices in London. For us  the cynical attack on the ""Gentle Breeze"" was the last straw. The United Nations as a whole should learn the same lesson from what Iran has said and done this week.The Gulf conflict is the most imminent danger. But it is not the only threat to world peace. The Arab-Israel dispute has already dragged on for decades. But the present deadlock is no solution  no panacea. Far from it: It is highly unstable. In the occupied territories  misery and repression persist. In Israel itself  the Palestinian population is rapidly expanding. Already two generations of Arabs and Israelis have lived out their lives under the shadow of war and insecurity. Yet the basis for the settlement that must one day be reached is plain to see: Israel's right to a secure existence; and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.Virtually the whole world now accepts the idea of an international conference under United Nations auspices. The United Kingdom is convinced of the need for it. An international conference will provide a framework for negotiations. It will not be a trick or a trap. It will not impose solutions  nor have the right to veto agreements reached between the parties. It need not be feared by any man of goodwill. Nor can the international community ignore Lebanon  where the United Nations Interim Force needs our full support. The Lebanese must be left to tackle their problems free from outside interference. All foreign forces should withdraw  and Lebanon's international borders must be respected. There are far too many innocent victims of all these conflicts. They include those who have been taken hostage  some of whom  alas  are citizens of my own country. We have some experience of defending ourselves against terrorism. Our position is clear and quite unshakeable. We will do no deals with terrorists. That is the only policy that makes sense. Every sordid deal by a Government  every ransom paid  makes another terrorist act worthwhile and increases the threat to all out citizens.I say to those who are holding Britons hostage; we shall never submit to your blackmail. You will gain nothing. You will only bring your cause into disrepute. Set the hostages free. I urge all those with Influence over those holding hostages to say the same. And I urge this whole Assembly  on behalf of the hostages of every nation  to send the same plain and urgent message.Another problem cries out for a United response from the International community; southern Africa - never off the agenda of this Organization  and tightly so. For although South Africa may not be the only example of racial Intolerance in this world  it is unique in the Institutionalised domination of other races by the white population. Apartheid is morally repugnant  indefensible  inhuman. But it is indeed more than that; it is also suicidal for those who practise it. All the lessons of history tell us that. Apartheid breeds discontent  violence and revolution. We understand the seething discontent of the black population  who can fall to be moved by the thought that a whole generation  as come of age while Nelson Mandela has remained behind bars?And yet a prosperous  stable and just South Africa cannot be built by violence that is the way to ruin  despair and death. Those who rule South Africa must change course before it is too late. There are signs that some of them realize that  but reforms so far have been too slow and too limited. The time bomb is in place and the clock is ticking; it must be defused before it is too late.We all share one common aim: the elimination of apartheid as quickly as possible. What can the world do to encourage South Africa in the right direction? The answer cannot lie in further measures which would serve only to unite the whites against the world  to slow the process of change  to prolong apartheid  and to blight the lives of the very people we wish to help. Yet we must maintain the moral pressure on the rulers of South Africa. They must not be allowed to put their faith in the status quo. We must convince them that peace and security can be achieved only through genuine dialogue with the leaders of the other races  and by comprehensive reform. We are working to that end.Of course  apartheid afflicts not only those who live in South Africa; it also destabilizes South Africa's neighbours. The United Kingdom is taking a lead in helping the front-line States: for some of them we are giving practical help in training and equipping their military forces to ensure the security of their transport links; for others we have given extensive aid to develop alternative transport systems and to pay for training and equipment. Our aid to the States of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) over the last five years totals more than $1 billion. Few if any of the States represented here today can match that record.South Africa is by far the world's worst example of racial intolerance. But very few areas of the world are free from quarrels founded on differences of race  religion or language. Such quarrels need not be insoluble. The European Community is one of the most successful examples in history of making shared values and aspirations rise from the ashes of war and division. Yesterday's speech by the Foreign Minister of Denmark  which now holds the presidency  was eloquent testimony to our progress towards ""ever closer union"". In Sri Lanka there are hopeful signs that ethnic conflicts might be ended. The agreement between President Jayawardene and Mr. Gandhi is a bold step forward. The deplorable terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka President last month underlined the dangers besetting those who work for an agreement of this kind. They displayed great courage. Everyone must now work for its continuing success.Likewise in Cyprus we support the Secretary-General's efforts to bring the two sides towards a settlement. The United Kingdom knows that difficult decisions are needed. We call on both sides to show the necessary courage.And  in Korea  the United Kingdom notes with close interest the recent moves to restart dialogue between North and South. We support moves to reduce the tensions in that divided peninsula. We hope that the Korean people may soon be represented here. All these political problems demand the urgent attention of the United Nations. So do those in the economic field  which directly affect so many Member States.One economic burden  one which has featured prominently in many speeches from this rostrum  is the cycle of debt. Here Britain has recently put forward an initiative to help the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa  which are striving to set their economies on a sustainable basis for development. This means converting aid loans into grants  rescheduling official loans with longer grace periods  and reducing interest rates on official loans. Already in this region we have written off aid debts to the tune of £244 million.Yet despite all our efforts  glut and famine still disfigure the world. In the industrial countries we subsidize our farmers to produce food nobody wants and sell it below the cost of production. In developing countries  the subsidy  if there is one  goes to the consumer  and price control deprives the farmer of the incentive to produce more. So he leaves the land to find work in the city - and his Government has to buy from abroad the food he would have produced. The cost to the world and the waste are enormous.The huge and urgent task of agricultural reform is to recreate market incentives and progressively to eliminate protectionist measures around the world. Food must be on the agenda whenever nations gather for discussion. It will be much on our minds at next month's important meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in Vancouver  to which Britain much looks forward.	.In Europe in the last 40 years we have shown that the divisions of history can be healed by wholly peaceful means  by political co-operation and by economic integration. Military force  as we Europeans know to our cost  seldom brings a lasting solution to anything) it can be only a last resort when everything else has failed.That is just as true in Central America. Here  too  long-term security can only be assured by a peaceful settlement reached with the free consent of all its peoples  democratically expressed. That is why we welcomed the agreement signed by the five Central American Presidents in Guatemala in August. We wish it every success.It is true too in the South Atlantic. We shall continue to look for ways of restoring more normal relations with Argentina while upholding the Falkland Islanders' rights to self-determination.This universal truth applies to Asia as well  and nowhere more than in Afghanistan. During eight years of Soviet occupation  tens of thousands have been killed and 5 million refugees have been driven to leave their country. That is a bitter indictment of Soviet polices and a grave burden for Pakistan  which has shouldered it nobly. But the Soviet Union of today is not the Soviet Union which invaded Afghanistan. Since he took over the reins of power  Mr. Gorbachev has made a remarkable effort to reform  to restructure  to let in light and air from the outside. We have publicly applauded this  and we wish him well. We believe that a more prosperous and efficient Soviet Union will be easier for the world to live with and for its own citizens to live in.I believe that Mr. Gorbachev knows that he needs a stable international environment to carry out his programme of reform. I detect a genuine wish to find a way to end the war in Afghanistan and to bring Soviet soldiers back from the rocky valleys where so many of them have fallen. Of course that is not an easy task. But the Soviet leaders must make the necessary leap of Imagination if glasnost and perestroika are to have the effect that they should on Soviet foreign  as well as domestic  policy.The Soviet Union can reasonably seek to avoid instability or threats to its security on its borders. But it must accept that only when a government emerges in Afghanistan that truly commands the confidence and trust of the Afghan people  only then will Afghanistan be stable. The Soviet Union must grasp the nettle: it must withdraw its troops and let the Afghan people decide their own future.So yet again we meet in the shadow of numerous conflicts. But the gloom is not unbroken. The arms control agreement announced last week by the United States and Soviet Foreign Ministers has lit a beacon of hope for all those who see in greater co-operation and mutual trust between the super-Powers the key to a less troubled world  for the hope must be that an intermediate-nuclear-force (INF) treaty  once concluded  will have benefits extending beyond the agreement itself. It has always been clear that arms control cannot on its own carry the weight of placing and keeping East-West relations on an even keel. Indeed  recent years have shown how difficult it is to make progress in arms negotiations if relations between East and West are generally sour.But these things do cut both ways. An INF agreement which  for the first time ever  bites into the nuclear arsenals of each side  which  for the first time ever  provides for stringent verification - such an agreement should significantly increase the mutual confidence without which any significant progress in East-West relations is unattainable.We have not suddenly arrived at some promised land  but an INF agreement will give a shot of adrenalin to the often lethargic and lumbering process of arms control. The next priorities are a 50 per cent cut in the strategic arsenals of the super-Powers  a world-wide ban on chemical weapons  the removal of imbalances in conventional weapons from the Atlantic to the Orals. They are complex and difficult and will test to the utmost the skill  patience and determination of both sides' negotiators.But an INF agreement will begin to erode the thick ice-cap of mistrust that has accumulated over the years. Of course the melting process will itself release dangerous ice blocks and floes around which we shall all have to navigate with care.The key is greater trust. If we can see the Soviet Union making a genuine effort to co-operate in solving the world's regional tensions; if we can see them putting the solution of such tensions before the pursuit of national interest; if we can see a more just  free and humane society developing in the Soviet Union  then I think we shall see greater trust between East and West.I am not unhopeful. The co-operation between the Five on Security Council resolution 598 (1987) may be a sign of better things to come; and the· last year has seen real progress on human rights in the Soviet Union. But there is still a long way to go. For our part we have worked intensively to build up the East-West dialogue. The visit to Moscow by the British Prime Minister and myself in March was an occasion for unusually deep and valuable exchanges. They will continue.At the beginning of this statement I spoke of a moment of hope. The INF agreement and the impending summit between President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev are indeed reason for hope. I think it will be the prayer of every one of us here that' that still faint shaft of light will grow and will drive the shadows of fear and distrust ever backward until they ate finally eliminated from this world.In opening the first General Assembly session in London  Clement Attlee  then British Prime Minister  described the simple truth behind the formation of the United Nations; ""The realization by all nations that without co-operation for peace there can be no security for any nation"".That is still the most basic truth. That is why we are here."
"53",2600,"GHA",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the people and the Government of Ghana  I extend to you. Sir  our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your election is testimony to your high personal qualities and an honour to your country. To your immediate predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  I extend sincere congratulations on the excellent work he did.A year ago to this day  the United Nations opened on a gloomy note. There was an unjustifiable questioning of confidence by some Member States as the Organization faced a serious financial crisis. However  the Organization has survived the threat to its future as a force for peace and multilateral co-operation.	'Perhaps nowhere is multilateral co-operation more urgently required than in the solution of the critical economic problems facing Africa  And this was recognized in the adoption last year of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery  and Development.In spite of the bold and politically risky economic reform programmes adopted by African countries prior to and in response to the Programme  there is little evidence yet that our developed partners are responding with the necessary resource flows crucial to the success of the Programme. The Secretary-General of the United Nations himself had occasion during the recent Economic and Social Council session to express concern about the inadequate support the international community has given to Africa's efforts.External factors that exacerbate the African economic situation remain unaddressed. The prices of primary commodities on which many African countries depend for their foreign exchange earnings have fallen to their lowest level. The anticipated growth in world trade has not occurred largely because appropriate policy measures to stimulate demand have not been pursued. Africa's efforts to expand the export sector through price incentives and the rehabilitation of infrastructure have been counter-productive because the increased volume of primary commodity exports has created an oversupply and exerted downward pressure on prices. Yet some powerful industrialized countries refuse to join multilateral schemes for stabilizing prices and earnings of developing countries from primary commodities.In this context we welcome the decision of the Soviet Union to sign and ratify the Common Fund Agreement within the framework of the Integrated Programme for commodities. We urge all countries that have not yet signed the Agreement  particularly the leading industrial countries  to overcome their initial reticence and join the Fund.If the current steady decline in primary commodity prices is halted  it will go a long way to redressing the deteriorating terms of trade between the developing countries and the developed countries. Losses suffered by the developing countries  including sub-Saharan African countries  from adverse terms of trade in 1986 alone amounted to $94 billion. This represents effective transfer of resources from poor countries to the rich industrialized countries} it is unconscionable and indefensible.That there are severe constraints imposed on the development efforts of African countries by external indebtedness is recognized by all. The debt-service burden is severely hampering the ability of Africa to pursue growth-oriented adjustment policies. Figures supplied by the United nations system indicate that Africa's debt stood at $2U0 billion in 1986  while debt-service payments actually made by Africa between 1983 and 1985 averaged Í6.4 billion annually  representing about 44 per cent of gross domestic product and almost 200 per cent of their export earnings. There are some countries with critical debt-servicing ratios of about 100 per cent of export earnings and above. For the next three-year period  debt-service payment per annum is expected to increase to $11.5 billion.This huge transfer of resources from the most impoverished continent has been at a great cost to socio-economic development. Investment and import programmes have had to be curtailed drastically. No statistics can aptly describe the misery and deprivation that have been caused. Relief must therefore be swift and adequate.However  the strategy pursued by the donor community and the international financial institutions has primarily been geared towards averting any serious disruption in the financial system rather than alleviating the debt burden. In this connection we recall the consensus resolution adopted by the General Assembly last year on the sort of elements that must go into any strategy for a durable solution of the debt problem.That resolution rightly recognized the vulnerable position of Africa. The international community  pursuant to the provisions of that resolution  pledged to take additional measures to alleviate the continent's onerous debt-service burden. We wish to express our gratitude to Canada  Sweden  the United Kingdom and other countries which have converted some African debts into grants. We also note with appreciation the initiatives of the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Paris Club to get the creditor countries and institutions to grant significant debt relief. For a meaningful impact  we strongly urge greater debt-relief measures  including the spread of repayment over longer periods than the 20 years being suggested. We appreciate that national legislative and administrative procedures for granting debt relief have to be observed. But in view of the urgency of the need  we urge the international community to expedite action.At the same time that this huge transfer of resources from developing to developed countries is taking place  the flow of resources and development finance to the developing countries has declined or stagnated. Private lending has dwindled to a trickle compared to the levels attained a few years ago. Only a few developed countries have attained the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product in development assistance to developing countries.The theme for the recently ended seventh meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII)  that is  revitalizing development  growth and international trade in a more predictable and supportive environment  through multilateral co-operation  could not have been more appropriate. It focuses on the main areas where new policy initiatives are required. In my delegation's view  UNCTAD provides a unique forum for building international consensus on the interrelated issues of money  finance  trade  resource flows and development.Ghana wishes to emphasize today  as we did last year  that in an increasingly interdependent world  the rest of humanity will not remain for long insulated from Africa's misfortunes. We therefore renew  once again  our appeal to all to translate the international gestures of solidarity demonstrated at the special session of the General Assembly on Africa into practical support. I now turn to the political scene. Deserving of particular attention is South Africa's continued destabilization of the front-line States of Angola# Mozambique  Botswana  Zambia and Zimbabwe  in utter disregard of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. This is intended to terrorize those countries into denying support for the liberation movements in South Africa and Namibia and to increase the racist regime's dominance of the sub region.No display of brutal force by the apartheid regime will solve South Africa's mounting domestic problems  the solution of which lies in the adoption of meaningful steps totally to eradicate the apartheid system. The necessary steps include the release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and the initiation of meaningful talks with the legitimate black leadership  with a view to sharing power democratically. The recent encounter in Dakar between a number of anti-apartheid South Africans  mainly white Afrikaners  and the African National Congress and their subsequent visit to some West African capitals  including my own  shows the way to a better future for South Africa.While the system of apartheid persists  the overwhelming majority of the international community supports the isolation of South Africa - economically  politically and socially - as a way of inducing change. We continue to believe that sanctions will hasten the demise of apartheid if the international community exerts co-ordinated and mandatory international pressure on the racist regime  as is possible under Chapter VII of the Charter. The choice has been made  because it is the only peaceful method left if that country is to avoid a major disaster. We appeal to those countries whose economic and other interests make them refuse to follow the rest of humanity to reappraise their positions. The unsettled Question of Namibia's independence continues to pose a serious challenge to the international community  it is unacceptable that South Africa continues to occupy Namibia well over two decades after the United Nations declared its presence in that Territory illegal. This fact in itself seriously undermines the credibility of our Organization  a situation which we should all work to correct. For this reason  the failure of the Security Council to send a collective and unambiguous signal to the South African authorities after its debate of 6 to 9 April on the Namibian independence Question is a matter of deep regret. The negative votes cast by two permanent members of the Council and the several abstentions only served to strengthen South Africa in its continued stubbornness and refusal to co-operate in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978 ).It is even more regrettable for a permanent member of the Security Council to continue to link Namibian independence to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The Namibian independence Question is a decolonisation issue and therefore cannot be linked with a domestic affair of an independent country. Ghana maintains that the people and Government of Angola have the legitimate right to make whatever practical arrangements they think fit for the defence of their country  particularly arrangements necessitated by South Africa's repeated acts of aggression and interference in Angola's domestic affairs. We therefore totally reject the linkage theory and reiterate Ghana's support for the conclusions of the 1986 special session of the General Assembly on Namibia  particularly the call for the isolation of South Africa economically and politically and the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).There are other areas of tension in Africa which deserve close attention  but let me single out Western Sahara and Chad. It is regrettable that  in spite of the decisions taken by the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity (OAO) and the Non-Aligned Movement and the 1975 World Court opinion upholding the primacy of the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara  Morocco continues to hold on to the Territory. Ghana reiterates its support for the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and for the right of the Republic to sovereign existence. We again call upon Morocco to enter into negotiations with the POLISARIO Front  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations  to resolve this matter.On the conflict between Chad and Libya  Ghana wonders whether Chad's interest is best served by raising the matter here in provocative terminology that sets the tone for acrimony. It is as though Chad is repudiating the strategy of the OAU Heads of State or Government  which is aimed at avoiding escalation of the conflict through acrimonious debates  in favour of recourse to quiet diplomacy and mediation for the settlement of the dispute. We do not believe that the interests of Africa and the dignity and integrity of the OAU will be advanced by creating the opportunity for mischief by those whose interest lies in fanning conflict for their own national interests  unrelated to the Chadian or Libyan interest in preserving their sovereignty and territorial integrity-Ghana emphasizes the need for the application of peaceful methods in the resolution of the question of sovereignty over the Aozou strip. This is a question that lends itself to adjudication by the World Court  and Ghana would urge Chad a 3 Libya to follow that course if the mediation efforts of the OAU prove ineffective There is a need for the conflict between Chad and Libya to be brought to an end. We must recognize that a situation of this nature gives Imperialist forces the opportunity to divide and weaken Africa and to subvert the course of the African revolution  of which Libya is a strong pillar of support. In the Middle East the cycle of violence has continued unabated  particularly in Lebanon. Ghana has over the years been involved in United Nations efforts to help the Government of Lebanon to restore normality to the area. It is our hope that the Government of Lebanon will be successful in this uphill task. Meanwhile  we appeal to all the factions and countries involved to assist in bringing peace to Lebanon.The situation in Lebanon is basically a reflection of the continuing problem of a homeland for the Palestinians. Peace in the Middle East will continue to elude us for as long as justice is denied the Palestinian people. Their aspirations can never be suppressed by force of arms. It is our view that all parties  including the Palestinians  under Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leadership  should participate in an international conference called for the purpose of settling the Middle East problem. We call once again upon Israel and its supporters to listen to reason.Ghana is concerned about the continued stalemate in the Cyprus situation and pledges its support for the Secretary-General's efforts to resolve the conflict. We believe in a unified and independent Cyprus  free from external interference  and the resolution of inter-communal conflict through peaceful dialogue.I now turn to the regrettable war between Iran and Iraq. This war  which was occasioned by serious political and strategic miscalculations  is causing enormous human and material losses and has involved the use of chemical weapons and attacks on merchant shipping  in flagrant violation of international law.Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  unanimously adopted last July  may not have met all the concerns of the parties  but it provides a basis for continuing the search for peace. We appeal to both sides to give the provisions of the resolution a trial. We also urge all Member States  particularly the major Powers  to refrain from provocation and the threat of aggression  which would aggravate tension in the area.The situation in Central America  particularly the attempt to subvert the Nicaraguan revolution  continues to cause concern to the Government of Ghana. One would have thought that a region afflicted with serious economic problems would be left free to pursue development and the welfare of its people. Regrettably  the region has had to ward off constant interference in its affairs in a manner that leads one to ask whether the principles enunciated in the Charter  particularly those relating to non-interference in the internal affairs of States  have lost their meaning. Again  in a constructive spirit  we say to our American friends that financial logistical support for the rebels  popularly referred to as contras  is ill-advised. That action  taken together with the covert assistance being channelled to the Savimbi bandits  poses a serious threat to the independence and territorial integrity of the countries of the third world. It is a new dimension in the attempt to undermine the right of the peoples of the third world to self-determination. Happily  there is hope that the countries of Central America are waking up to the need to take their destiny into their own hands and to avoid manipulation by external forces.Ghana endorses the Guatemala agreement as the most enlightened development of late  we appeal to all parties to enter into serious dialogue within the framework of that agreement to establish peace.Ghana's attachment to the principle of self-determination compels us to maintain an objective stance on the conflicts in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. We note with satisfaction that the ongoing mediation efforts by the Secretary-General's representative have resulted in a considerable narrowing of positions on the timing of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. It is our hope that the current momentum will not be lost and that intensive efforts will continue to arrive at an acceptable timetable. We also hope that the call for reconciliation announced by the Afghan authorities to encourage the return of refugees  to participate in the reconstruction of their country will be taken up by the opposition and that the supplying of weapons to the rebels will accordingly cease. Similar developments in Kampuchea would augur well for peace in that country  we appeal again to the parties involved in these conflicts to resort to the peaceful settlement of disputes. The same attachment to the principle of self-determination compels Ghana to denounce the recent plebiscite held by the Government of France in New Caledonia. The result cannot be regarded as truly representative of the wishes of the people· The regrettable events that preceded the plebiscite  the refusal by France to involve the United Nations in the event  the outright condemnation of the process by neighbouring countries  the alleged participation of residents whose commitment to permanent domicile in the Territory is questionable and  above all  the non-participation of the indigenous Melanesian population raise serious questions about the legitimacy of the outcome. We urge the Government of Prance to appreciate the fact that a peaceful solution  perceived by the international community as reflecting the wishes of the people of the Territory  is possible only within the framework of the United Nations and in accordance with the established guidelines and practices of the Organization·We also believe that the problem of Korea should no longer be considered a peripheral issue· It is a problem that should be resolved through peaceful dialogue by the Koreans themselves  without outside interference· We are happy to note that some encouraging steps have been taken in this direction and we hope the two Koreas will adopt a flexible attitude to ensure the reunification of their motherland.I turn to arms control and disarmament  which are more topical than ever as a result of the conclusions just reached by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. Expenditures on the acquisition of arms have reached staggering levels. The spectre of nuclear annihilation hangs over our heads. The enormous resources now devoted to arms production could be used to narrow the gap between the affluent and the poor. The Final Document adopted a fortnight ago  shows us the way and therefore deserves the support of all nations.In this regard  it is gratifying to note that an agreement between the United States and the USSR on the elimination of shorter- and medium-range nuclear missiles is within reach and that progress on other fronts seems likely. This is a great leap forward on the road to the achievement of one of the fundamental objectives of the United Nations - that is  a world without war.The fiscal problems of the United Nations remain unresolved. This is surprising in view of the assurances given by several delegations following the unanimous adoption of a series of recommendations for administrative and financial reform of the Organization on the basis of the report of the Group of 18. That unanimous resolution was the result of intensive negotiations. It is even more regrettable since even before the adoption of the resolution the Secretary-General put into effect a package of measures to confirm his commitment to reform.As we stated last year  the financial problems of the United Nations are politically motivated and directed at the weakening of multilateral co-operation  merely because some Member States are unable to manipulate the Organization in their own ideological interests. We appeal to those who for one reason or another are still withholding funds from the Organization to reappraise their positions. The United Nations - and  indeed  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and all the other affiliates of the Organization for that matter - does not claim perfection. But the answer  in our view  is to seek reform of these agencies  not to undermine their existence. We once again call upon all Member States  especially the founding and influential Members of the United Nations  to respect their pledges to uphold the principles of the Charter. In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm my Government's commitment to the United Nations system and its ideals. We in Ghana continue to view the United Nations a unique experiment in human co-operation. We must secure its future."
"54",2646,"GIN",42,1987,"﻿It is a great honour and a source of legitimate pride to address the Assembly today on behalf of the Military Council of National Reconstruction and the Government of the Republic of Guinea  led by His Excellency General Lansana Conte  out of a political determination to provide it with my country's modest contribution to the finding of solutions to the many problems of concern to our peoples and States.Before discussing the burning issues of the day  Sir  I should like  to discharge a pleasant duty  that of congratulating you very sincerely on behalf of my delegation on your outstanding election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that your skills as an experienced diplomat coupled with your authority and impartiality will guarantee the success we expect of this session of the General Assembly I should like also to thank your predecessor  the representative of Bangladesh  His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  for the outstanding way in which he conducted the work of the last session of the General Assembly.How could I fail to convey to Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar the profound gratitude of my people for the tireless efforts he constantly exerts to bring about a climate of peace  security and prosperity among all nations in an international situation that is so confused and precarious.The Secretary-General's report to the General Assembly rightly stresses that the interdependence of all States forces them to exercise greater co-operation within strengthened multilateralism; it is through this co-operation  for which each State is responsible  that the ideals of the Organization may be achieved. I am convinced that the goals of this co-operation can be achieved only by strengthening the United Nations  the primary instrument for the establishment and maintenance of a climate of confidence and understanding among all States and a powerful tool at the service of peace and development.As we meet once again in this Assembly to assess  as we traditionally do  the work of our Organization  we must say that since the last session the world has remained beset by many areas of tension. International relations  both political and economic  have continued to worsen  and the victims of this situation are  unfortunately  the third world countries - the weakest  most vulnerable entities.The dramatic and sometimes tragic events of recent months  which we have witnessed powerless to do anything  must make us aware that ours is an interdependent world. We see the extent to which conflicts and tensions may impact on general security  and we increasingly appreciate the links between the economies of various regions. That is why my country is committed to the idea of establishing a mote just  more equitable international order.The many pockets of tension throughout our world continue to be of concern to my country. Among the major problems of our Organization there is the heart-rending situation prevailing in South Africa  where each day the anachronistic racist regime of Pretoria steps up its obstinate determination to perpetuate injustice  misery and suffering of the black majority  which it has deprived of its basic eights  is there any greater challenge to the international community than the pseudo-elections in which only whites may participate  the total gagging of the South African media and the absurd maintenance of a state of emergency? Truly  the supporters of apartheid continue to flout the universal conscience through the inhumanity of their domestic policies and the incessant acts of aggression they perpetuate against the front-line countries and neighbouring States.Given the resurgence of acts of State terrorism  a new attitude is necessary  one requiring our unswerving commitment. That is why the Republic of Guinea adds its voice to those of all justice- and freedom-loving States calling for increased assistance in various forms for the victims of apartheid to enable them to deal with the crimes  the destabilizing actions  of the racist Pretoria regime. We welcome here the bold decisions taken on behalf of Africa at the recent summit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa on the situation in that region. Strict implementation of those measures will certainly help to eliminate apartheid and to bring about the triumph of right and justice  resolutely defended by the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)  the national liberation movements  which my country firmly supports.With regard to illegally-occupied Namibia  there still continue dilatory manoeuvres to sabotage implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). With regard to its neighbours  South Africa continues its policy of aggression  destabilization and intimidation. Given the horrendous cycle of violence that has for some time marked the situation in that part of Africa  it is time to go beyond mere condemnation. The minority Pretoria regime has proved to all peoples and Governments of goodwill how bigoted and intransigent it is  and how it totally disregards international law and universal ethics. More effective means of exerting pressure must be adopted to support the struggle of the oppressed peoples of South Africa and Namibia as well as the front-line States. The immediate effective implementation of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter Vii of the Charter will certainly make it possible to force the South African regime to abide by the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations  grant independence to Namibia and promote the advent in South Africa of a democratic multiracial society in which freedom  equality and the dignity of all are guaranteed.Western Sahara is also a source of concern and we are optimistic that the parties to the conflict will proceed to a cease-fire  in keeping with the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations  a prerequisite for the free self-determination of the Sahraoui people. In this respect  a well-deserved tribute should be paid to the Secretary-General for his discreet but effective efforts to find ways and means to prevail upon the protagonists to show the flexibility necessary to lead to an appropriate and lasting solution to the crisis. With regard to Chad  my delegation takes this opportunity to make an urgent appeal to the sons of that country  which has been drenched in blood by many years of fratricidal war  to complete the work of reconciliation. We call upon Libya and Chad to create the conditions for the speedy establishment of a climate of peace and brotherly co-operation in the region.There have not yet been any positive developments regarding the conflict in the Horn of Africa despite many attempts at mediation. Dialogue should be continued to dispel the dangers that still threaten relations between the countries o£ the subregion.The alarming situation in the Middle East  which gets worse every day  and the potential danger of a flare-up of the conflicts underscore the urgent need for the international community to proceed to a comprehensive  effective settlement of this Question  in this connection  the proposal to convene an international conference on peace in the Middle East  under United Nations auspices and with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  should be encouraged.Moreover  it is clear that it is more necessary than ever to find a negotiated solution to the distressing conflict between Iran and Iraq  which is becoming more alarming every day with the escalation of violence  death and desolation. Unless there is the common and persistent will to end this devastating war  the security of the entire Gulf will be dangerously compromised  and with it an entire system of values to which we remain deeply committed. That is why the efforts of the United Nations  through its Secretary-General  should be pursued and supported with a view to ensuring the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as a first step in the search for a just solution to this problem.The initiatives taken by the Secretary-General in the efforts to find a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan must be encouraged and continued with a view to promoting a political solution to the conflict  while respecting the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Afghan people and its right to determine its own future without foreign interference.Regarding the Korean question  only the peaceful reunification of the country  without foreign interference  and the denuclearisation of the peninsula can remove the threat of war and overcome the obstacles blocking the way to the unity of the Korean nation.The complete withdrawal of the foreign troops stationed in Kampuchea is also necessary. The return to a free  democratic  non-aligned Kampuchea is a sure guarantee of the defusing of the situation in South-East Asia and the advent of an era of peace and security. The development of the crisis throughout Central America also gives rise to great apprehension. We welcome the commitments made at the recent meeting in Guatemala of the principal leaders of the region and have great hopes that they will be respected by all the parties and will contribute to a relaxation of the tension in the region and to the establishment of a climate of confidence and good-neighbourliness  which would be an expression of the determination to safeguard the democratic principles and sovereignty of all the States of the region.We take this opportunity to express from this rostrum our deep appreciation of the remarkable efforts made by the Contadora Group to transform this part of the American continent into a zone of peace and co-operation.To these conflict situations we must add other challenges which  unfortunately  do not contribute to the establishment of a climate favourable to international peace and security. Among these challenges is the serious  profound and prolonged crisis affecting the world economy in general and the economies of the third-world countries in particular.Never has the economic situation of the developing countries been more unfavourable. Furthermore  the situation of the African countries is steadily worsening under the combined impact of internal and external factors. Indeed  their economies are being hard hit by the consequences of the worsening of terms of trade  the enormous fluctuations in exchange rates  the increase in interest rates and the flight of capital. Protectionist barriers are blocking their exports  thus causing a fall in the cash flow and reducing their ability to honour their commitments to creditors.With regard to the African continent  the constant deterioration in the terms of trade caused a fall of almost $19 billion in their 1986 export receipts  whereas coat of the debt servicing approached $200 billion for the sane year. To this must be added persistent drought and other natural disasters.It is quite clear that the effort necessary to restore the economy must be made above all by the third-world countries. They are fully aware of this and have  for the most part  undertaken courageous reforms to revitalize their economies. But if these efforts are not followed by a substantial financial input  coupled with a rational understanding of the debt problem  it goes without saying that the sacrifices made will be without effect in the long terra and will result only in unfulfilled hopes. Indeed  without this complementary outside support  it would be pointless to undertake the various projects and programmes of development conceived within the framework of the structural adjustments for the purpose of banishing the spectre of hunger and poverty.Therefore the problem is both political and financial  because the present state of international economic relations  which affect the lives of millions of human beings hardly gives cause for optimism.It is hardly necessary to recall that the negative trends in the world economy will be eliminated only on the basis of a co-ordinated  realistic approach  without selfishness and or narrowness. The North-South dialogue and South-South co-operation provide the appropriate framework for the establishment of greater international economic justice.Peace  security and development  which are indissolubly linked  occupy a central place among the concerns of our time  because they are indispensable factors in the general progress of mankind. In assessing the work done by our Organization in this vital sector we note with regret the absence of significant results in the implementation of many agreements and resolutions.The escalation of the arms race and the exacerbation of hotbeds of tension  abetted by the will to dominate shown by certain major Powers  are creating a true war psychosis among the peoples and imperilling their sovereignty and survival. That is why we welcome and encourage the disarmament negotiations undertaken by the two super-Powers  in the firm hope that they will gradually achieve the complete and absolute denuclearisation of our planet.As was so rightly emphasized by the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  the implementation of these two processes  which are distinct  yet at the same time linked  will create favourable conditions for the progress and prosperity of peoples. Meanwhile  thanks to scientific and technological achievements. Immense resources are wasted in the arms race  while  paradoxically  millions of people are languishing in poverty and suffering from illiteracy  hunger and disease. However  with general and complete disarmament  part of the resources freed could be designated for the purpose of the economic and social development of third-world countries.That is why my delegation is convinced that lasting peace can be achieved only when there is a reduction in the gap between rich nations and poor nations. Thus  all of us without exception  faced with the threat of a nuclear apocalypse and with urgent economic needs  must work together to lay the foundations for a total peace and security  which are pre-conditions of progress and understanding among peoples. Finally  I express the hope that our work will be crowned with success; I am convinced that all nations will ensure scrupulous respect for the principles of the Charter and work untiringly towards the realization of its noble goals of peace  justice and progress.Such an undertaking will demonstrate that we are substituting love for hate and that we are abandoning the perilous path of unreasonableness for clear thinking  and the adolescent anger of the past for a frank and fruitful dialogue.Moreover  we shall thereby have shown our sincere will to look resolutely  all of us together  to a future built on hope and serenity."
"55",2685,"GMB",42,1987,"﻿Allow me  first of all  to extend to you. Sir  my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. My delegation is confident that as a statesman of distinction with well-known qualities of leadership you will guide our deliberations during this session to a successful conclusion. We are confident that this session will continue the good work and even accelerate the momentum and progress generated by the forty-first session.Kindly permit me also to extend a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  for the efficient and dignified manner in which he presided over the forty-first session - a session that will no doubt be remembered as one of the most crucial of this body.I should like  finally  to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his invaluable service to this Organization and his commitment to the peace and security of the world  and the laudable efforts he continues to exert in promoting good will and understanding among all nations.We find ourselves in a momentous period in the history of mankind. The dangers and challenges facing nations  individually and collectively  have been unprecedented in the last quarter in this century. Many of our countries are facing an increasingly critical economic situation as the gap between developed and developing countries continues to widen. Similarly  conflicts  disputes and a general state of instability continue to persist in many parts of the globe. We in the Gambia view these negative trends and developments as seriously endangering international peace and security.Only two years ago  amid the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the President of the Republic of the Gambia  His Excellency Alhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara  unequivocally reminded us from this very rostrum that  despite the significant achievements of the United Nations in numerous fields of human endeavours  the commemoration was taking place against a background of continuing tragedies in the vast majority of developing countries. Although important strides have been made over the past two years  poverty  hunger  all forms of social injustice and wars continue to threaten the survival of millions of people around the world.It is against this background that I now wish to examine  briefly  some of the economic and political issues which ought to preoccupy the attention of every delegation in this Assembly. I am of course mindful of the fact that most of the speakers who preceded me have brilliantly made detailed analyses of these issues. I shall therefore confine myself to those which need to be constantly emphasized.My delegation notes with regret that the economic situation facing developing countries continues to deteriorate. The difficulties in implementing our development policies  individually and collectively  have been compounded by the continuing bleak international economic climate. This unfavourable climate is brought about by the sharp decline in the terms of trade and high interest rates together with the shortening of maturities and an increasingly heavy debt-servicing burden exacerbated by the sharp decline in the price of primary commodities. The economies of developing countries in general have continued to show negative signs of growth and  in spite of painful sacrifices made in recent years  the per capita Incomes in these countries continue to decline.Underlying these trends is the evidence of the severe strain imposed by the global recession at the turn of the decade. There has also been a significant slow-down of growth in the world economy  with far-reaching consequences on international trade. In the developing countries  incentives for investment and production have sharply eroded in the wake of declining commodity prices and increased protectionism. Faced with these overwhelming odds  developing countries have suffered a serious reversal in their development efforts due to substantial loss of export earnings and mounting indebtedness. My delegation therefore firmly believes that there is need for economic preventive medication and a reassessment of the world economic situation  as it is evident that the present economic crisis works manifest injustice on all developing nations.It will be recalled that the threat of a universal economic catastrophe has compelled both developed and developing countries to focus more attention on the need for close co-operation. Notwithstanding this spontaneous awareness of concerted international action to resolve contemporary global economic problems  the necessary political will is regrettably still far from adequate. Yet the worsening economic crisis  which stems from the persistent denial of the developed countries to satisfy the basic needs of the majority of mankind  constitutes the greatest threat to world peace and security. While we recognize that mankind has the vision and capacity to guarantee the maintenance of world peace and the socio-economic development of all nations  we are more than convinced that narrow self-interest are the main stumbling-block to the realization of these global objectives.It is gratifying to note  however  that at the level of the African continent we have with renewed commitment embarked upon a programme of action for the dual purpose of survival and development. I am referring to the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at the special session on Africa in May of last year.Mindful of the fact that the socio-economic progress of our continent is primarily our own responsibility  we in the Gambia  like other countries in the developing world  have been pursuing an economic recovery programme. In response to the deteriorating economic situation  in mid-1985 the Government of the Gambia adopted a comprehensive economic recovery programme aimed at laying the basis for sustained economic growth while restoring domestic and external financial equilibrium.The programme aims specifically at achieving an annual growth rate of real domestic product of 3.3 per cent during the period 1986/87-1988/89  while reducing the inflation rate from 35 per cent  on an annual basis  in 1985/86 to below 10 per cent in 1988/89.In the external sector  the programme's main objectives were to build up official foreign exchange reserves  reduce the large stock of external-payment arrears  normalize relations with creditors through rescheduling agreements and the timely servicing of non-schedulable obligations.In pursuit of those objectives  the Government embarked on a strategy aimed both at reducing domestic absorption and promoting growth in output. To curtail inflationary pressures and restore external payments balance  the strategy emphasizes prudent demand management through appropriate fiscal  monetary  exchange-rate  pricing and external-debt policies. To develop the productive sectors  the economic recovery programme aims at promoting private initiative through the provision of appropriate price and other incentives  primarily in agriculture  manufacturing and fisheries. To achieve greater efficiency in public-sector operations  the programme calls for significant reductions in government employment  a reorganization of the civil service  rationalization and divestiture of major public enterprises  and more stringent project selection to improve the productivity of the public sector.Significant progress has been made in implementing the programme  and the Gambia economic and financial performance to date has exceeded the programme's objective in many respects. Real growth in the gross domestic product in 1986/87 is estimated at 6 per cent  compared with the programme target of 3.3 per cent. At the same time  the rate of increase in the consumer price index is about 20 per cent  from 70 per cent in 1985/86. In 1986/87  the external current account  excluding official transfers  widened to about 40 million special drawing rights (SDR) - 34 per cent of the gross domestic product - or SDR 5 million above the programme target. The overall balance of payments  excluding exceptional financing  for which a deficit of SDR 20.4 million was forecast  was virtually in balance. The build-up in gross official foreign reserves plus the reduction in external payments arrears amounted to about SDR 35 million  compared with the initial programme objective of SDR 5.5 million.I must confess that it has been a very painful process  in view of the magnitude of the sacrifices made by our people  but we are also consoled by the fact that the results obtained so far have been encouraging.It is a matter of great concern that  despite the efforts being made by our countries  the international community has not been forthcoming in providing increased flow of official development assistance to the continent and has not adequately addressed the urgent need to solve the menacing problem of Africa's indebtedness.  Our efforts to stimulate economic growth and raise the living standards of our peoples are being suffocated by the weight of debt-service obligations. Unless the devastating debt burden and the continued fall in international commodity prices be given urgent attention by the international community  our efforts to revive nr fragile economies will be futile.The external debt crisis has already reached alarming proportions and  as is recognized in General Assembly resolution 41/202  adopted by consensus at the forty-first session  an integrated approach involving creditor and debtor nations  multilateral financial institutions and international private banks is necessary if durable solutions to the debt problem are to be found. The need for an international conference to tackle this problem is becoming even more pressing. The hard fact is that  although debtor countries are willing to repay their debts  they are simply unable to do so in the present economic climate. We therefore urge the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly to take a decision to convene such a conference without any further delay.At this juncture I should like to commend the gestures of some countries like Canada  Great Britain  the Scandinavian countries and the Federal Republic of Germany for having decided to write off the debts of some developing countries or convert loans to grants. I appeal to the entire international donor community to focus greater attention on Africa's indebtedness and help in alleviating this terrible scourge with a view to responding more favourably to our recovery efforts and the plight of our peoples  who are yearning for a better life.Since my country falls within the Sahelian zone  which for more than a decade has been suffering from severe drought  I would be failing in my duty if I did not make even a passing but important observation on the need to address the issues of food security  drought control and desertification  as well as water-resources development and management. All those issues are crucial to our recovery efforts. My delegation strongly believes that if drought-stricken countries do not succeed in effectively addressing those problems - of coarse  with the full support of the international community - our objectives of increasing agricultural production and encouraging self-sufficiency in food for the total well-being of our people will elude us.My delegation looks forward with great anticipation to the new round of multilateral trade negotiations agreed upon at Punta del Este  Uruguay  just a year ago. We hope the new round will bring about a significant reversal of present trends in international trade. My delegation is also gratified by the outcome of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the adoption of a Final Act which represents a significant commitment by the international community to address the most critical areas of multilateral trade in the light of the special needs of the least developed countries in Africa.We take note with a large measure of encouragement of the fact that the special needs of African countries have become a major focus of attention at the annual meetings of seven industrialized nations. The recent consensus reached at Venice on Africa's indebtedness and on the need for a substantial increase in the special facility for Africa is most reassuring. It is a source of great hope and encouragement also that the eighth replenishment of the International Development Association has been accorded overwhelming support.We are extremely happy to note that in his statement during the recent annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the World Bank  held in Washington  the Right honourable Nigel Lawson  Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom  stressed the point that special action was required to help the very poorest and most heavily indebted countries  particularly those of sub-Saharan Africa. We hope that this important and timely proposal will be pursued with vigour and a sense of urgency with a view to its adoption by the international donor community. There is no doubt that sustained economic growth and social progress can be achieved in international relations only if everyone recognizes that our mutual interdependence makes it imperative that all nations large and small be able to participate fully in international trade and exchanges  with an underlying commitment to social justice and higher living standards.While economic questions continue to attract the attention of the vast majority of nations  serious political problems in many parts of the globe still threaten world peace and security. Among these none is more explosive than the issue of apartheid South Africa.Apartheid is a system we all condemn  with total agreement that it should disappear; yet some of us are not merely concerned  but disturbed  that there is still disagreement as regards the adoption of a common approach to the eradication of apartheid. While we continue to have endless debates  the black majority of South Africa remains trapped in the shadow of the most brutal repression and persecution carried out by the Pretoria regime in blatant disregard of the most fundamental values and ideals on which this Organization was founded. The international community has failed to reach consensus on the comprehensive and far-reaching measures necessary to bring apartheid to an end. But the heroic masses have remained resolute in their struggle to dismantle apartheid  under the dynamic leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)  even in the face of arbitrary arrests  imprisonment without trial and indiscriminate killing of victims including religious leaders  women and children.My Government strongly and unequivocally condemns the senseless massacre and the continued denial of fundamental freedoms. My delegation will hasten to participate in any substantive discussions and concerted international action to bring apartheid to its inevitable end. In the meantime  we are of the view that the only sensible means left to deal with apartheid South Africa is the imposition of mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.We are also of the opinion that in order to create an atmosphere conducive to peaceful dialogue. Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners languishing in South African gaols must be released immediately and unconditionally. My delegation has read with measured care the speech recently delivered in New York by Mr. George Shultz  Secretary of State of the United States  to the Business Council for International understanding· We are of the view that that important statement on the situation in South Africa was positive in both approach and content and that it could therefore form the basis for negotiations among all interested parties in South Africa with the full participation of the ANC and the PAC. I hasten to add that if any proposed solution is to enjoy serious consideration it must have the support of the front-line States and the members of the Security Council.My delegation is saddened too by the situation in neighbouring Namibia  where Pretoria remains intransigent in its defiance of the Security Council. South Africa is clearly on a collision course with disaster  having deliberately frustrated all efforts aimed at a peaceful transition to a multi-racial society. Despite our collective efforts within the framework of the Security Council to exercise authority over the Territory through the adoption of numerous resolutions. South Africa has refused with impunity to obey the Security Council on the question of self-determination and independence for Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). My delegation fully supports the imposition of mandatory sanctions within the framework of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. We are convinced that this is the most viable solution to the Namibian problem.We find it disturbing that South Africa's neighbours  particularly the front-line States  have become hostages to brutal aggression and destabilization by the Pretoria regime. In that regard  my delegation strongly urges the international community to provide those nations the assistance that would guarantee their territorial integrity and independence. The unending saga of the Palestine tragedy touches the hearts of all those who believe in self-determination. My delegation believes that respect for the Palestinian quest for self-determination is a necessary pre-condition for the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. We consider the situation in the occupied Arab territories both appalling and unacceptable. It is therefore in this spirit that we consider that the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under United Nations auspices would be an important step in the search for a lasting settlement of this grave human tragedy. Such a conference can be successful only if the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) participates fully and on an equal footing with the other parties to the conflict.The situation in Lebanon is another unfolding tragedy of immeasurable proportions  and one which violates all established international norms. We believe that the time has come for the people of Lebanon to live up to their national aspiration to sovereignty and territorial integrity. To this end  we call for the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory and demand respect for the territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon.The Gulf war between Iran and Iraq continues to be a major concern of my Government - and indeed of my President  Alhaji Sir Oawda Jawara - as the state of hostilities between the two sides drags into its eighth year and assumes catastrophic new dimensions. As Chairman of the Peace Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the President of the Gambia has  since 1984  been actively engaged in this formidable process of mediation. Recent developments in the region  however  have caused dismay and anxiety in the entire Islamic Ummah  while further seriously endangering world peace and security. We therefore welcome and applaud ongoing initiatives by the Secretary-General to bring that human tragedy to an early settlement. With regard to the situation in South-East Asia  my Government fully supports the efforts being made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  and we maintain the view that the military occupation of Kampuchea constitutes a violation of the fundamental principles of international law embodied in the Charter. The occupation also violates the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and the rights of the Kampuchean peoples to self-determination. The youth of that country have lived the prime of their lives under the spectre of war and repression  and should be allowed the opportunity to determine their own destiny.It is regrettable that after eight years of foreign domination  and in spite of the noble efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative  Mr. Cordovez  a political settlement in Afghanistan has still not been achieved. My delegation is of the view that the only sure way of achieving a quick and amicable solution of the Afghan problem is by the unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops  based on the decision of this Assembly. We therefore urge those responsible for the continuation of hostilities to recognize the rights of the Afghans to exercise self-determination. The problem of Afghanistan is one of foreign occupation  and once the withdrawal of foreign troops is achieved the Afghan people will quickly solve their internal problems  as history has proved time and time again.My delegation would like to place on record our deep appreciation to the Government of Pakistan for its constructive participation in the Geneva proximity talks and the attention given to the millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.The unification of Korea  and in the mean time the admission of both North and South Korea to the United Nations  is of particular interest to my delegation. We are convinced that dialogue between the two sides with an underlying commitment to the mutual interest of them both will help reduce tension and ultimately bring —to resolution of the problem. Although it was as long ago as 1948 that the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  almost 40 years later the civil  political  economic and cultural rights of millions of people around the world continue to be denied them. We in the Gambia are of the view that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Commission on Human and People's Rights  which was recently put in place by the summit of African Heads of State and Government  should be an adequate representation of the conscience of all nations. Our responsibilities in the field of human rights transcend the narrow limits of economic self-interest and political expediency. Our task is to uphold and promote the rights of peoples wherever they may be violated  threatened or otherwise compromised.My delegation is of the strong opinion that the time has now come to put an end to the denials of life and liberty and to the inhuman suffering which is the lot of millions of innocent human beings all over the world. We in the Gambia  under the leadership of President Alhaji Sic Dawda Kairaba Jawara  are firmly committed to the protection of and respect for human rights. This is a commitment which is built upon the solid foundation of our domestic laws and which is a major determinant of our foreign policy.Respect for fundamental human rights  the corner-stone of Gambian democracy  is also the catalyst of our socio-economic development  for we firmly believe that only in an atmosphere of freedom and security can the individual effectively contribute to the collective good of all. Indeed  the struggle against colonialism  oppression and racism is yet another attempt to raise the level of human dignity.This is the backdrop against which the forty-second session of the General Assembly is being held. It is a period of unprecedented economic uncertainty  in which the gap between rich and poor continues to widen; it is a time of political crises in many parts of the world  when the peace  however fragile  that has prevailed since the founding of the United Nations is seriously threatened. But there is some degree of hope of overcoming these difficulties  since those who genuinely desire peace outnumber the forces of evil. And  because of our collective desire to seek peaceful solutions to the global problems we face  we still have the United Nations  whose machinery can be strengthened and better used  together with our regional organizations  inspired by the quest for development and peace  to translate ideas into action for the common good of humanity. However  I hasten to add that the United Nations can have little concrete impact so long as some members of the international community continue to view the abominable global problems in the narrow perspective of economic  political or strategic self-interest."
"56",2725,"GNB",42,1987,"﻿It is a great honour for me to speak in this Assembly on behalf of my country  the Republic of Guinea-Bissau Sir  the delegation of Guinea-Bissau  which is familiar with your many qualities and talents  takes special pleasure in congratulating you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. This is particularly the case because your country  the German Democratic Republic  with which Guinea-Bissau enjoys relations of friendship and co-operation  has always made a positive contribution to the strengthening and consolidation of the role of the Organization  You may rest assured  therefore  that our delegation will not spare its efforts to co-operate with you. I should also like to extend to your predecessor  Mr. Choudhury  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  my country's gratitude for his distinguished services to the international community during his term of office.On behalf of the Government of Guinea-Bissau  I should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Perez de Cuellar and to express to him our gratitude for his vigorous and tireless work at the head of the Organization. Since his election six years ago the Secretary-General has accustomed us to concrete  courageous and intelligent deeds. Our delegation would like to extend to him once again its support in the restructuring of the Secretariat with a view to strengthening the Organization's ability better to respond to the problems facing it.In this connection  I welcome the appointment of Ambassador Reed as Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs  and I should like to express to him once again my feelings of friendship and to extend to him my warm wishes for success.The agreement in principle with regard to the elimination of intermediate-range missiles reached by the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  as well as the announcement of an autumn summit meeting  have raised fresh hopes within the international community.All of us regard this as the fruit of an earnest desire on the part of the super-Powers to pursue their negotiations successfully and to find grounds therein to encourage them to continue their efforts to arrive at a better understanding and enable them  sooner rather than later  to engage in additional  concrete  complementary and necessary actions to achieve general and complete disarmament. Indeed  disarmament remains the paramount objective  an absolute imperative towards which all States  large  medium-sized or small  must strive with conviction and determination. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which concluded its work here only a few weeks ago  highlighted the advantages of more rational utilization of the planet's resources. Indeed  while it is true that every State has the right to take the measures needed to ensure its own defence  nothing can justify over-armament  the cost of which is matched only by its absurdity. In a world in which the interdependence of peoples is a tangible reality and we all feel both its good and its ill effects  it would be wrong  even harmful  for any country  large or small  to disregard the existence and conditions of life of other peoples  because security is a collective concept which embraces both individual and collective responsibilities.Most of the problems facing mankind stem from existing disparities  the injustice that still prevails in the world  the intolerance regarding certain cultures and religious beliefs and the failure to respect individual and collective freedoms in many countries.Today we can only watch helplessly the decline in moral values  which are  however  the very basis of all human society. The use of drugs by a growing number of young people is one of the most tragic aspects of this. My country welcomes the results of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  held recently in Vienna  and is determined to play its part in the great international offensive against that scourge.Many countries are now facing such difficulties that their peoples have to struggle furiously simply to survive. The adoption by the Governments concerned of sometimes draconian measures to contain and control the situation has not yet yielded the desired improvements. The world economy continues to be characterized by an unprecedented structural crisis  with rare exceptions  growth has remained slow in developing countries  where the volume of exports remains limited if indeed it has not fallen dramatically.Thus  in Africa  a continent assailed by drought and prey to other natural calamities as unforeseeable as they are disastrous  tremendous efforts have been made to improve the standard of living of the peoples. Important reforms have been undertaken in most African States  including Guinea-Bissau  where vast restructuring has been completed with a view to stabilizing the macro-economic environment. A programme of structural adjustment is under way which embraces  among other things  trade reforms to balance incentives in favour of exports  the adoption of a more realistic rate of exchange and appropriate measures to reduce the budget deficit.But all these reforms  the success of which requires additional sacrifices on the part of our peoples  may be in vain if the international economic situation does not change. The developing countries are now facing the progressive decline in the prices of commodities and the rise of protectionism. This situation has caused them considerable losses and seriously jeopardizes their development efforts. If international trade prospects do not improve  stagnation  if not actual economic decline  is liable to ensue in those countries. We must therefore prevent the multilateral trade system from continuing to decline. But existing imbalances can be eliminated only if current financial flows are reversed to take into account the real ability of developing countries to face the difficult problem of indebtedness.The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) enabled the international community to make progress on a number of the items that we have mentioned. The final Act of that Conference  which was adopted by consensus  takes into account both the complexity of the debt crisis and the need for the reforms undertaken by debtor countries to be accompanied by an additional input of financial resources on liberal terms. The proposals made by the African Governors at the annual assembly of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  which concluded its work last week in Washington  stem from the same analysis and are designed to meet the same concerns.As economic theory and the facts show  merely balancing the books does not necessarily mean progress in terms of development. The social and cultural aspect of development must be at the very centre of our concerns  dominate our analyses and underlie the adoption of appropriate measures to promote the progress of our peoples. The interdependence of various world problems from the economic and political standpoint make it incumbent upon us to avoid confrontation and seek harmony through dialogue and common endeavour.Our delegation shares the concern expressed by the Secretary-General in his masterly report and endorses his conclusions as to the grave risks inherent in the current conflicts.All the countries represented recognize that there has been no substantial progress towards solving many of the problems affecting the international community. Indeed  in spite of declarations of intent and the many protestations of good faith  the international situation remains precarious and millions of human beings throughout the world continue to be victims of the horrors of war and repression.In southern Africa  the apartheid regime persists in its policy of domination and racial discrimination  in spite of universal condemnation. The majority of the South African people remain victims of an abominable political system and are exiles in their own country  where the right to exist and live in full dignity is denied them. The racist regime of South Africa has become a master of the art of evasiveness and provocation and is stepping up its delaying tactics and acts of intimidation against its neighbours to delay the independence of Namibia. It has resorted to a whole range of subterfuges and promulgated a series of repressive laws with the cynical idea of breaking the ranks of the South African militants and weakening their liberation movement. The South African people who continue to languish in the apartheid gaols expect practical action from the international community that will bring about the necessary changes more rapidly. They demand the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners  and in particular Nelson Mandela.There are countries among us that have the necessary political power  the essential economic and cultural influence and the clear historical moral obligation to play without further delay the role incumbent upon them to achieve the desired end. My country urges them to do this and follows with interest the positive developments under way in some of those countries.Apartheid must be combated by all. On this question more than on any other  the international community must unite  organize and take action to wipe that odious system from the face of the earth.The southern African liberation movements must be supported and encouraged in their legitimate struggle  as must the front-line countries  Angola and Mozambique in particular  which are the victims of continuous acts of aggression and destabilization by South Africa. The African National Congress (ANC) has demonstrated to those that might still have doubts its maturity and political intentions and that it is led by responsible people who are aware of and anxious to preserve the equality in law of all South Africans without distinction. The independence of Namibia can be brought about within the desired time-frame only if the necessary pressures are exerted on South Africa and it' all Member States give the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) the constant  resolute support merited by the justice of its cause.Guinea-Bissau  faithful to its recent past and to the principles of freedom and democracy  will continue to support actively and in solidarity the struggle of the peoples of southern Africa for their right to dignity. Still in Africa  but closer to Guinea-Bissau  there is the question of Western Sahara and the conflict between Chad and Libya. The persistence of these two crisis situations is a cause of concern to all Africans  who for many years now have spared no effort to bring about peaceful solutions on the basis of the principles in the charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the United Nations Charter and other relevant international juridical instruments.Guinea-Bissau  which has always made dialogue one of the instruments of its foreign policy  will continue to support the efforts of the OAU to bring about a settlement of the conflict between Chad and Libya  two countries which we regard as brothers and friends. As In the past  we shall fully support the joint initiatives of the Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the OAU to organize as soon as possible  on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the two Organizations  a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara.For many years now  we have deplored the persistence of the conflict in the Middle East  the consequences of which are not any longer confined to that region. We therefore believe that the convening of an International conference on the Middle East is necessary and could help to promote the establishment of peace and justice in the area. However  if it is to succeed  that conference must take into account the Interests of all the parties concerned  and in particular  the participation on an equal footing of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole  authentic representative of the Palestinian people.The Middle East conflict has assumed such proportions that it has now engulfed Lebanon  whose very existence Is now threatened. On behalf of my country  I reiterate our support for the Lebanese people in its struggle to defend its Independence  national sovereignty  territorial Integrity and cultural and religious heritage. In spite of the persistent efforts of the international community  the conflict between Iran and Iraq continues to worsen. Several leading personalities  Governments and international organizations  including the organization of the Islamic Conference  have tried in vain to use their good offices to help bring to an end that fratricidal war  which is becoming increasingly internationalised. The Persian Gulf has become a veritable powder keg where any mistake could lead to a conflagration with  to say the least  unforeseeable consequences. Understanding of this fact by the members of the Security Council led to the unanimous adoption of resolution 598 (1987)  which constitutes an important step towards a negotiated solution to the conflict. On behalf of United-Bissau and in a brotherly spirit  I reiterate our appeal to Iran and Iraq to co-operate fully in this endeavour. With regard to Central America  we are encouraged by the positive development of the situation  particularly through the signing of the Guatemala agreement between the Heads of State of the region. This new and important achievement  while confirming the virtues of dialogue inherent in the peoples of Latin America  clearly demonstrates their determination and ability to resolve their problems for themselves. So we must encourage them to persevere in total independence in the wise direction that they have taken  which is in keeping with their aspirations.The right to self-determination is a hallowed principle of our Organization.That is why I invoke it to defend the right of the people of East Timor to live in freedom and in the way it wishes. For more than a decade now it has been denied that right  in the tragic circumstances with which we are all familiar  East Timor cannot and must not be an exception to the cardinal principles laid down in the Charter. The United Nations and  in particular  Portugal  the legal Administering Authority  can and must discharge their responsibilities so as to bring that Territory  in the conditions provided for in the relevant United Nations resolutions  to the full exercise of its right to self-determination and independence.Similarly  we wish to see the Korean people realize by means of constructive dialogue and in full independence its aspiration to reunification of its country. We hope that the two parties concerned will show the political will necessary to achieve this and we encourage them to continue their efforts.In Kampuchea and Afghanistan  the initiatives taken so far have not yet yielded the desired results. We hope that the efforts of the Secretary-General will be met with a sincere desire on the part of the countries of the region to solve their disputes by negotiation. My country will continue to support the efforts of the international community to bring about a solution that takes account of the principles of the Charter and respect the non-aligned status of the two countries and their sovereign right freely to choose their political system and their course of social and economic development.Similarly  we support the efforts of the international community to preserve the independence  national sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Cyprus  where the two communities must be able to live in peace and harmony.The rapid survey that I have just undertaken  although it has taken in many parts of the world  is not exhaustive and the list of questions that I have mentioned is far from complete. Nevertheless  I shall bring my statement to an end.The international political situation remains precarious because little progress has been made towards achieving respect for the right of peoples to live in freedom  with full enjoyment of their civil and political rights. This is particularly true in Namibia and South Africa  where the inhuman apartheid regime persists. In spite of the efforts of the international community and the good offices of the Secretary-General  serious conflicts continue to threaten international peace and security. The war between Iran and Iraq is assuming ever more alarming proportions. In the Middle East the peoples concerns have not yet seen their hopes fulfilled and the prospects of peace are still remote. The questions of Western Sahara  Kampuchea  Afghanistan and Cyprus  among others  remain items on our agenda  no solutions having been found.The world economic situation remains critical and the debt crisis is threatening the development of many countries  particularly in Africa and Latin America.Tensions  conflicts  terrorism  the economic crisis  the moral and political crisis and indebtedness are among the major obstacles to the establishment of world peace and the major challenges facing the international community. Solution of the grave problems facing humanity is in many cases difficult. Many attempts are made to achieve settlement but they are constantly frustrated by misunderstanding and intransigence. As we have said  dialogue and trust among nations must be restored if today we want to succeed where confrontation and distrust caused us to fail yesterday. The peoples of the world are entitled to hope that their dreams will come true and it is the duty of the Governments that we represent here to act to that end.My country  Guinea-Bissau  on the oasis of the fundamental principles which have always guided its non-aligned policy of friendship and co-operation with all States  will do everything in its power to make a positive contribution to the efforts of the international community to restore a climate of peace to the world and to strengthen international co-operation  in the real interests of our respective peoples. Our confidence in a better future remains  none the less  unshakeable  for we continue to believe in the genius of man  a genius which has made it possible to bring about the fantastic progress of the world today and the conquest of new domains. We continue to believe  therefore  in the genius of man and in his capacity to overcome all obstacles facing him  provided the will exists. I believeand I trust that we shall succeed in mustering that will  which is still lacking."
"57",2764,"GNQ",42,1987,"﻿The current session of the General Assembly is taking place two years after our commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  and at a time when the international community continues to face many complex problems  that are the logical consequence of the overlapping of interests in the various issues we must consider in order to realize the principles and provisions of the United Nations Charter.I wish to express our satisfaction at the outstanding election of Ambassador Florin to guide the work of the General Assembly at its forty—second session; we congratulate him warmly. We are certain that his great talent and ability  together with his country's traditions of freedom and co-operation  will help ensure the success of our work.We wish also to convey our congratulations to the other Assembly officers; we hope that their experience and concern will help improve the decisions and resolutions the Assembly is to adopt. I assure them of my delegation's willingness to co-operate fully in the task of furthering our work and achieving tangible results. We appreciate also the intensive work carried out by the President of the Assembly at its forty-first session. His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasneed Choudhury  who  along with all the other officers of the Assembly at that session  earned the respect and admiration of everyone because of their sense of responsibility and dedication.	The number of items on the agenda of this session; the complexity of some of the questions we must deal with? the exacerbation of  or the stagnation in the search for solutions to  some problems whose solution is not merely necessary but imperative - all attest to the need to appeal to the conscience of mankind. So  far from limiting our work to well-intentioned decisions and resolutions  we must move from the bureaucratic phase to the phase of concrete action in conformity with the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations.In nature  the process of evolution involves a certain differentiation depending on the phase in question. If all countries lived in peace and harmony with the same access to development opportunities; if professions of mutual respect lived up to the principle of the sovereign equality of States; if non-interference in the internal affairs of States  the right of every people to choose the form of government most suited to its national interests and other principles were truly reflected in international relations and in peaceful coexistence; if certain States did not exploit their advantageous position compared with other States to place conditions on assistance that might be used for those in need - then we might be able to realize the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations in word and indeed. But an objective assessment of the varied interests that generate the problems facing countries will explain the true situation  and we must strive to bring that situation into conformity with the law. I wish at this stage to convey our warm congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  on the efficient and outstanding manner in which he carries out his great responsibilities on behalf of peace and understanding among peoples. His brilliant career of commitment to the highest guarantees the Organization a promising future.The Secretary-General's extensive report on the work of the Organization sets forth the grave problems of concern to the international community at present. When millions of human beings still struggle to survive and overcome the effects of hunger  misery  poverty  endemic disease  and so forth - in a word  when some are s ill struggling to survive by overcoming the most basic problems of underdevelopment - others more fortunate are worsening the lot of those struggling f r survival by using their surpluses to do things without which the world might be a more peaceful  harmonious and secure place. Equatorial Guinea cannot conceive of the world without this great Organization  the United Nations. Serious problems detract from its credibility and effectiveness  and  if we interpret current phenomena correctly  they are the result of the risks the international community runs when an Organization such as this is undermined  neutralized or immobilized. Here  the will of Members States  large and small  and their ability to settle disputes are being put to the test.In times of tension and crisis  it is necessary to speak unambiguously  dispassionately and objectively; this will inevitably lead us to the conclusion that things cannot continue as they are and that the community of nations must adopt resolute and constructive attitudes in order to give a new direction to international life  one that can be translated into political evolution  economic and social progress and equal opportunities. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea calls for innovation in international life and in inter-State relations  innovation that can resolve the great paradox of the world in which we live; this is an era of contradictions  a time of unprecedented scientific and technological progress  but a time when there is little will to turn it to the benefit of mankind or to satisfy the fundamental desire for the peace  justice and dignity that are among the essential elements of the human condition.It cannot be denied that at its past session the United Nations played a positive role in helping to solve the problems of concern to the international community. In spite of different political orientations and economic systems the interdependence of the world has led various countries to begin to deal by consensus with questions of common interest. Fortunately  some countries  through dialogue  have set an example by settling their disputes by means of peaceful negotiations.As a third-world country the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is concerned at the proliferation of conventional weapons  which unjustifiably diverts resources for the development of peoples  lessening their possibilities of living a life in dignity in keeping with their right to social and economic well-being.In their ongoing negotiations the super-Powers must seek to conclude agreements and to adopt measures aimed at achieving arms limitation. They must seek to achieve that goal not only in order to devote more resources to development but also to put an end to the enormous profits being earned by arms dealers  who do not hesitate to provoke conflicts and disputes between nations and peoples.The military budgets in every country ace steadily growing  in some of them in order to strengthen their domination and hegemony and in others merely in order to survive. However  the ideals of freedom  human rights  healthy coexistence and so on can be implanted and take root in peoples if they are accompanied by appropriate assistance to reduce the trade imbalance that exists between countries  some of which grow wealthier by the day through the impoverishment of others.The continuing arms race accentuates the threat of conflagration  which would  in the worst of cases  lead to nuclear confrontation with disastrous consequences for mankind. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  their possession and use  should be limited in so far as possible and they should  in the best of cases  be completely eliminated and the relevant resources used to improve the social conditions of the most underprivileged. The constant insecurity the world is experiencing at the present time should be the subject of profound reflection in which the great Powers  because of the role they are called upon to play at this time  have a special responsibility.The persistence of many hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world is a great concern to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. It advocates dialogue as the best way to settle differences.In Africa  the border disputes that are setting Libya and Chad against each other have caused great human and material losses  and we appeal to the conscience of the leaders of both countries and those supporting them to impose a cease-fire and to enter into peaceful negotiations leading to respect by each party of the borders inherited from the colonial period  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity and of the United Nations.It is inconceivable that  given the world's current state of development  there should still exist a political regime as arrogant as the one holding sway in South Africa. The people of South Africa are living in their own land without the slightest possibility of being able to enjoy the most fundamental human rights. The South African regime is illegally keeping the Territory of Namibia in a colonial status  despite the relevant resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. The independent States of southern Africa live under the constant threat of destabilization and South Africa's constant violation of their sovereignty.Unless all States Members of the United Nations take appropriate measures to exert their influence to put an end to the heinous regime of apartheid once and for all  to gain respect for the human rights of the suffering South Africans and for the rights and sovereignty of all the countries of the region  to ensure that South African abandons its illegal occupation of Namibia and that the people of that Territory are able to enjoy their inalienable right to freedom and independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)   peace and stability will still be far from being achieved in that region.The intransigence of the minority apartheid regime of South Africa not only poses a threat to peace and stability in that important area of the African continent; its persistence  which creates such violence and suffering  could also unleash irreparable disaster for the entire world. For at the current level of development it represents an affront to mankind and an unspeakable attitude in that prestigious countries with special responsibilities for ensuring respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter  out of economic  strategic or other interests  are supporting the continuation of a regime which  by its very nature  must inevitably disappear.In Western Sahara the population has been afflicted with great human and material losses in recent years. We appreciate the commendable efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and by the Organization of African Unity (OAU); we support the relevant resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations that would enable the Sahraoui people to exercise their right to self-determination. We support the efforts being made in Central America by the leaders of the region to achieve peace and stability there through peaceful means and dialogue. The various initiatives that have recently led to the agreements reached at the summit known as Esquipulas TI  Guatemala  deserve the fullest support and respect. We are sure that their implementation will enable all the countries of the region to live in harmony  that it will strengthen the spirit of solidarity  which is so necessary  and that the respective peoples will be led by regimes that are more interested in their national and political purposes.We trust that reason and the path of dialogue will prevail in solving the dispute over Argentina's claim to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. A solution to the question would not only be welcomed by the international community  but would enhance the prestige and authority of those who have to decide these matters between the parties in conflict.Tension continues in South-East Asia  particularly over the situation in Kampuchea. It is vital that there be a comprehensive political solution  taking into account the great interest of the countries of the region in economic development  reconstruction and peace. The Kampucheans should be able to enjoy the fruits of their own land  benefiting from what nature has given them  without foreign interference.The stagnation in the talks aimed at reducing tension in the Korean peninsula is prejudicing the encouraging atmosphere created when contacts between representatives of North Korea and South Korea gave reason for hope with regard to proposals for the peaceful reunification of the Korean people. The division imposed on the Korean people requires that the leaders of both Governments make efforts to ensure that their proposals for talks be more pragmatic and flexible. That would increase their credibility within the international community  instead of the proposals seeming to be a covert expression of the defence of opposing  foreign interests  which do not take account of the aspirations of the Korean people.We support the principle of the peaceful reunification of Korea  and are confident that when it occurs the international community will welcome its admission to  and participation in  the entire United Nations system.In Afghanistan the people have been suffering for eight long years the effects of a war that should be over by now. The talks on solving the conflict should lead not only to the return of the refugees but also to the participation of all Afghans in the country's political affairs  which in turn demands a wide-ranging reconciliation  without foreign pressure or intervention. Prolongation of the current situation would increase the social  political and economic problems  which have become unbearable for the people concerned. It is therefore necessary to resolve the conflict once and for all in a such way that all parties can be certain there will be an independent  sovereign Afghanistan.In the Middle East the Arab-Israeli conflict has claimed so many victims and caused so much material damage that its continuation is harmful to the aspirations of the peoples of the region. Only a comprehensive solution leading to the establishment of a just and lasting peace satisfactory to all the parties concerned will do. Equatorial Guinea believes that a military solution would give no guarantee of peace and stability in the region. Accordingly  the conflict can be settled only through negotiations  taking into account the rights of all the peoples of the region  including the Palestinians  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).The fratricidal war between Iraq and Iran has been going on for eight long years  causing more than a million casualties and  totally illogical. The persistence of the conflict and the dimensions to which it has grown endanger the region's peace and stability  and it is becoming an international problem. The adoption of stubborn attitudes can in no way solve differences; rather  it exacerbates them. We therefore appeal to the conscience and reason of the leaders of the two countries to impose a cease-fire and pave the way for negotiations through dialogue.The world's economy is today passing through a difficult period  as we know not only from a wide variety of facts and figures  but from the situation as we experience it. It has a particularly severe impact on the less developed countries. With few exceptions  the countries deeply in debt are continuing to record very slow growth. Commodity prices are dropping at a dizzy pace  and there is still no sign of any general improvement coming in the immediate future. However  the national income of the developed countries has increased  owing to the improvement in their terms of trade.The countries less affected by changes in international markets are those with large  diversified economies. They do not include the African countries  whose economic situation is critical. The opening up to the international economy of the African States  which have an un diversified system  has brought us more disadvantages than benefits  particularly in recent years  when the prices of the basic commodities on which our economies largely depend have dropped sharply.Although the authorities in  and leaders of  the world's economic and financial Powers say that the economic situation of Africa south of the Sahara gives cause for concern  and that it is absolutely necessary to increase the volume of real resources to assist those African countries  Τ am sorry to have to say that slowness and hesitation have characterized the response of the donors and creditors on how to solve the problem of the continent's economy recovery. Many African countries have implemented readjustment measures  agreeing to huge  far-reaching sacrifices. However  the international community's reaction has so far been timid.If our economies are to overcome the difficult situation in which they now find themselves  the most important economies must adopt a more positive position. If the problems of the indebtedness of the majority of developing countries are to be solved  the international community must study more innovative solutions  including the conversion of part of the debt into grants and long-term rescheduling of the debt on less onerous conditions. Such solutions should in no way reduce the trend towards concessions for the low-income countries  including those that are implementing structural adjustment programmes. It is essential that multilateral development institutions increase their support. The declaration adopted by consensus at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (ÜNCÏAD)  concerning trade  indebtedness and commodities  could  if implemented  guarantee a new era of co-operation between the developed and the developing countries. The fact that the various groups and trends represented at the Conference reached a consensus is a sign that there was positive and pragmatic multilateral economic co-operation  despite the negative forecasts that had been made previously.The Republic of Equatorial Guinea  in accordance with resolution 34/123  adopted by the General Assembly on 14 December 1979  undertook  with the United Nations system  a programme of special economic assistance. Various friendly countries and international organizations and institutions gave their support in the implementation of that programme. Since that time  the Government has drawn up a broad programme which includes the rehabilitation of the economic and administrative infrastructure  the reactivation of productive activities  the organization of State institutions  and a process of democratisation within the framework of a State based on law  where respect for the traditional values of the people must be harmonized with the protection and guaranteeing of fundamental human rights  in accordance with the modern concept thereof.It is correct to state that my country has effected positive organizational changes and has put into practice a public administration and a State organization which include institutions that make it possible to carry out the tasks with a clear separation among the three branches of power of the State. There has been considerable progress in regard to human rights  and Equatorial Guinea is a party to the main international instruments governing human rights.There has been a prolonged crisis in Equatorial Guinea's economy because of the destruction of its productive capacity; the external trade and financing conditions have made it impossible for us to overcome that crisis. National and international efforts have been made to alleviate the social and economic situation  and it has been possible to restore peace and the normal functioning of our society  to rebuild international relations and a system of external co-operation and assistance  and to rehabilitate and put into operation a new political and constitutional order-However  similar results have not been achieved in the economic sphere. There is an obvious contradiction between  on the one hand  the position of certain countries  organizations and international institutions that impose a scheme or conditionality on a country with the special features of Equatorial Guinea without giving due consideration to its social  political and institutional priorities and  on the other hand  the broader and more effective spirit of international assistance that has been advocated by the political and financial authorities of the world Powers.We appeal to the United Nations to do what it has done in similar circumstances - that is  in this situation of stagnation to make its own judgement of Equatorial Guinea's conditions and policies and to propose acceptable alternatives in order to overcome the impasse with donors  so that the necessary measures may be taken to ensure that the development strategy drawn up by the Government for the Round-Table Conference can be submitted without delay to the donor countries and organizations and can have the greatest chance of success."
"58",2810,"GRC",42,1987,"﻿Allow me  Sir  on behalf of the Government of Greece  to congratulate you on your election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. You represent a country with which Greece maintains ties of sincere friendship. Your extensive experience in international affairs and the abilities which have distinguished you as a successful diplomat give us the certainty that the work of this session will be brought to a successful conclusion. I should also like to avail myself of the opportunity to express to your predecessor  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhuty  our appreciation of the able manner and the effectiveness with which he guided the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.I should like  further  to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the dedication with which he devotes his services to the safeguarding of peace  in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations.The Foreign Minister of Denmark  Mr. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen  as President of the European Community  has already presented the positions of its 12 member States on the main issues confronting us today. These positions  with which we fully concur  reflect the international activities and responsibilities of the Community   as well as the common policies developed by its member States aimed at the promotion of stability and co-operation in international relations.I shall therefore limit myself to certain major issues of particular interest to Greece. The promotion of disarmament and out efforts to consolidate security constitute fundamental objectives of my Government's policy. Within the framework of that policy  which we have pursued with consistency  we have promoted a number of initiatives at the national  regional and international level. The Prime Minister of Greece  together with the leaders of the other countries participating in the well-known initiative of the Six  are continuing their untiring efforts towards nuclear disarmament.The momentous developments of recent days are a source of great satisfaction and of hope for the future. The agreement reached in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of Intermediate-range nuclear weapons constitutes a big step towards the banning of all nuclear weapons. We congratulate the leaders of the two super-Powers  President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The success of these negotiations gives us grounds for hoping that the relations between East and West will continue to improve. At the same time  we express the hope that an agreement on the reduction of strategic weapons by 50 per cent will become a reality  as will the complete cessation o ť all nuclear tests. However  we are also concerned at the continuing rapid increase m conventional armaments. The existing imbalances constitute a serious threat to international peace. We are convinced that  given the necessary good will  it is possible to reach viable agreements regarding balanced reductions of such armaments and an effective system of verification.I would be remiss if I did not repeat at this point  as I did last year  our apprehension regarding the continuing spread and use of chemical weapons  which constitute a flagrant violation of existing international rules and agreements  we are convinced that one of the aims of the international community should be a complete ban on the production and use of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles.The reduction of all types of armaments is an imperative necessity in a world with limited natural and financial resources. While hundreds of millions of people on our planet are suffering from extreme poverty and are not in a position to develop their economies  the spending of vast amounts on armaments constitutes blatant provocation. That is why we attach particular importance to the result of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. The adoption by consensus of its Final Document is an encouraging indication of the international community's political will to face the problems of developing countries through substantial progress in disarmament.My country  consistent with its policy of promoting peace and detente  has always supported the efforts of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as a means of maintaining a constructive dialogue between East and West. We have every reason to hope that substantial progress will be achieved during the fourth phase of the Vienna meeting which has just begun. It is fortunate that this meeting comes at a time of encouraging activity in the field of conventional disarmament and of the agreement reached in principle between the two super-Powers on the elimination of the intermediate-range missiles from Europe. The circumstances in which the Vienna meeting is taking place are unique  and we should exploit them as a first-rate opportunity for the maintenance of security and the promotion of co-operation in Europe.I should like to stress at this point that a condition for the maintenance of security and the promotion of co-operation in Europe and the improvement of the political climate in that region is the creation of a feeling of confidence. Specifically  the promotion of confidence at the regional level is an imperative need. My Government is proud that after continuous efforts it was able to develop the closest possible relations with most of Greece's neighbours. The Balkans  in the past the powder-keg of Europe  are today a model of regional co-operation between countries with different political and economic systems. I wish also to underline the consistency and firmness with which my Government supports the proposal to make the Balkans a zone free from nuclear and chemical weapons.Another area on which the attention of my Government is particularly focused is that of the Mediterranean  as it is related directly to the security of Greece. We have repeatedly stated that the Mediterranean should become a sea of peace  friendship and co-operation among its peoples. We have sincerely supported all efforts to that end.We deal with international problems and examine them simply from the viewpoint of the countries involved while tending to ignore the fact that  in the final analysis  it is the individual who is the victim of international conflicts. When some countries spend enormous amounts on armaments  instead of directing them to development projects necessary to improve the living standards of their people  in the end it is the individual who suffers. If countries that have blatantly violated and disregarded decisions of the United Nations persist in policies which have been condemned  again it is the individual who suffers.My Government is deeply concerned over the question of the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the promotion of social  economic and cultural rights. The problem transcends regional relationships. It is a problem with international repercussions. We are particularly satisfied to see that the United Nations is continuing its efforts in this field and that it has not been discouraged by the many obstacles it has encountered and by the flagrant violations of human rights.It is our conviction that all States are bound to comply strictly with their international obligations deriving from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant international instruments subsequently adopted. Compliance with these obligations is a duty  not an option. As far as we are concerned  we have always unequivocally condemned every violation of human rights  regardless of where and by whom it is committed. The Greek Government has taken an unreserved position in favour of the equality of the two sexes. It has actively participated in all regional and international efforts to ensure the complete elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. At the national level we have adopted policies in favour of a status of women equal to that of men  in all fields of economic  social and cultural life. Within the United Nations we actively support the strengthening of and an increase in the activities of the committees dealing with women's issues.The problem of international terrorism  although it has been less acute in recent months  is still a destabilizing factor in international relations. My country has severely suffered because of terrorism. My Government has repeatedly condemned and continues to condemn every terrorist act  regardless of its origin. The present session of the General Assembly will deal with this subject. We hope that it will be possible  with the co-operation of all States  to reach positive and substantive results and that the consensus reached during the fortieth session will be maintained.Year after year the United Nations deals with a number of major international issues. These issues still appear on the agenda  which shows how little progress we have made towards their solution. However  there have been some encouraging developments.We welcome the recent initiative of the Heads of State of the five Central American countries which led to an agreement for the implementation of a peace plan in the area. We consider this to be a notable achievement by five small countries which have decided to take their fate into their own hands and establish the forms of co-operation for their own region. My Government is convinced that the countries in Central America cam peacefully resolve their problems without foreign intervention. We attach particular importance to the application of democratic procedures and to respect for human and civil rights  and we believe that proposals made for a unilateral cessation of hostilities can be of assistance in this respect. I believe that all countries should respond positively to the appeal made from this rostrum to ensure the success of the peace plan in Central America.My country  as is well known  attaches particular importance to developments in the Middle East  an area where not only peace in the region but also international stability and security are in danger. The Arab-Israeli conflict remains unresolved  as there has been no change in the situation created by the use of force  the occupation of Arab territories since 1967 by Israel and the lack of a substantive and comprehensive peace process. The fact that the idea of an international conference  which my country has supported for a long time  seems to be gaining ground  even among those that until recently categorically rejected it  gives us ground for hope. Greece has from the outset supported the idea of convening an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations for the solution of the Middle East problem in which all the directly interested parties would participate. Recent decisions of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Community present a satisfactory framework for starting an effective peace process.We believe  furthermore  that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) should participate in the conference and that the modalities of its participation concern the Arab countries and  in particular  the Palestinians themselves. This conference should have a substantive role  not be converted into a ceremonial forum. It is obvious that the modalities of the conference should be decided by the interested parties themselves  including the PLO  which is the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We hope that the last obstacles impeding the convening of a conference may soon be overcome.We have repeatedly stressed that the basic pre-condition of a peace settlement in the Middle East is the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories. We support the aspirations of the Palestinian people to exercise the fundamental  Inalienable right to self-determination  including the eight to create their own State.At the same time  it is well known that we support the right of Israel to exist as a State within internationally recognized and secure borders. However  Israel should not deny to the Palestinian people what it rightly seeks for itself - namely  the right to exist. Nor can the international community tolerate the illegal policy of the imposition of arbitrary measures  the establishment of settlements and the creation of fait accompli in the occupied territories. Such a policy  as in the case of Cyprus  is aimed at altering the legal status of the territories in question and their geographic  natural and demographic conditions  and distorting their history and the identity of their inhabitants.The tragic situation in Lebanon continues unabated despite some occasional faint hopes of a peace settlement  which unfortunately quickly fade. My country again calls upon the interested parties and those exercising influence to work peacefully to preserve the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon and eliminate violence.The war between Iran and Iraq also continues unabated despite the appeals and efforts of the international community. We have also recently witnessed an increase in tension in the vital area of the Gulf.The tragedy of that war  which entails enormous costs to the two peoples involved  and the magnitude of the dangers created by the ever increasing escalation of tension in the Gulf make it imperative that hostilities cease and peace talks begin  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council  including resolution 598 (1987). We appreciate the devotion and courage which the Secretary-General displayed in discharging his duties during his mission  for the purpose of securing respect for and full implementation of those resolutions.I also wish to stress the importance that my Government attaches to safeguarding free and secure navigation in the area. I must insist upon this point because  unfortunately  my country has suffered from indiscriminate attacks upon Greek merchant vessels  which have caused enormous material damage and the loss of innocent lives.The situation in southern Africa continues  regrettably  to endanger peace  security and stability. Greece is watching developments in the area with particular interest. The number of victims of apartheid Increases daily. The extension of the state of emergency and the continuous violations of human rights - in particular  detention of religious and trade union leaders  detention of children  torture and forced resettlement of the black population and strict press censorship - are developments that deeply preoccupy my Government.The Greek Government has repeatedly and unequivocally condemned the abhorrent system of apartheid and its inherent violence. We call upon the Government of South Africa to engage in a national dialogue with the genuine representatives of the majority of the population  which should lead to the complete eradication of apartheid and the establishment by peaceful means of a democratic  non-racial and United South Africa.We strongly condemn South Africa's repeated aggressive and destabilizing activities against the sovereignty  Independence and territorial integrity of neighbouring States. Greece affirms its solidarity with the front-line States  which should receive full International support in order to cope successfully with the threat against them. In 1986 a highly significant meeting took place in Lusaka between representatives of the European Community and the front-line States. I attended that meeting and remain convinced of its usefulness. I hope that those efforts will continue.We also strongly condemn the continuation of the illegal occupation by South Africa of Namibia  whose people are being denied the right to exercise the fundamental right to self-determination and independence. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) constitutes the sole internationally accepted basis for the peaceful solution of the problem. The Greek Government categorically rejects any linkage of the Implementation of resolution 435 (1978) with extraneous issues  as well as delaying tactics used for this purpose. We consider the establishment In Namibia of the so-called interim administration to be null and void.The Greek Government expresses its concern with regard to the dangerous situation prevailing in two areas of Asia: Afghanistan and Kampuchea. It is regrettable that diplomatic efforts towards their solution have not yet produced the hoped-for results. We are consistent in condemning all cases of invasion and occupation as well as every effort to create fait accompli. We therefore believe that unless all foreign troops in Afghanistan and Kampuchea are withdrawn as soon as possible in accordance with United Nations resolutions no viable solution can be reached. It is imperative that the bloodshed and suffering of the people of these two countries be brought to an end.With regard to the situation in the Korean peninsula  we hope that a just and peaceful solution will be found  to the benefit of the entire Korean people  in accordance with the generally accepted principles of international law. We believe that the promotion of confidence-building measures in the Korean peninsula will create the appropriate conditions for the Olympic Games of 1988 to take place in an atmosphere of co-operation rather than confrontation.The international economic situation shows signs of stress. Imbalances remain  growth rates are low and the future is uncertain. The resumption of high and stable growth rates must be secured in order to bring about solutions to the debt problems of the developing countries and an improvement in the market conditions for their primary commodities.The third world's external debt crisis must be resolved through dialogue and greater understanding of the problem by the international community. We should not lose sight of the political dimension of this problem. The people of the over—indebted countries shouldering the unbearable burden of external debt are deprived of a dignified standard of living. As a result  phenomena of social turmoil have surfaced. The low prices of primary commodities have severely curtailed the exchange earnings of a large number of developing countries. Those countries face serious difficulties in servicing their external debt while implementing strict stabilization programmes  unfortunately  development assistance to those countries and flows of new capital from the international financial system have not yet reached the levels necessary to permit successful implementation of their stabilization policies. For that reason development efforts have fallen behind.The final text adopted by the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) provides a framework for remedial solutions. At the same time imaginative and courageous solutions should be pursued In international forums  particularly at the International Monetary Fund  whose annual meetings begin today.I should like to elaborate on an issue of particular concern to the Greek nation that in recent years has been repeatedly dealt with by the United Nations. I am referring to the problem of Cyprus  prolongation of which entails a serious threat to peace and security  not only in the immediate vicinity but also in the broader area of the eastern Mediterranean.More than 13 years have passed since the Turkish array  in flagrant violation of the basic principles of international law  invaded Cyprus and occupied a large part of the territory of the Republic. After the invasion Ankara attempted as a first step to stabilize its military occupation and to drive out those remaining Greek Cypriots who had not yet fled  to become refugees in their own country  the Invading Turkish army. Subsequently  Ankara attempted to alter the demographic composition of the population through a massive influx of settlers  which it organized politically in order to support an illegal government whose existence depends on the equally illegal presence of the army of occupation. Furthermore  by destroying the cultural heritage of northern Cyprus  by plundering churches and by changing place-names  it is attempting to impose partition and create two separate states in an effort to avert the unity of Cyprus.For 13 years Turkey has systematically avoided any discussion of those subjects which  by definition  are pre-eminent; namely  withdrawal of the occupation array; agreement on a system of guarantees that would preclude the presentation of pretexts such as those Ankara has raised to justify its invasion; and withdrawal of the settlers and application of elementary human rights concerning freedom of movement  freedom of settlement and the right to property.Ankara has refused to discuss those questions  which obviously should occupy a central position in the consultations. On the contrary  through repeated statements made by Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot leadership  Ankara has made it clear that it has no intention of withdrawing its military forces from the territory of Cyprus  which it is systematically reinforcing with new modern tanks as well as through increasing military personnel. The recent report of the United Nations Secretary-General to the Security Council gives an extremely clear picture of the situation in the area and points out a number of other Turkish and Turkish Cypriot activities that aim solely at the consolidation of the illegal occupation.The Government of the Republic of Cyprus  in an attempt to help the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices  has proposed alternative procedures aiming at the examination of the aforementioned major issues  that is  either at a high-level meeting or at an international conference. The Greek Government fully supports the position of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus that  before any further discussion on other issues that have already been dealt with  the major issues should be examined - namely  withdrawal of the occupation forces and of the settlers  a new system of enlarged international guarantees precluding the possibility of unilateral intervention and the three freedoms.It should in particular be stressed that up to now Turkey has refused any discussion of those issues. That attitude is a clear indication of its ultimate aims. It wants to entrap the Government of the Republic of Cyprus into accepting a constitutional system that would serve Turkish interests solely and make no provision for the withdrawal of the occupation army or the settlers or for the restoration of the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. However  the position of Ankara is highly provocative when it argues that a discussion of the critical problem of Cyprus at this session constitutes a manifestation of intransigence. Indeed  I am astonished at that argument  which expresses a deeper contempt for the United Nations and for the inalienable right of every sovereign Member State to have recourse to the Organization in every case of violation of the principles of the Charter and of the resolutions of United Nations organs.Confronted with this situation we have to decide where our duty lies. It would be distressing and dangerous were we to limit ourselves to the expression of hopes and to regrets over lack of progress. I believe it is time for all of us to face up to our responsibilities and to make it crystal clear that force cannot be accepted as a way of resolving international problems Greece is convinced that a just and viable solution to the Cyprus question should be sought within the framework of the United Nations and  more specifically/ through the implementation of the numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions  which clearly and unequivocally provide for ways to resolve all these major Issues  it is only natural that we look to the United Nations for a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem. An injustice committed in any part of the world is an injustice against mankind. It is therefore the duty of mankind to restore justice."
"59",2851,"GRD",42,1987,"﻿The fact that the Grenada delegation is speaking on the last day of the general debate in no way diminishes my delegation's pleasure at seeing you  Sir  preside over the business of the forty-second session of the General Assembly  with confidence and competence. My delegation joins in the many eloquent expressions of praise and gratitude to your distinguished predecessor for his outstanding conduct of the forty-first session. The Grenada delegation also shares in the many warm tributes paid to the Secretary-General  for his untiring efforts and great diplomatic skills in the pursuit of peace. My delegation greets  salutes and congratulates the newly appointed Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs  Ambassador Reed  who is amiable and knowledgeable.When the curtain fell on the forty-first session many resolutions had been passed  and many situations had been resolved  for which that body could justly be proud. However  as the curtain rose on the forty-second session  certain perennial global issues impinging upon international peace and security remain unresolved. ī shall refer to some of them presently.The word ""peace"" echoes  re-echoes and reverberates throughout the length and breadth of this Hall  with a frequency that is almost deafening. And this is how it should be. For what the world needs most at this time is peace. If peace is allowed to elude mankind indefinitely  the threat of nuclear war  which hangs over the universe like the sword of Damocles  will continue to contribute to the possibility of man's becoming an endangered species. Peace in the global context is not just the absence of war. Rather  it is a state arrived at when certain geopolitical  social  moral  economic and physical forces are in balance  under the impetus of a catalyst called ""justice"". Attainment of this state of equilibrium is more easily said than done  for the following reason.Unlike the natural sciences - mathematics  physics  chemistry  biology  and so forth - for which there exist appropriate equations and formulas for the solution of problems  in the social sciences  where peace  justice  security  morality and other global issues lie  there are no comparable equations and formulas. Resort is therefore made to reason  understanding  conscience  morality  past experience  compromise  good will  and so forth  in the resolution of those knotty global issues which impinge upon international peace and security. And therein lies the dilemma.In the practice of the art of diplomacy to resolve geopolitical issues  there are certain ingredients - association  compromise  confrontation  exclusion - which must be applied in delicate balance for the resolution of those dangerous situations which impinge upon international peace and security. How  when  where  why these ingredients are brought into play becomes the art and challenge of diplomacy.Some of the pressing global issues referred to during the general debate are also of grave concern to my delegation. The Iran-Iraq war  which began as a series of border conflicts in 1980  has now escalated into a full-blown conflagration on land  sea and air  despite the efforts of the Security Council and the Secretary-General to mediate the dispute. Of humanitarian concern are the attacks on civilian targets; the resort to chemical warfare  contrary to the Geneva Protocol of 1925; the treatment of prisoners of war; and the interference with the right of free navigation  trade and commerce in international waters. The present situation in the Persian Gulf is fraught with dangerous implications and consequences. It should not be allowed to degenerate further.The pernicious and odious racial policies of South Africa - apartheid — have been of major concern to the international community for at least 35 years. Apartheid is systematized and institutionalised racism  which has no place in civilized society  for it is cruel and inhuman. The Security Council has labelled it a crime against humanity. The Prime Minister of Grenada  the Right Honourable Herbert A. Blaize  when addressing the fortieth session of the General Assembly referred to apartheid as ""injustice institutionalised"". He stated:""There must  therefore  be urgent  united action to rid South Africa of the scourge of apartheid and minority rule  and to bring independence to Namibia"". (A/40/PV.35  p. 48-50)Grenada's Minister of External Affairs  in his statement to the forty-first session of the General Assembly  emphasized that""Grenada will to the extent possible  and consistent with its own policies  support any move or action by the international community designed to bring about the dismantling of apartheid and the achievement of majority rule in South Africa"". (A/41/PV.32  p. 8)A Grenadines patriot  T. Albert Marryshow  of beloved and revered memory  the centennial of whose birth we are celebrating this year  wrote in 1917 in a series entitled ""Cycles of Civilization"" - a veritable literary treasure in the Grenada archives - that the civilized world would have to come to grips with the racist policies of South Africa in the future. I want to emphasize that that was 1917  long before there were many independent African States  long before the United Nations came into being. Marryshow concentrated much of his historical  ferocious  but justifiable attack on General Jan Smuts  one of the early architects of the emerging apartheid practice. There was a man of prophetic vision speaking out alone in the colonies in 1917 against what was then considered to be a normal and benign situation. Today the situation in South Africa is the most abnormal and most malignant on the face of the earth - tyranny of the minority  terrorization of the majority.The external-debt problem  with its adverse economic consequences  especially in the developing countries  is a perfect example of how international peace and security can be threatened by a situation which can have dire social  political and economic consequences. Debt repayment and debt servicing  pose a hardship foe  and place a stranglehold on  the economy of many developing countries  akin to a millstone around their necks. While the repayment of debt is a legal and moral responsibility of the debtor  debt relief should be a humane and moral consideration of some of the creditors  who in the context of the present global situation may be practising simple justice by putting back into the good earth a little of what has been taken out. History is replete with examples of how exploitation and injustice could have contributed to the debt problem.To the least developed countries  whose social and humanitarian programmes are held in abeyance because of debt repayment and debt servicing  the cynicism mingled with humour of a socio-economist can be applied - namely  that the inherent vice in some economic systems is the unequal sharing of blessings  while the inherent virtue in others is the equal sharing of miseries. In the final analysis  if the external-debt problem is allowed to erode further  the economies of both developed and developing countries stand to suffer.As one of the smallest island developing States Members of the United Nations  Grenada has a special interest in the question of island developing countries.Almost three years ago  on 18 December 1984  resolution 39/121  entitled ""Specific measures in favour of island developing countries"" was adopted by the General Assembly. That resolution reiterated the call for specific action in favour of island developing countries contained in five previous resolutions. Additionally  three resolutions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) called on the international community to recognize the special characteristics and handicaps of island developing countries  and to provide appropriate support to them in their development efforts.Unfortunately  nothing has been achieved except that in its resolution 41/163 of 5 December 1986 the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report  which would include specific recommendations to ensure that the Assembly at its forty-third session would be able to review the situation and act accordingly  in the interest of island developing countries. Grenada's delegation anticipates with high expectation positive results at the forty-third session.With respect to the special needs of island developing countries  my delegation is reminded of the saying of the great Chinese sage and philosopher  Confucius: give a man a fish  and you satisfy his needs for a day; teach a man to fish  and you satisfy his needs for many a day.In Central America  the recent peace initiative undertaken by five Presidents  which resulted in the Guatemala Agreement of 7 August  is a credit to their vision  judgement and spirit of goodwill. The ray of hope  the crack in the door  which the Agreement introduces should be seized upon. After examination  study and modification  where necessary  that historic document can form the basis for peace in the region. The settling of disputes by resort to force and violence is anachronistic and dangerous. All that is right or reasonable pleads for sister republics to make peace within States and among nations.In the Middle East  the Arab-Israeli dispute  which has been festering for some time  is now approaching a chronic state which could complicate the general Middle East situation. The doctrine of the right to self-determination is valid and indisputable. The right of Israel to exist as a State - a fait accompli for nearly 40 years - within safe and secure borders is well established. The existence of Israel is a fact of life which should not be challenged. Similarly  the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland within secure and recognized boundaries is a principle that has validity. The claim of the Palestinian people to a homeland in the land of their ancestors is a matter of history and simple justice. Their claim should not be thwarted as long as there is recognition of the principle of sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence.It is believed that through the universal language of music  through the universal medium of sports  the world stands the best hope of attaining the universal goal of brotherhood. With this in mind  it is the hope of the Grenada delegation that the games of the XXIVth Olympiad  which will take place at Seoul  Korea  from 17 September to 2 October 1988  and the preparations for the Games will introduce a healing process so that the Korean problem can be resolved in the best interest of the Korean people. In the meantime the reality is that there are two Koreas  North Korea and South Korea  separated by a demilitarised zone under the supervision of United Nations forces. This interim arrangement will  it is hoped  yield to negotiation and dialogue  to the end that the Korean people may soon take their place in the international community.In Cyprus  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  the Falklands (Malvinas) and other areas of conflict it is the hope and prayer of my delegation that wisdom  understanding and justice will prevail  to the end that peace may eventually be assured.An area of global interest and common concern is the illicit trafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances  which  like the plague  is spreading over the face of the earth and gnawing at the very fabric of society. Concomitant with the craze for those dangerous substances is the proportionate increase in the level of violence  which is fast creating a seamy subculture in some societies. It is generally believed that drugs and international terrorism have a direct relationship. This twin menace is growing bolder every day and wreaking havoc on innocent and unsuspecting people. It should be interdicted at the source.Another area of global concern is the rapid spread of acquired immune—deficiency syndrome (AIDS)  which like a scourge is approaching pandemic proportions. In this regard the prestigious United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) should continue to focus on the aetiology  prognosis and therapy for this health hazard  which has dangerous social consequences. The step recently taken by the President of the United States of America and the General Secretary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in agreeing in principle on the elimination of medium-range missiles from their nuclear arsenals is indeed heartening and inspires hope. It is the hope of mankind that  just as a journey of 1 000 miles begins with a single step  so the first step has been taken down the long  difficult and tortuous road towards total and complete nuclear disarmament.Finally  listening and speaking in this fraternal forum of the United Nations  where confrontational and adversarial issues very often arise  my delegation is chastened by the divine admonition first have peace in your hearts  and then you will able to give peace to others."
"60",2898,"GTM",42,1987,"﻿I come before the Assembly representing the Guatemalan nation and its desire to contribute to peace in the world by helping build peace in Central America.The Guatemalan people  as I pointed out in my statement in this Assembly in 1986  have taken over the conduct of their own history and are determined to travel  step by step  the road leading to the attainment of our own utopia: to make Guatemalan society a profoundly humane society  based on participation and pluralism  in which all inhabitants  without distinction as to race  ideology  social sector or economic status  can contribute actively to the taking of decisions essential to our nation. In order to travel that road  the people have chosen the criteria that we have proposed  and in order to attain our objectives we are making rational use of the available human and material resources.It is important to emphasize this latter point  because when one seeks to understand the nature of the proposals we have made to our nation and to Central America one finds in all of them a conscious choice of absolute respect for the life of men and the preservation of the natural resources available to us  so that they may serve all Guatemalan families rather than the interests of a single sector. The attainment of objectives at the lowest possible cost without compromising our principles is the common denominator of each of the measures we have adopted. We reject the concept that appears to have become widespread in recent decades  that the attainment of objectives justifies loss of human life or the destruction of the infrastructure and of natural resources  which do not belong to any ideology  faction or economic group but rather to the nation.On the basis of that principle  we have made it our practice in all circumstances to work towards agreement and avoid confrontation. We define consensus as the maximum degree of agreement possible within disagreement and/ even though we exercise legitimate power in taking final decisions  we always make the greatest effort to ensure that those decisions will be the fruit of an extended process of consultation  discussion and the contribution of ideas even by those social  economic or political groups that do not share with us the ideological underpinnings that define the democratic society that we espouse. If at any time we have had to confront any sector  group or faction of our society  it has been because of its intransigence or negative attitude in the search for a common solution for the benefit of the community.We call this process of seeking a consensus concerted effort. It is a method that some would describe as naive and others as slow or inefficient. But  since we pride ourselves on being familiar with our own history and do not wish to relive it  we well know that all other methods - violence or the exercise of absolute power - have  in the course of our independent life and particularly in the past 20 years  produced only destruction and death without achieving positive results for the benefit of our peoples  which still await a solution to many of their most elementary problems. A decision of this nature requires historic courage because it involves a definitive change in many of the traditional attitudes of certain of the leaders of our countries: the temptation to seek absolute power; the rejection of ideological pluralism; party or sectoral fanaticism; the selfishness of the economic interests of families or individualism and  especially  the Impatience that often leads to erroneous decisions to accelerate processes that should develop throughout the life of an entire generation  in the hope that they can be completed successfully within a presidential term of office. Our peoples are tired of being sacrificed to experiment and expect of us  the current leaders of the Central American and American nations and of the nations of the world  a serious  prudent and realistic attitude  so that the path towards the construction of a more humane society will become a one-way street.Today  democracy and human rights are inseparable concepts. If the restoration of democracy in a nation that has lost it is a difficult task  it is no less difficult to establish respect for human rights in a society that has suffered from a climate of violence.The constitution of Guatemala  which governs our democracy  accords a primary place to human rights  and my Government has successfully undertaken to guarantee and protect those rights. Those concepts  which guide Guatemala's political conduct  are also fundamental to the policies we advocate at the international level  namely  active neutrality and a Central American parliament.In defining the concept of active neutrality  particular account should be taken of its political  ideological and methodological aspects  and a due relationship to the legal sphere should be established as appropriate. Some who have commented on this concept have indicated that there can be no active neutrality  because when viewing the concept they take the two words separately; naturally  the word ""neutrality "" taken in its international context  has its basis in legal language. Our proposal is an integrated concept that would correspond to our international policy and would mean rejecting involvement in armed conflicts and working actively to achieve peace through diplomacy or political action involving concerted effort.That policy is based on the belief that those efforts should be aimed at achieving agreements and establishing consensus to reduce any chance of confrontation so as to achieve the final objectives at the lowest possible cost. Of course  although we reject armed confrontation  we must recognize that there are problems in our region that could lead to such confrontation. In our history  many of the internal conflicts of our country have been instigated  supported  fomented or  at the very least  tolerated by some neighbouring countries that have  sought to impose their own ideology or to prevent the implantation of a neighbour's political system in their own country. That gravely erroneous course must not be repeated. We must attempt to establish in each country of Central America the conditions necessary for tolerance  pluralism and the free participation of all sectors in the political life of the nation.If we act within the framework of established norms and in consultation with the people  using the most appropriate machinery to secure their effective and free participation  that will reduce domestic tensions and the chance of conflicts among our countries and inevitably lead to mutual respect  which we are entitled to expect.Instead of accepting confrontation  we must act to establish methods that allow dialogue to lead to an understanding of our problems and to their solution. That is the meaning of ""active neutrality"": the rejection of armed conflict and active efforts to secure peace through concerted effort.An international policy such as the one we have defined  the backbone of which is recognition of the realities peculiar to each country and the search for accords designed to establish regional consensus  requires a permanent instrument for implementation of the proposed method of concerted effort to establish the bases for Central American political unity  which would be the historical consequence  in the medium or longer term  of such a process.Thus the proposed Central American parliament would be a forum for discussions and the taking of decisions relating to the solution of problems common to all of us or that affect one or more of the region's countries  problems that could threaten generalized conflict and impede the economic and social development of our peoples.Such a parliament  inspired by the model of the European Parliament  would also seek to make our peoples and the various political and economic social sectors parts of the process of regional integration. It is vitally important that its members be elected directly. That would resolve the problem presented by broad political spread and pluralism and would open the way to proportional representation. At the same time  the proposed system would guarantee respect for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of each country. The parliament could even eventually establish a higher-level political body in the form of a presidential commission to give executive validity to agreements reached at the parliamentary level.A Central American parliament could also complement and strengthen those negotiating formulas that may lead to peace in the region through concerted effort and the setting aside of traditional attitudes of polarity and confrontation.Concerted effort  active neutrality and a Central American parliament - those are the political instruments that embody our country's position in the context of the present-day reality of Central America and the need to achieve political stability  security and peace in the region.With those instruments  we seek to inspire a positive and optimistic attitude towards the future without forgetting our geopolitical context and our economic and social problems  and to bring about specific and imaginative solutions to those problems that take both national and regional interests into account. With those concepts  we hope to give the countries of Central America an opportunity to work with all nations interested in our region. We hope to enable them to act together so that with each agreement and each year a further step will be taken towards making the peoples of Central America true protagonists in the historic events we are experiencing.From the foregoing  it is easy to deduce the short- and medium-term objectives of Guatemala's international policy. The first objective is the initiation of a peace process. Peace in Central America is more than a utopian goal; it is a fundamental necessity in the process of the economic and social development of each country.Armed groups that use violence in their attempts to wrest political power from constituted Governments provoke armed clashes that are no longer merely modes of political struggle but serious obstacles to the solution of political  economic and social problems. Those struggles  which entail a constant waste of resources  destroy the scant infrastructures of regions that have barely begun the process of modernization  and they compel Governments to allocate vast resources to armed confrontation instead of to the building of broader and more efficient infrastructures that can meet the basic needs of the populations. In such small-scale conflicts the final outcome is less significant than the fact that they prevent the countries involved from consolidating the democracy to which all aspire.It is obvious that in the situation in Central America  at least in certain ' countries  violence is a major obstacle to the solution of economic and social problems. We are concerned that such violence may increase and become more widespread. The prevention of such a disaster was the goal of the Central American Presidents at the two meetings held in Guatemala  Escruipulas I and II  in which we sought formulas to eliminate the causes of confrontation and lay the foundations for harmonious and fraternal coexistence.At the last meeting we not only worked to avoid the eventuality to which I have referred; when discussing the proposal contained in the document submitted by the President of Costa Rica  we also lay the foundations for processes to eradicate the causes of problems created by armed conflict that were leading to difficult situations  particularly in some countries.Thus  in Central America it is not necessary merely to stop war; it is also necessary to begin to construct an infrastructure that would help to institutionalise democracy in the area and guarantee lasting peace and economic and social development. The essential corollary of peace is political stability  which is possible in a pluralistic environment in which all the sectors of society can organize and take part in the major decisions of the nation. My personal idea - and I am sure it is shared by the Guatemalan nation - is that that process can occur only in a democratic society  because that kind of society makes it possible to lower the tensions that lead to polarization and confrontation. In fact  our current experience in Guatemala - like the experience of other Latin American nations - shows that it is possible to solve economic and social problems through political pluralism and the organized participation of the people. If that process is consolidated in the Central American region over an extended period  we shall guarantee the wise use of our resources and their equitable distribution among all the sectors of the population.But  while stability is necessary for the development of a nation  it is even more necessary for the development of a given region. Therefore  we state that institutionalising the political processes and learning to work together and develop our autonomy of action are factors that will help to make the Central American region stable.No efforts to achieve peace and political stability can be sustained long enough unless the process of what I have referred to as ""concerted effort"" becomes institutionalised. That is why the proposal for a Central American parliament has been made - a political institution which would appropriately complement the various economic and cultural organizations that have been developed over recent years in the region  and which would help to create new institutions to strengthen and update the functioning of those earlier institutions.Those three objectives are absolutely complementary  and we can state that we are on the way to achieving them  having signed the agreement of 7 August this year. The five Central American Presidents  overcoming the regional tradition  resolved their differences and  taking realistic account of the factors and circumstances that have a bearing on the Central American region  reached an agreement which  by its political scope and its potential effects  is in itself an example of concerted effort for the other nations of the world to see; the highest level of agreement possible within disagreement.The document signed by the Presidents in the quest for a procedure for firm and lasting peace in Central America is truly a logical step towards the achievement of the objectives that I have described. That agreement would not have been possible without the contribution and the efforts of the Latin American countries of the Contadora Group and the unreserved solidarity of the nations of the Support Group. There can be no doubt that those efforts helped to promote an appropriate environment for a thorough discussion  in the various political and economic forums throughout America  of the problems of Central America. That led to the serious and strong endorsement of the expectations opened up by the signing of the ""Esquipulas II"" agreement.It is my duty to acknowledge the role played by each of my Central American colleagues in the drawing up of this agreement. I laud the political courage and the historic commitment demonstrated by each of the nations in subscribing to that agreement  notwithstanding all the difficulties that each one of us could face as a result of internal and external opposition. Of course  we could not have taken any decision without the untiring efforts of the Foreign Ministers and their working teams  which made the necessary opening that enabled us to take the decisions at the right time. The ""Esquipulas ΙΙ"" agreement is only a first step on a long road. We cannot proclaim to the world that the mere fact of having signed it has solved all the problems  that peace and stability have been achieved. Far from it: now comes the hard part of this task  because if it was difficult to achieve agreements that seemed quite improbable  it is even more difficult to put them into effect.We Guatemalans  at any rate  are optimistic  because we believe that we can go a very long way if there is the political will to move ahead. Our peoples back us up. We look forward ardently to peace. We ate tired of suffering. That is why this agreement has encouraged a regional movement for peace  which young people and women have joined. That was the case at the first meeting of Central American First Ladies  held recently in Guatemala. And there will be other cultural and social events during the remainder of the year at which young people will manifest their feelings in this respect.Today  I appeal to the international community to help us to convert the ""Esquipulas II"" agreement into concrete reality  so that that process will truly lead to a firm and lasting peace in Central America which will make it possible for us to change  once and for all  the sad destiny that had seemed inevitable for our peoples. There have been certain major achievements in this process already. For example  the interest of many countries in various continents has been aroused in the need to co-operate foe the economic and social development of the region. It has repeatedly been pointed out that it would be most important for this co-operation to be provided to the five Central American countries at the same time as a process of democratisation was being developed. This is the time for the international community to show its solidarity at all levels. I have no doubt that the response to this appeal will be enthusiastic and will enable us to feel that we are not alone in our struggle for a new regional society.In that sense  we regard the interest of North American public opinion in the problems of Central America as very positive. We know that the people of the United States have a commitment to the cause of democracy and freedom in the world. That is why I wish to repeat here the appeal of the Central Americans for a quest for a bipartisan agreement in the United States in regard to our region.In order to achieve these objective  it is essential to accept the idea that in the quest for peace and democracy in Central America the agreement by the Presidents is not a point of reference that one can take or leave  but  rather  a point of departure for finding solutions. For the agreement represents what we want  and it is within the framework of that agreement - if it is respected - that the discussion for the achievement of a firm and lasting peace in Central America should be placed.We Central American Presidents have said what we should do to start  at long last  on the road leading to the realization of our aspirations: real and true democracy  in which all the sectors of the country will contribute and will participate in the taking of those decisions that will enable the political leaders to set up a government that will truly be of  for and by the people.The alternative is to let the process collapse  or to force us to choose some other path. I do not wish to discuss that here  or even to comment on it  because it is what has always occurred in the countries that do not have the monopoly of force. That is the sad part of the history of the world.Fortunately  a discussion has now been opened  in which we can talk about the method to change this traditional attitude and can abandon confrontation and move towards concerted political effort.We Central Americans are aware that our problems are embodied in a world-wide set of problems  and that our imaginative efforts can contribute to the quest for solutions in that context. The subjects of peace in the world deserve our special attention. That is why we look forward with great hope to the attainment by the great Powers of agreements leading to gradual disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons and all the risks of the destruction of mankind.Disarmament and development are two of the problems that weigh most heavily on the contemporary world they must be understood as two distinct processes that are closely related. Each has a separate development and distinct goals. One complements the other. Disarmament complements development by means of the reallocation of financial resources  which can be put to better use in development programmes  particularly the struggle against illiteracy  disease and malnutrition and the eradication of the poverty that afflicts more than two thirds of mankind. We sincerely believe in the need for a new international economic order and will therefore energetically support any effort to restore North-South dialogue·  and we are  of course  working to find new ways for South-South co-operation. I believe this is an area where much remains to be explored. Our role in the Group of 77 will always be to increase awareness of the need for greater and deeper links among developing countries.The situation of the world economy weighs heavily on the developing countries. What is even more serious  the prospects for their future development are gloomy. This state of affairs obtains despite the internal effort most of our countries have made through adjustment programmes. We are facing an alarming decline in the standard of living of large sectors of our societies  and we meet with a lack of understanding and with selfishness on the part of some of the most privileged sectors.It is clear that to escape the present deadlock we must make exhaustive efforts and accept sacrifices. Thus  we also need resolute and appropriate co-operation from the developed world. This must be a joint effort by all of us who make up the international community. The debt burden  limited financing and the sharp deterioration in terms of trade are problems we must face together  taking into account principles such as joint responsibility and solidarity.Subjects such as the establishment of machinery to facilitate the renegotiation of external debt payments and the promotion of agreements among developed countries enabling us to recycle capital in order to modernize our service infrastructure should be the subject of prompt  careful analysis.I am convinced that we are at the dawn of a new age in the history of mankind  when an awareness of the repercussions of war is making us try to build peace. The greatest responsibility here belongs to those who hold a monopoly of power  for they must let us exercise the sole power we have in good measure; the power of our own convictions.May God help our international society move in that direction. For then our efforts in Central America could enable us to set a good example  so that other regions  now suffering the consequences of violence and confrontation  might look with hope upon the power of appropriate political agreements to build peace and stability and respond to the call of our peoples for the fulfilment of their own basic needs."
"61",2943,"GUY",42,1987,"﻿The forty-second session of the General Assembly takes place against the background of some encouraging developments in international relations. It is Guyana  hope that the Organization will be able to Play its part in accelerating this positive trend. We are confident that during Comrade Florin's presidency he will deploy his well—known skills and tact in guiding our deliberations so that we may together reach conclusions which will be to the benefit of mankind as a whole. In offering Comrade Peter Florin an eminent son of the German Democratic Republic  our warmest congratulations on his unanimous elect ion ř I pledge the ready co-operation of my delegation in our search for global understanding and agreement·Let me take this opportunity also to extend felicitations to his predecessor in office# the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  for his admirable conduct of the Assembly  business during the past year.As we contemplate the many major issues which are before the Assembly  we cannot but be struck by their interrelationship and by the fact that the solutions to them must be based on a global approach· This is in acknowledgement of the reality that we live in an increasingly interdependent world  one in which it should be the aim of this Organization to advance in an equal way the interests of all Member States.Peace  as we all know  is indivisible. So too  I contend  is development. Many of the issues related to development  some of which are topical  affect us all  rich and poor. Debt  drugs and disease are not indigenous to any one people. They are ubiquitous. If we are to ensure global stability  it would be foolhardy to seek their eradication in certain areas while they flourish elsewhere- There are after all no frontiers or boundaries that can halt their wider proliferation. Whether the issue we consider is political  economic or social  whether it pertains to peace  underdevelopment or the environment  national or unilateral action alone would not suffice· The action to be taken must be concerted and must involve all States.Since last we met  the dialogue on nuclear disarmament has advanced. Unhappily  however  the expectations that had been engendered with regard to international economic co-operation have not materialized; and the principle of multilateralism remains to be fully embraced. It is salutary to observe  however  that the willingness of regional States to solve conflict situations in their areas and to promote economic and functional co-operation  has strengthened.If the results of our efforts have been uneven  one thing remains constant. It is the yearning of the vast majority of mankind for a peaceful international environment and for the creation of conditions that can best secure and sustain their economic development.In the area of the international economy  world output last year  as a measure of our combined productive effort  remained positive; and inflation continued its downward trend. These developments encouraged the expectation of further improvements in the performance of the world economy and of a better quality of life for the many in the developing countries. Sadly  these favourable indications have not been maintained  as output is not growing at the anticipated rate. As a consequence  there is increased concern over the prospects for developing countries and the ability of the world economy to withstand further stress.Current trends therefore leave us little option but to maintain a troubled view of the condition of international trade? a factor which is so critical to sustained recovery. Not only is its rate or expansion disappointing but there is the real possibility of its contraction  in the light of the intensification of protectionist measures. Indeed  Guyana knows only too well of the damage that protectionist measures could cause to exports. It has seen the access of one of its major exports  sugar  to an important market  progressively reduced in a short period of time· The intensification of these measures by industrialized countries is inevitably injurious to the best efforts of development- I venture to say that those who harbour the thought that they are protected from its worst repercussions may awaken too late to its real adversity. Similarly  as regards the terms of trade for primary commodities  the situation is still far from hopeful  despite the upturn in the prices of some commodities and the recent multilateral attempts to salvage international co-operation in this area.Last year  in one of its resolutions  the General Assembly placed in its proper perspective the requirements for resolving the debt problem. Those decisions represented an attempt to grapple with a difficult and politically sensitive problem and promised a more positive outlook. Current economic trends  however  especially those relating to output and trade  reinforce apprehension about the extent to which the goal of alleviating the debt burden can be realized. Despite this  we need to build on that determination in the light of the emerging appreciation of the full dimensions of the effect of the problem on national and international policies.Beyond that  the current difficulties in the global economy warrant a more concerted approach by the entire community. Indeed  what is required now is the urgent realization that  in economic and social matters  prosperity is very much like peace - integral and indivisible. It is clear that  unless the international milieu favours equitable development among all nations  the welfare of all of us is in jeopardy. Yet the imperatives of co-operation have not been fully heeded. Policies continue to be pursued by some without full consideration of the situation prevailing in the rest of the world- Nowhere is this more evident than in relation to the international monetary system. There remains  unfortunately  an avoidance of global solutions. Instead  selective but limited reforms are pursued. Some of these are in the right direction. In relation to the International Monetary Fund  for example  the mix of policies should be more widely varied in recognition of differing conditions between countries. Where unanticipated or unavoidable factors give rise to adverse growth trends  resources should be made available to support growth programmes; and finally  more flexibility should be employed with regard to quantitative targets and longer periods allowed for demand adjustment policies to take effect.The reforms  however  need to be extensive. Unless this happens  the principles of interdependence and mutual responsibility would be further eroded. A  re-commitment to multilateralism is essential to any solution of the current economic crisis.One positive development in this respect has been the resolve of developing countries to encourage and expand economic co-operation among themselves. Progress in this direction is appreciable  as was evident at the recent Pyongyang meeting of non-aligned countries. The United Nations system can play a valuable role in assisting the promotion of economic co-operation among developing countries. We urge it to do so. The threats to international peace are manifold. These include not only underdevelopment  to which I have alluded  but also regional conflicts and  importantly  adversarial relations between the super-Powers. That is why the improvement in relations between the super-Powers constitutes a significant step towards the diminution of tension and the creation of an atmosphere propitious to the improvement of interstate relations. In this regard  we applaud the efforts being made by the United States and the Soviet Union to agree on the removal from their arsenals of certain categories of nuclear weapons. Such an accord may not be significant in quantitative terms. It can  however  if pursued with sincerity  represent the beginning of a process which could lead to further agreements on nuclear disarmament. Hopefully  it can also usher in a new relationship between the two States  based not on confrontation but on healthy competition within the framework of collective international co-operation  and based upon respect for each other's social system.The United Nations must however maintain total and complete disarmament as an issue of central concern. Preparations for the third special session on disarmament must proceed apace to benefit from the current momentum and to ensure that the outcome goes beyond the meagre results achieved in the past.If all these efforts are successful  resources which are allocated to the preparation for war would naturally be released for other purposes. Such resources should be used for development  especially of the developing countries. In this context Guyana believes that  limited though they were  the results of the recently concluded Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development provide a basis for further dialogue and agreement. We urge all  each Member State  to join in that dialogue. In the meantime  however  conflicts continue to prevail in several regions of the world. Some of them have so far proved intractable. Others offer solutions on the basis of dialogue and negotiation which take into account the interests of the concerned States.To speak of the region to which Guyana belongs - Latin America and the Caribbean - the process of a political negotiated solution is now in the ascendancy. That this is so is due in no small measure to the undaunted diplomacy of the Contadora and Support Groups. The agreement signed by the five Presidents of Central America in Guatemala  following the initiative of President Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica  if scrupulously implemented and universally respected  will offer a reasonable chance for peace in the region. We therefore urge all concerned parties  both inside and outside the region  to respect the Guatemala agreement and to co-operate fully in its faithful execution. The agreement is of transcendental significance  and we believe that the United Nations can play a helpful role in the process of implementation.Earlier this year the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  at a special ministerial meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau held in the capital of my country  devoted much attention to the situation in Central America and issued the Georgetown appeal for peace in the region. In his welcoming address  the President of Guyana  Comrade Hugh Desmond Hoyte  observed that ""peace in Central America is essential to the security of the whole region"". Guyana therefore welcomes the positive developments that have since taken place.It is not without interest that in their attempt to implement the various accords the parties have issued an appeal for immediate economic and technical assistance. This call is in clear recognition that the situation in the area stems not from ideological differences but from the chronic social and economic condition which the States in this region have for so long endured.Central America is therefore in .many ways a microcosm of the third world which  by and large  suffers from structural deficiencies and which  as a consequence  is generally prone to upheaval. The linkage between stability and underdevelopment is  in Guyana's view  self-evident. It is not difficult to see that many political crises originate from essentially volatile economic and social conditions.The search for political negotiated solutions to conflicts is being pursued in other regions. The Involvement of the United Nations in such negotiations is a source of satisfaction to Guyana. In this regard  we commend the Secretary-General of our Organization for his tireless efforts in the discharge of the many mandates with which he has been entrusted. We wish him every success.The continuation of the war between Iran and Iraq is a source of distress to us. We support the most recent resolution of the Security Council  which calls inter alia for a cease-fire  and other efforts which enlarge the prospects for peace in the region.As regards the Middle East  the quickening of the process towards the convening of the international peace conference  involving the Palestine Liberation Organization  is urgently required if peace is to come to the region. For this peace to be just and durable  the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland in Palestine must be respected  as must the principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force  and the right of all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries. Likewise  Guyana wishes to encourage the Secretary-General in his patient search for a settlement in Cyprus. The causes of strife  including the continuing presence of foreign troops  must be fully addressed.Similarly  in Korea  where a long divided people yearn for peaceful reunification  efforts must be intensified to pursue the promising signs of an eventual reconciliation.Guyana also supports the efforts of the United Nations in bringing about political negotiated solutions to the situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. These solutions must be in consonance with well-known principles of this Organization  especially those relating to sovereignty  territorial integrity and self-determination.Turning to the situation in South Africa  I am reminded that during his trial on the trumped-up charge of treason. Nelson Mandela declared that he was fighting ""for a society of equal opportunity"". That still remains the objective of the oppressed masses in South Africa. For 75 years they have maintained a resolute and passionate struggle  first seeking change through peaceful means  but later driven by the intransigence of the racist regime in Pretoria to engage in armed struggle. The overall struggle of the South African people has been supported by various States and other sectors and forces in the international community.Since the last major initiative by the Commonwealth to bring about peaceful change was contemptuously rebuffed and sabotaged by Pretoria  there has been no amelioration of the situation. In fact it has worsened. And the state of emergency has become the norm.An increasing number of erstwhile supporters within South Africa of so-called separate development are now challenging the efficacy of the system of apartheid. Its collapse is inevitable. At this particular conjuncture  it therefore becomes even more Important to support fully the South African freedom fighters and to continue to give material support to the front-line States  against which Pretoria is prone to unleash its military machine. It is also necessary to strengthen and expand existing arrangements  including sanctions  in order to further isolate South Africa  and weaken and eventually eradicate apartheid.This same abominable system o£ apartheid and plunder also holds the people of Namibia captive. This Organization has long determined the steps to be taken for Namibia's liberation. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will  if implemented in all its aspects  speedily and effectively achieve that objective. The scoff laws in South Africa have however remained intransigent. Unfortunately  this attitude is not being discouraged by other States which have a vested interest in the exploitation of Namibia's rich resources and in supporting South Africa's so-called strategic position. Victory for the struggling masses of South Africa and Namibia is not in doubt. We owe it to them  both in this Organization and outside it  to bring the strongest pressure to bear on the racist regime of Pretoria for an early demission from power. In anticipation of the peoples’ victory  we should seek as well  as my President counselled at the eighth Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement  in Harare  to assist the people of South Africa and Namibia in preparing themselves to take their rightful place in the international community and to enjoy the full fruits of their independence.There are also other issues which lend themselves to concerted global action if realistic solutions are to be found. One of those is the protection of the environment. The report of the World Commission on Environment and Development now before the Assembly calls for an immediate return to multilateralism. As the Commission's report states:""The unity of human needs requires a functioning multilateral system that respects the democratic principle of consent and accepts that not only the Earth but also the world is one"". (A/42/427  para. 53)The awareness of the fragility of the eco-system which has been so dramatically demonstrated in the report must  in Guyana's view  inevitably give new meaning to the concept of collective economic security. The arguments are persuasive and should lend urgency to joint action in resolving the overwhelming problems now confronting us.In devising appropriate programmes for action  however  there is a need to ensure that developing countries are not penalized for their co-operation; nor should their right to a balanced economic growth be sacrificed. Indeed  when it is considered that the eco-system of the developing countries is necessary for the welfare of the developed world  it is not far-fetched to contemplate some form of compensation for this clear benefit. I urge the relevant committee of the Assembly to give due consideration to this idea as we endeavour to manage the environment properly and thereby ensure the survival of the human race.Another issue of concern to all of us has already proved susceptible to global co-operation. I refer here to our efforts to combat the dangers of drug abuse  a matter which needs to be addressed in all its aspects - production  trafficking and  importantly  consumption. The results achieved at the Vienna Conference earlier this year demonstrate the value of collective action. The follow-up measures which these results require should not be allowed to languish. We must reinforce joint and national endeavours to find disincentives to the continued production and use of noxious substances.We have begun the task of reform of the Organization in acknowledgement of today's realities. The prime objective must always be efficiency and the need to make the best use of resources in the interest of all Member States  what will create difficulties is if the process of adjustment is used to achieve or maintain narrow political advantage. Adjustment must be in the interest of mankind; it must be done with a human face  sensitive to the needs of suffering people and responsive to the imperative of equitable development.Over the years there has been a maturation of the concept of an interdependent world. Nation States themselves are undertaking programmes of structural adjustment  not only to promote the welfare of their own people but also to harmonize their relationships in the wider international community.For this process of structural adjustment to be fully effective  new concepts of national and collective security would have to be formulated. In such a scheme of things  confrontation should give way to co-operation  and the needs of humanity should be our foremost concern. Put another way  the war ethic must be replaced by one rooted in peace  multilateralism strengthened and greater reliance placed on dialogue and negotiation for conflict resolution  in this context the importance of sovereign equality cannot be overstressed since it should be the axis on which a democratic system revolves.Enormous obstacles will be encountered in furthering the process. We should not however desist from pursuing our objective  which indeed has become imperative. Guyana is fully committed to this goal. The prospects are exciting. Let us go forward together."
"62",2987,"HND",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the Government of Honduras I extend to you  Sir  sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Your personal qualities and your knowledge of this world Organization guarantee wise and successful guidance of the Assembly's work. We should also like to express our appreciation to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  the representative of Bangladesh  who preceded you in your important functions.To the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  I wish once again to express my Government's great appreciation for his outstanding work in charge of the Organization. The democratic Government of Honduras  presided over by José Azcona  constantly reaffirms its commitment to peace  development and democracy.It should be seen as an encouraging sign that in Central America  torn by violence and political radicalisation  ray country is fighting resolutely for political freedom and economic and social well-being. This is so because the Honduran Government has set as its primary objectives improved living standards for the people and the consolidation and development of democracy as a system of life and of Government.These goals are faithfully reflected in the foreign policy of Honduras. Just as domestically  at the governmental and the private levels  we are endeavouring by peaceful means to overcome the obstacles of underdevelopment  internationally  we are endeavouring to resolve our differences with other countries by resorting to the peaceful means of settling disputes contained in international law. President José Azcona  in his annual message to the National Congress of the Republic  at the beginning of this year stated the following:""I reaffirm to you that peaceful goals are the standards by which our Government operates. Hence we proclaim that dialogue and the means of international law must prevail for settling disputes among nations. This is how we resolved our border disputes with Guatemala and Nicaragua in the past  and that is why at the present time we have placed our trust in the International Court of Justice in its consideration of the border problem that is pending with the Republic of El Salvador.""My Government is entirely willing to support any peaceful settlement for the political  ideological and military crisis in Central America. It is for this reason that we have offered and continue to offer full support for negotiations being conducted by the Contadora Group sponsored by Panama  Venezuela  Colombia and Mexico  with its Support Group made up of Argentina  Uruguay  Brazil and Peru.""The Government of Honduras is convinced that resort to the peaceful means of settling disputes is the beat guarantee for the maintenance of peace and harmony in the international arena.My Government notes with just concern that  rather than diminishing  international crises are increasing  emerging one after the other and lasting longer. The use of violence and force seems to be encouraged by certain states with hegemonistic designs  thus diminishing the goal of peace to a simple balance of power. International tension continues to challenge the ability of the United Nations to give effect to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Failure to resolve pending conflicts and the alarming shift of those conflicts to and polarization of the developing countries are true tests of the machinery for world peace and security. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the United Nations in order to strengthen international peace and security.My Government reaffirms its faith in the world legal order and believes that it provides the best way of putting international standards above the particular interests of each State.Honduras notes with concern the lack of progress with regard to disarmament and the reduction of arsenals. The possession of large amounts of nuclear arras  on which the present balance of power - or terror - is based  has not provided security  but rather brought us ever closer to the destruction of mankind.Therefore arms limitation cannot be thought of in unilateral terms. It requires verifiable agreements  since in the world in which we live the survival of freedom must no longer be based on the nuclear monopoly or nuclear hegemony of a super-Power.Great-Power confrontation is an unending drama. The nuclear-arms race continues  despite the hundreds of resolutions on disarmament adopted by the General Assembly. However  a ray of hope has recently appeared on the horizon. Just as last session we expressed our satisfaction at the Reykjavik summit  which took place in October 1986  so today we express our satisfaction at encouraging signs regarding world peace. The United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are moving nearer to agreement on the elimination of short-range and medium-range missiles in Europe. Other continuing conflicts threaten the system of world peace and security. We reaffirm our conviction that the question of Korea must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and negotiations between South Korea and North Korea. We reiterate that  in accordance with the principle of universality set out in the United Nations Charter  all nations that so desire must be a part of that universality and assume the obligations set forth in the Charter. There must be an end to the legacy of the cold war that persists in the Korean peninsula and in no way contributes to the attainment of international peace and security.My Government supports the General Assembly resolutions on Kampuchea  which call for the withdrawal of all occupying forces and the restoration of the country's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. In this connection  we strongly support the eight-point proposal for a political settlement presented by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.The Government of Honduras condemns the armed occupation of Afghanistan and urges all States to reach a political solution based on the unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan  full respect for Afghanistan's political independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  and the adoption of measures guaranteeing the right of the Afghan people to decide its own future without foreign interference  as well as on the return of Afghan refugees to their homes.In view of the unfortunate events recently experienced by the Government of the Philippines  we express our hope that peace and harmony will return to that country so that it can pursue its development in the framework of freedom  justice and democracy. The persistence of the conflict in the Middle East makes it even more essential to find a lasting solution through the peaceful means of negotiations. Honduras views with satisfaction the efforts of the State of Israel and the Arab Republic of Egypt to promote peace in the region  strengthen the peace treaty between them and resolve outstanding problems. We believe those efforts are important for the prospects of peace with other Arab States.The armed confrontation that has continued for seven years between Iran and Iraq is a very clear example of extreme nationalism compromising world security. That war has not only claimed hundreds of thousands of victims and brought back the use of illegal methods of warfare  but also interfered with freedom of navigation and international maritime trade. My Government hopes that the belligerent States will heed the appeals of the international community for agreement on a peaceful settlement of their conflict.The Government of Honduras takes this opportunity to reiterate its condemnation of the policy of apartheid of the Government of South Africa  which is a clear violation of human rights. Once again the Government of Honduras states its sincere hope that the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  countries with which we have traditionally maintained the best of relations  will settle their differences on the highest level of justice  understanding and peace. The Government of Honduras would be most willing to co-operate - if its efforts might prove useful - in the attainment of a speedy settlement of the dispute. One of the objectives of this Organization is the promotion of its purposes and principles through regional co-operation  which finds its reflection in various kinds of co-operation with other intergovernmental organization. We are pleased that an item has been included in the agenda of the present session relating to co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States. This is the result of an initiative by Honduras  with the support of many other Latin American States. It will surely contribute to the common search for solutions to the many economic  social  cultural and humanitarian problems that beset the international community.Another purpose of the United Nations system is to promote technical co-operation for development/ and that is particularly important for my country. In this regard  the Government of Honduras appreciates the many co-operative efforts being made by organs and bodies within the United Nations system; in particular we appreciate what has been done so effectively in Latin America by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).My Government is pleased that the fourth UNDP programme of co-operation for Honduras has been adopted and will support the activities of those organizations in the area of forestry and agriculture/ public enterprises working in this area and technical co-operation among developing countries. The fourth programme will make it possible for Honduras to give attention to environmental problems and the protection of natural resources as a matter of priority.We should like to emphasize that the adoption by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) of the support programme for the new period is important to Honduras. It will make possible the adoption of a number of basic programmes protecting mothers and children in Honduras. We also welcome the design for the new five-year programme covering population activities.In keeping with its humanitarian traditions  since 1979 about 200 000 persons have sought refuge in Honduras. They have been drawn there by a climate of peace and freedom  having fled from political and social violence in their countries. About 47 000 of those refugees have been receiving assistance from the international community - they deserve its recognition - and from other organizations.My country has also received much assistance at the international level from other friendly countries to help refugees. But the flow of refugees continues and will continue until a climate propitious to their return home has been created. The promotion and respect of human rights is one of the primary purposes of the United Nations. However  the international community continues to witness barbaric acts violating human rights  freedoms  man's dignity and fundamental rights. It is therefore urgent that the international community take concerted action and wage a broad campaign against terrorism  which threatens domestic and international peace and can by no means be justified.My Government is convinced that those nations professing faith in human rights have a legal and moral obligation to protect them and to condemn the countries which inexcusably and repeatedly violate them. Once again in the United Nations we shall consider the item entitled ""The situation in Central America: threats to international peace and security and peace initiatives""  which has already been the subject of a number of General Assembly resolutions. We believe that to carry out a proper analysis of the crisis in Central America it is important to understand its origins and political and social development. It is necessary to understand the colonial  federal and republican backgrounds of Central America which have led to the present economic  social  political and security situation. The accumulation of those events in the history of Central America has led to the social tension and internal struggles besetting the countries of the region today  and now the crisis has come to the periphery of East-West confrontation.Internal conflicts in certain countries have led to a massive exodus of refugees  whose repatriation must be undertaken in keeping with the commitments to national reconciliation. This cannot be delayed  lest economic and social problems become more acute. Of late  one of the primary receiving countries of refugees has been Honduras. The persistence of these internal conflicts has caused irreparable harm to economies  productive investments  and the social and security balance in neighbouring countries; armed opposition movements have tried to use border areas as sanctuaries and all too frequently those actions nave led to claims  protests  tensions and even armed raids such as those suffered by Honduras in March and December 1986. Those raids have prompted the Honduran army to expel aggressor forces from our national territory.The arms race is another force disruptive to peace in Central America; it too has led to growing insecurity in the region. The Government of Honduras has insisted that the arms race be halted  that armaments be limited and military forces reduced - all under effective international control. Given the abnormal situation now prevailing in Central America  Honduras has endeavoured to assume a dispassionate and thoughtful position in its relations with neighbouring countries. Our foreign policy has been realistic  forthright and free of undue passion.In January 1987 the countries of Central America were honoured by the visit of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS)   who met with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries of the Contadora and Support Groups. Those distinguished visitors informed the Central American heads of State of their concern at the crisis afflicting Central America. The Honduran Government/ which fully appreciated the visit  expressed its willingness to maintain and consolidate peace by all legal means.On that occasion  the Secretaries-General indicated that their organizations would co-operate in the settlement of internal disputes and accompanying regional tensions. Their offer was greatly appreciated and proved to be an important contribution towards regional normalization.When the President of Costa Rica proposed a new peace initiative in February 1987  my Government supported it as a suitable and timely method for maintaining peace in Central America through political negotiation. We also recommended that the peace initiative be implemented in two stages - at the national level  in relation to agreements concerning national reconciliation  that is  on a cease-fire  amnesty  democratisation  supervision and control) and at the international level with the participation of the Contadora Group and the Support Group  to seek agreement on the following: the cessation of military assistance to insurgents; the non-use of territory for the launching of acts of aggression against other States; disarmament and the relocation of insurgents; limits on and control and reduction of weapons and military advisers; the arms trade; international verification and control; and co-operation on political  economic and security questions.On 1 August  at the initiative of Honduras  the Foreign Ministers of Central America and the Contadora Group met once again  this time in Tegucigalpa  in order to continue efforts to normalize the situation in the region. We considered the Arias plan  modifications suggested by the Governments and the document entitled ""Proposals by Honduras regarding peace initiatives for Central America""  which attempted to harmonize the political objectives of democratisation included in the plan with a Honduran recommendation that mediation by the Contadora Group be reactivated so that agreements on problems of security could be reached.That meeting  which represented a milestone in the peace process  culminated in the signing by the Central American Presidents  on 7 August of this year in Guatemala City  of the document entitled ""Procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America"". We are pleased that many of the proposals by Honduras regarding peace initiatives in Central America have been included in the Esquipulas II agreement  including that for active mediation by the Contadora Group in security matters.Three important meetings have been held regarding execution of the commitments embodied in the Guatemala accord - the first in San Salvador  where an executive committee was set up; the second in Caracas  where the International Committee on Verification and Follow-up was created; and the third in Managua  where a framework for action by both committees was decided.The Executive Committee  composed of the Presidents of Central America and invested with the power to regulate  implement and enforce compliance with the commitments entered into under the Guatemala agreement at the recent meeting in Managua  endeavoured to define principles  guidelines and orientation for the work of the International Committee on Verification and Follow-up  which was assigned the task of enforcing the various commitments entered into by the Governments. Consequently  the Executive Committee will see to it that the International Committee on Verification will have the support and facilities it needs to carry out Its task.Indeed  it is up to the Committee on Verification to ensure the simultaneous implementation of the agreements on amnesty  including those on irregular forces and political prisoners  a cease-fire  democratisation  cessation of assistance to insurgent forces and the non-use of territory to carry out acts of aggression against other States.The number and nature of commitments entered into are not the same for all the parties  for these depend on the political and social situation of each country. Some Governments are called upon to implement all the commitments. Others  such as Honduras  which has avoided much of the social unrest affecting its neighbours  have entered into those parts of the agreement that apply specifically to them.Central America  by means of the Executive Committee  now has within its control the process of a return to normalcy in countries suffering from civil war and bilateral and multilateral tension.In order to ensure the success of the process of peace and detente in the region  it is essential that irregular forces fully accept the Guatemala agreement and act in accordance with it. This applies to those forces operating in Nicaragua and El Salvador. After irregular forces publicly accept the agreement  the Governments of Nicaragua and El Salvador must take all necessary action to agree on and implement an effective cease-fire within a constitutional framework.All the Central American countries must ensure that their territory not be used for acts of aggression against other countries  in regard to material aid as well as to moral and propaganda considerations. Again  this is an obligation that must be fulfilled by States members of the International Committee on Verification and Follow-up and by those States expressing an interest in efforts to normalize the situation in Central America.The Central American countries having made an international appeal for the cessation of military assistance to irregular forces and insurgents  we trust that it will be accepted and complied with  in good faith  by all the States involved in that type of activity  including those which have stubbornly denied their involvement despite proof to the contrary. The restoration of the equilibrium of security in Central America depends upon our ability to keep out of the East-West conflict. We must recognize that if the regional crisis were not so complex it would not have taken five years of patient negotiations and the contribution of 13 countries and 2 international organizations  1 regional and 1 world-wide  to bring about its return to normalcy Honduras is participating in good faith in the process agreed to in Guatemala  a process based on mutual trust  arising from the premise that all Governments will abide by the commitments they have entered into  as agreed.The Central American homeland demands democratic peace. For that reason  we trust that the principles of good faith and mutual trust underlying the Guatemala agreement will be strengthened. That can be done by putting an end to certain international juridical situations that represent an unjustifiable threat to such principles and that are incompatible with certain international treaties provided for in the agreement.An essential part of Esquipulas II is an appeal for the cessation of hostilities. Those Governments of the States that are at present the victims of activities carried out by irregular or insurgent groups have committed themselves to whatever action is necessary to implement a cease-fire within a constitutional framework.An effective cease-fire is essential for the attainment of peace in those countries suffering from civil war. Once the hostilities are over citizens will  as an inevitable result of socio-political realities  return to normal civil life and take an active part in the democratisation of their countries.Once the hostilities are over  refugees will return to their countries of origin and their homes and give their families the fruit of their work  and the quiet home life that is the cement required to build national tranquillity. Once the hostilities are over  the tensions among neighbouring countries produced by such refugee movements will come to an end. Once the hostilities are over  there will no longer be any need for external assistance provided for the purpose of destabilizing Governments.The situation in Central America is quite unlike the situation anywhere else in the world  the crisis there should not be viewed as an international conflict in the sense of hostilities among nations. Its essential characteristic is the existence of long-drawn-out civil wars in the region that have given rise to tensions among Governments. Those civil wars must therefore be brought to an end  for they are a threat to peace and security in the region.May God enlighten the leaders of our countries and the leaders of the irregular forces now involved in those civil wars. May they enter into a patriotic dialogue  and may they reach agreement on an effective cease-fire that will lead to national reconciliation."
"63",3056,"HTI",42,1987,"﻿I am very pleased to extend to you  Mr. President  my congratulations on your election to guide the work of this forty-second session of the General Assembly. I wish you full success in the performance of your important and delicate tasks·The participation for the first time of the head of the executive branch of the Haitian Government in the work of the General Assembly has a twofold significance. It should be seen first and foremost as a reaffirmation of our devotion to and support for the objectives of the United Nations  which are entirely in line with those of the National Council of Government over which it is my honour to preside. It is also a special tribute to this Organization  which  through the Commission on Human Rights and other agencies of the United Nations system  has for a long time concerned itself with the crisis that has afflicted our country for almost 30 years.It is thus fitting that I should express  on behalf of the Haitian people  all our admiration and our deep gratitude to the tireless Secretary-General Mr. Javier Perez de Cuéllar  who  as he himself said  went to Haiti to demonstrate his concern over the urgent situation in our country and to bring us a message of comfort and encouragement. His stay with us was unfortunately all too brief  but it did enable him to judge for himself the scope of the task facing the National Council of Government  which  having come to power in particular circumstances  suddenly found itself confronting a heavy burden of economic failure  shaky political and social structures and  what is more  a wave of demands by the people whose legitimacy could not be questioned.There are indeed very many essential and urgent needs to be met  very many injustices to be corrected  very many failing structures to be rebuilt and new institutions to be established. That is the task to which we are devoting ourselves  convinced as we are that it must have priority if the transition to democracy is to be ensured and the unity and integrity of the nation is to be safeguarded. No effort has been too great as we strive to achieve that aim. In that respect  we are entitled to be pleased with the value  the scope and the consistency of the work that has been done - work which  at the very least  is remarkable and meets the requirements of a situation that demands change  but without confusion or chaos.Thus  at the political level a set of measures has been adopted and appropriate structures have been established in order to ensure the active participation of all segments of society in the political life of the nation. For the first time in Haiti's history  the rural masses - which make up more than 70 per cent of the population - have elected their representatives to the Administrative Councils of the Communal Sections. That is one of the measures of which the National Council of Government can be proud; it meets the requirements of social justice for a peasantry that had for too long been kept on the sidelines of public affairs. Truly free unions now exist. There is complete freedom of expression and association  and a very large number of political parties are functioning without hindrance  discrimination or ideological considerations.In a word  there is a new political system based on a liberal Constitution with the following main features; there is a balance among the three powers) there is decentralization} the term of office of the President is limited to five years  and he cannot be re-elected; fundamental rights and freedoms have been strengthened an independent body to organize elections has been set up. Under the established time-table  elections will take place at all levels  with the result that on 7 February 1988 power will pass to the Haitian chosen by the people themselves  without any form of interference. We should be deluding ourselves  however  if we thought a legal framework was enough to guarantee the existence of a democratic society. Disorders  unjustified rebellion  lack of discipline  blindness  intolerance  personal ambitions  ' irresponsibility  a complete lack of patriotism  the temptation to yield to anarchy and the totalitarianism of others - all are threats to this democratic enterprise. However  our faith in the future of democracy  which we feel cannot be turned back  is matched only by the determination of the people to decide its own future and take charge of its destiny.On the economic plane  in 20 months of management  significant recovery measures have been implemented in a truly critical situation. Without losing sight of the structural handicaps of the Haitian economy  which are typical of the least advanced countries  it has proved necessary and urgent to correct internal and external imbalances  to improve public finances and to restore the confidence of investors both national and foreign. In a word  it has proved necessary to create the conditions needed to restore the economy after many years of stagnation and even backwardness.To this end  an interim development programme has been launched. Regrettably  because of its dimensions and its objectives that programme may seem limited  considering the extent and complexity of the structural problems facing our country. But one should recall that the rate of unemployment in Haiti is roughly 50 per cent of the active population and the rate of illiteracy approaches 80 pet cent  while the per capita income is approximately $320 per annum. Even so  and notwithstanding its modest dimensions  the programme is important in that it covers many and varied areas such as health  education  public finances  and so on. Thus its value cannot be questioned. If it is to be implemented  the programme requires more than national efforts alone; it requires substantial  sustained support from the international community.At this crossroads  we must say we regret we have been unable to mobilize the resources Haiti had hoped for. Resources have not been raised in accordance with the urgency of the circumstancesIn spite of everything  as we work towards our goals  we must at the same time develop a human sense of justice  a sense of mutual respect and self-confidence  and we must trust others; indeed  we must cultivate the values of dialogue  concerted effort and tolerance  and at the same time we must create conditions conducive to progress. If we do these things  we shall reach an important stage on the way towards the accomplishment of our democratic ideals.At its forty-second session the General Assembly will be dealing with serious problems which are often inseparable one from another and that concern international peace  security and co-operation.As emerges from the enlightened report of the Secretary-General  an examination of the state of the world reveals the dangers posed by the arms race and the continuation of crises in the Middle East  in Africa  in Asia and in the Americas  which undeniably present many challenges the international community must meet if it is to build world peace and ensure world security.At the same time  tensions are Increasing everywhere. Acts of terrorism are increasingly frequent; there are repeated attempts at murder and the taking of hostages. Such acts are a manifestation of the kinds of crises that have existed in international relations for nearly four decades. This unleashing of violence which affects all the continents of the world on the economic level and causes serious Imbalances which the third world must face  has taken a heavy toll. Only very few countries of the third world have been spared. As for the most vulnerable and most backward countries  their development lags at least one decade behind the others  as was stressed recently in a report from the world Bank. In the circumstances  how can we fail to face such problems as the collapse of commodity prices  the ceiling on the flow of public assistance and the debt problem  all of which have halted the growth of the countries of the third world?  The Republic of Haiti is firmly convinced that international security is one and indivisible and concerns all States and all peoples. Consequently  it attaches the greatest importance to the role of the United Nations  which must be strengthened if it is truly to be a centre for harmonizing common efforts to ensure the maintenance of peace and security and the strengthening of international co-operation. Hence the need to end those situations that  in addition to threatening international peace and security  undermine the credibility of our Organization.This applies to the Middle East  where the persistence of the conflict and the delay in beginning a negotiating process have only spurred on the cycle of distrust and violence. The bloody tragedy in Lebanon has highlighted the need to redouble the efforts to find a solution to this crisis that has already lasted too long.Haiti believes that the fact that the provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 33 8 (1973) have been ignored by some has certainly contributed to the continuance of a highly explosive situation. We feel that the time is ripe for the convening of the international conference on the Middle East  which could lay the foundations for an overall settlement that would take into account Israel's right to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries  the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to a homeland like other peoples  and the need to restore Lebanon's sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity.Regarding the war between Iran and Iraq  Haiti welcomes the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which calls for  among other things  an immediate cease-fire by the belligerents. We earnestly hope that the implementation of that resolution will pave the way for a negotiated settlement. Similarly  in the case of Kampuchea and Afghanistan  we continue to support United Nations efforts to facilitate the search for a political settlement guaranteeing the withdrawal of foreign forces and allowing the Kampuchean and Afghan peoples to determine their own future freely and without foreign intervention or interference.We reaffirm also our support for the territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty of Cyprus and shall continue to support the Secretary-General's efforts in this context. The Haitian people sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people to reunification by peaceful means and hope that the coming Olympic Games in Seoul will mark an important stage on the road to that objective.Africa  to which Haiti remains attached by so many bonds  is waging its final struggles to free itself from the forces of colonialism and racism. It deserves the international community's fullest support in this struggle. We are firmly convinced that the persistence of the apartheid regime in South Africa is one of the greatest challenges of the end of this century. Once again we call for the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the racist regime in the hope that finally the South African people will regain their freedom in a United  democratic  multiracial society.We are also opposed to the continuing illegal occupation of Namibia and reaffirm our full commitment to the cause of the brother people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Further efforts must be made to ensure Namibia's complete independence  in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. We are deeply concerned by the confrontation in Africa between Libya and Chad. Chad  a developing country which  like ours  is one of the least advanced  wants only peace within its rightful national borders and with its neighbours. Here again  we hope that with the active support of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations common sense will eventually carry the day and that Chad  with its sovereignty over all its territory restored  will regain peace  which will allow it to devote itself exclusively to its economic and social development.As regards the situation in Central America we hail the peace plan adopted at the meeting of Heads of State  pointing the way to a negotiated political settlement with the co-operation of the parties involved. We find that a particularly welcome event because we have always believed that a solution to the problems of Central America could be found only by the peoples of the region themselves. In this connection we cannot fail to pay tribute to President Arias of Costa Rica for his timely action following upon the deserving efforts of the Contadora Group. His courageous efforts in support of peace have earned our deep admiration and gratitude.In tandem with the worsening world economic crisis and its negative impact on the developing countries  the arms race - and more specifically the nuclear-arms race  has reached unprecedented proportions. Hence disarmament must become one of our priority objectives. That is why we welcome the success of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America on the elimination of intermediate-range missiles. That agreement  when implemented  will represent a decisive step towards the global disarmament plan we earnestly desire. In the event  we hope that putting an end to the enormous waste of resources brought about by arms expenditures will  to some extent  offset the corresponding decline in funds for public development assistance  which have fallen well short of the goals set 25 years ago by the first United Nations Development Decade. For the maintenance of genuine international peace is undoubtedly linked to a realignment of international relations that offers real prospects to a third world burdened by debt and dwindling resources.At a time when the Republic of Haiti is entering upon a decisive stage in its history  it wishes to reaffirm its faith in the values embodied in the United Nations. It remains convinced that this Organization  so long as it enjoys the political support of Member States  will continue to make its irreplaceable contribution to the search for appropriate solutions to problems of all kinds caused by accelerating change in international society and by the many challenges posed at all levels in a world with a population of more than 5 billion human beings  more than two-thirds of whom live in the third world.In solidarity with all peoples and all mankind  the Republic of Haiti will give every support to all steps taken by the Organization for the betterment of man; promoting and guaranteeing his rights and fostering the establishment of more balanced and fraternal relations among peoples. Hence we pledge to maintain and strengthen  with all nations  relations of friendship and co-operation based on the principles of sovereign equality  independence  mutual respect  non-interference  and the right of every people to choose in complete freedom the path it wishes to take for its economic and social development.Finally  we reaffirm our confidence in the future of the United Nations and in its mission to secure the triumph of justice  solidarity and world peace."
"64",3102,"HUN",42,1987,"﻿Allow me  Sir  to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am especially pleased by your election since the relations between our countries are close and friendly and our co-operation is fruitful. I can assure you that in your high and responsible post you can count upon the full co-operation and support of the delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic Our delegation  guided by the policy of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic  which is in full conformity with the aims and principles of the United Nations Charter  wishes to contribute actively to the success of the work of the present session of the General Assembly as well.The conditions for widening the dialogue and developing practical co-operation among States seem more favourable now than they were during the forty-first session of the General Assembly. The positive trends in the international situation have somewhat strengthened  though grave tensions also persist.The dialogue that has been resumed and become constant between the Soviet Union and the United States of America points in the direction of reduced international tension and strengthened confidence between States  The progress made in their bilateral disarmament talks gives rise to hopes and may induce far-reaching favourable changes that would usher in a new period in the history of international relations  leading us on to the twenty-first century. This imposes increased responsibility on the two leading great Powers. The entire community of nations rightly expects that by accepting mutual compromises they will steer the course of international developments in the desired direction. However  the most important lesson of our foreign policy activity in recent years shows that every country  irrespective of its size should assume a share of that responsibility and do its utmost to contribute towards easing international tension and strengthening co-operation between nations.We maintain that an excellent possibility of doing so is afforded by the United Nations  which is  within the system of international relations  an irreplaceable forum for co-operation among countries of different size  with different social systems and at different levels of economic development. We are deeply convinced that the world Organization still has considerable possibilities yet to be explored and a great potential yet to be mobilized for implementing the noble objectives and principles of the Charter. To avert and remove once and for all the danger of a nuclear catastrophe  to halt the arms race and adopt effective disarmament measures  to build just economic relations free from discrimination and to create living conditions worthy of man in the twentieth century - these are tasks for the nations and for the international community in which  we believe  the United Nations and its agencies should show more initiative and play a more active and pioneering role. It is this awareness that prompts my Government  together with other socialist countries  when we emphasize the need for the General Assembly to take steps towards bringing about a comprehensive system of international peace and security. The aim of this initiative is to lay the basis for broad international co-operation in inter-State relations to replace the present confrontation and mistrust.In our nuclear age  the military and non-military challenges to the security of the world  the complexity and intricacy of international problems and the interdependence of States call for entirely new approaches to questions of security. The relevant discussions at the forty-first session of the General Assembly allowed some conclusions to be drawn which should form an integral part of security policy concepts in our time. The events of the intervening period have reinforced the conclusion that national and international security can no longer be separated and that neither can be preserved in a lasting way to the detriment of or in subordination to the other. Given the realities of our age  no single country can rely exclusively on military-technical means for guaranteeing its security. This can be achieved only by political means and by joint action. No single country has an exclusive right to security. The creation of a new structure of security policies presupposes the active participation of all States  whatever their size or political and social system. It is impossible in our day to remove the threats to common security except by comprehensive management of the different problems  namely  those which emerge separately or in conjunction in the political  economic  humanitarian  human rights and ecological fields. In our world  interwoven as it is with mutual dependence  this conclusion is on the way to becoming a cliché  but the manner of implementation  the course of action to follow  appears to have won less general acceptance.The responses so far to our initiative reaffirm our opinion that the objective pursued is right. Taking due account of the interrelationships between different areas and with the involvement of the States Members of the United Nations  joint efforts should be made towards elaborating a viable system which  resting on the Charter of the United Nations  may provide a firm long-term basis for balanced development of international relations. Such a system should be based on the democratisation of international relations and world politics} reduction of the role of military strength and its possible relegation as a security policy concept; the creation of conditions and the elaboration and application of an institutional system and rules of conduct necessary for a political settlement of international conflicts; joint solutions to global world economic and ecological problems  and the achieving of a fuller measure of human rights.How are these goals to be attained?On the one hand  the framework and mechanism of this new system of security should be devised and  on the other  action based on a broad consensus should be taken concurrently on whatever concrete issue is ripe for solution. We consider that such action is possible even on several global problems. I refer to international action against terrorism  drug abuse and diseases such as AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)  among other things.Consideration of the relevant agenda item in the light of such an approach might give an opportunity for a substantive dialogue on both the conceptual aspects and the concrete problems of international security and make it possible for concrete courses of action to be charted on the basis of mutual interest and consensus.The core and substance of activity in this direction is that no State or group of States may claim a monopoly on action  for the related problems are shared and their solution  too  can be promoted only by joint efforts. The encouraging progress made in certain areas of disarmament talks over the past years is a clear and most important indication of positive processes unfolding in international life. The Hungarian People's Republic considers it desirable to ensure  and is doing all it can to see  that the favourable opportunities emerging in the field of disarmament are not missed and that their impact is extended globally through the transmissions of international relations. The fundamental truth of the nuclear age  affirmed by the leadership of both the Soviet Union and the United States  is that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought. The Soviet-United States agreement in principle on the elimination of medium-range and tactical-operational missiles reached recently represents a real breakthrough in the practical implementation of the recognition of that truth. The destruction  under strict international verification measures  of those two categories of nuclear-weapon systems could prove a milestone in nuclear disarmament as a whole. The agreement would create a qualitatively new favourable situation in Europe  and would open the way to new measures aimed at further reducing military confrontation. The favourable political effect of such a highly important step would be felt not only by Europe but also by the world at large.An agreement between the two great Powers on 50 per cent outs in strategic offensive weapons and on concurrent strengthening of the anti-ballistic missile Treaty limiting the building of anti-missile systems would be another major step towards strengthening strategic stability. The Reykjavik summit last year paved the way in this field too for bringing closer positions that still differ on several important issues. The range of problems that continue to impede the successful conclusion of the multilateral negotiations of over 10 years on the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons is also narrowing.In our view there is nothing to support or justify the downgrading of multilateral disarmament talks. Rather  the contrary is true: all of us must jointly seek ways and means to achieve a solution  for which an excellent opportunity will be provided by the forthcoming third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. Europe  where the greatest stockpiles of weapons and armaments  as well as armed forces opposing each other  are concentrated  is a continent of particular relevance to disarmament. Any armed conflict between States of the continent would be likely to plunge the peace and security of the whole world into danger instantly.The Stockholm agreement last year opened a new chapter in the efforts to promote European disarmament and to strengthen confidence and security. Initial experience shows that the measures agreed upon have produced favourable effects in themselves. But  what is perhaps even more important  they serve a useful purpose in paving the way for a significant lowering of the level of military confrontation in Europe. On the basis of the Budapest appeal issued by the States Members of the Warsaw Treaty in June 1986 and the responses thereto of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  23 States participating in the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have  since last February  conducted consultations about the mandate of future negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Europe. Those negotiations must lead to reductions in conventional armed forces down to minimum levels of sufficiency for defence  and thereby to an increase in European stability.The proposed measures constitute a short-term programme of action for disarmament. They should be supplemented by steps creating the foundation for an infrastructure for security in the next century. Without the comprehensive prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests  without the adoption of effective multilateral nuclear-disarmament measures  and without the prevention of the deployment of weapons in outer space  it is hardly possible to think in terms of twenty-first-century security. We are convinced that continuing multilateral negotiating efforts are needed to attain those goals. In the light of the quickening tempo of bilateral and multilateral regional talks  the slow progress or dilatoriness in multilateral disarmament  talks within the United Nations system  particularly in certain areas of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament  are becoming a source of growing concern.By signing the Final Act of Helsinki more than a decade ago  the States of Europe expressed their conviction that security cannot be built solely by military means  and that appropriate political  economic and humanitarian conditions are equally indispensable for security. There is no room for doubt that the process of European security and co-operation is an indispensable framework for the maintenance of East-West dialogue and the development of co-operation.Hungary has a vested interest in the continuation and intensification of this process. The large number of proposals submitted at the Vienna follow-up meeting is another indication of the vivid interest shown by the participating States in the steady development of co-operation in Europe. This is evidenced by the fact that States belonging to different groups of countries and having different social systems have identical goals on several issues.Hungary  which is situated in the zone of direct contact between countries with different social systems  is bound by myriad traditional ties to the European States  Despite the differences in ideology and socio-economic system  the countries of Europe have established useful  fruitful and ever broadening co-operation in numerous areas  Hungary's relations with the countries of Western Europe likewise testify to the recognition that novel approaches to international relations  dialogue among States  practical co-operation and action based on mutual respect for divergent interests can be the only path to the future for Europe. That is naturally true for all continents. It would be a significant contribution to just and lasting solutions to regional conflicts and to the elimination of hotbeds of crisis if the General Assembly adopted at the present session a declaration on the enhancement of the effectiveness of the principle of non-use of force in international relations  the draft text of which was elaborated at this year's meetings of the Special Committee established for that purpose  with the active participation of representatives of socialist  non-aligned and Western countries  indeed  the most urgent task of our age is that of banishing the use of force from international relations. The adoption by the General Assembly of the declaration  relevant also to the progressive development of international law  would be more than a symbolic gesture of commitment to strengthening this basic principle embodied in the United Nations Charter.Numerous developments over the past year have strengthened our conviction that the United Nations should play an active and growing role in the relaxation of tension and in the elimination of regional hotbeds of crisis. Effective involvement by the world Organization would considerably increase its chances of taking action in other future issues  while adding to its weight in world politics and enhancing its prestige. The activities of the United Nations  including those of the Security Council and of the Secretary-General and his representatives in the quest for negotiated settlements  the relevant resolutions and mediation efforts  are assuming growing importance in setting good examples. They express the political will of the overwhelming majority of Member States and bring about a mechanism for settlement applicable to any conflict  giving widespread recognition to the principle that a negotiated settlement is the only way out of an armed conflict. That is substantiated also by developments concerning the Iraq-Iran war. Consequently  we welcome and support the active and constructive role of the Secretary-General in the search for a solution to the Gulf crisis that is acceptable to all.Crises can be solved only through a process of comprehensive settlement with the participation of all the parties concerned  and on the basis of the principles of equality and equal security  the principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms of international law. Such efforts can be served most effectively by international conferences to be held under the auspices of the United Nations  whether for a just settlement of the Middle East crisis or a peaceful solution of the conflict in Cyprus. Attempts to use tension as a pretext for increasing foreign military presence and intervention counteract those principles and United Nations efforts to teach settlements. Elimination of the crisis in South Africa could be promoted by the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and by resolute and concerted international action. The racist regime of South Africa persists in its efforts to prevent the black majority from exercising its fundamental human rights by the adoption of internal repressive measures and by resort to force  and it attempts to stabilize its position in the region by economic blackmail and by military action against the front-line States. We support resolute international action to prevent the Republic of South Africa from evading in every way the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and from continuing its illegal occupation of Namibia  as well as from launching repeated armed attacks from that Territory against Angola.We consider it an urgent task to strengthen security in Asia and the Pacific and to establish constructive co-operation between the countries of the region. It is gratifying to note the increased activity and growing role of small and medium-sized countries in Asia  as well. We support  any efforts by the countries of the region aimed at creating peace and security on the Asian continent. In this spirit  we welcome the policy of national reconciliation of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and support the endeavours of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful and democratic unification of Korea. In our opinion  the policy of national reconciliation proclaimed by the Afghan Government and the mediation activities of the Secretary-General's Personal Representative have increased the chances of eliminating the crisis situation around Afghanistan.The events in the Central American and Caribbean regions continue to give us cause for concern. My Government favours a just  negotiated settlement of the Central American crisis on the basis of full respect for the sovereignty of the countries concerned and for the legitimate interests and national dignity of the peoples of the region. It lends support to the joint efforts of the Contadora Group as well as to all initiatives of the countries of the region aimed at finding a genuine solution.At the current session of the General Assembly  our delegation will devote great attention to the condition of the world economy and to the problems of international economic relations. The openness of the Hungarian economy and the intensity of our external economic relations compel us to follow with close attention any shifts in the external environment of our economy.I must point out that imbalances in the world economy have continued to grow  notable strains have emerged in the international financial and monetary systems and the indebtedness of numerous countries has reached critical levels. The cost of the arms race diverts enormous resources from the productive sphere. The erosion of the international trading system has continued. The growth of protectionist tendencies  discriminatory measures impeding the expansion of international economic relations and restrictions based on non-economic considerations  whose effects are felt especially in trade in modern technologies  are a source of concern.Solutions to the problems of the world economy demand a new type of global approach  particularly from Governments that have a decisive influence on the conditions for economic co-operation. In our view  some progress in developing such an approach has recently been made. Let me refer in this respect only to the round of talks started by the contracting parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the ministerial conference in Punta del Este  Uruguay ι and to the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held last summer.I think that this new world economic outlook  which is more responsive to realities and to world-wide interdependence  is also reflected in the very important document  entitled Our Common Future  of the International Commission for Environment and Development chaired by Prime Minister Brundtland of Norway. My Government agrees with the statements and conclusions of that document.Efforts to create international economic security/ also supported by Hungary  are directed towards ensuring that the principles of partnership relations based on mutual respect for one another's interests  stability  reliability  predictability and fulfilment in good faith of contractual obligations are observed in international economic relations. Implementation of these basic principles can promote mutually advantageous solutions to the present-day problems of the world economy  as well as its balanced growth. World economic problems cannot be solved except with the active co-operation of all participants in international economic relations.Promotion of respect for human rights and their universal implementation - and  to that end  promotion of co-operation among States - is one of the fundamental objectives of the world Organization. Present-day events bear out the recognition expressed in the letter and spirit of the Charter that there is a close relationship between respect for human tights and the maintenance of international peace and security. The United Nations elaboration  through strenuous efforts  of an internationally recognized system of principles and norms relating to human rights is among the Organization's achievements deserving of our recognition.We consider it a central task of the United Nations to take effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights  which also pose a threat to peace and security. Disregard for the right of peoples to self-determination  the humiliating policies and practices of racial hatred  racism and mass discrimination against nationalities and in any other form demand of our Organization  and of each of its Member States  the adoption of a resolute stand  as well as action. A no less important task for the United Nations is the promotion of respect for individual and collective human rights and their effective exercise.We are convinced that the postulate to respect and implement human rights is a major and indispensable achievement of our civilization - a common value of mankind to whose creation we have all contributed. It is necessary to seek points of common interest as well as ways and means of co-operation in order to enrich it.Countries and peoples have followed different historical paths and have started from different foundations in moving closer to the shared values and ideals evolved within the framework of the United Nations system. Such differences are a natural phenomenon - just as the diversity of cultures is - and awareness of this fact may contribute to strengthening confidence in the human tights and humanitarian fields as well.The need for universal implementation of human rights implies exercise of the rights of peoples and individuals  just as it implies recognition and protection of rights for different segments and groups in society  including nationalities. Constructive co-operation in matters affecting the situation of national minorities has an important role to play in inter-State relations and in the development of good-neighbourly relations  and may even influence the political atmosphere of entire regions  in Hungary  the equal participation of nationalities in the political  economic and cultural life of society is an important component of national unity. Recognition of the individual and collective rights of nationalities  including the right to education in their mother tongue  and the creation of institutional and democratic frameworks for their existence  serve to help them preserve  develop and strengthen their identities.The favourable tendencies recently observed in international relations have allowed multilateral forums - including  first of all  the United Nations - to resume an active and effective role in the development of international co-operation. To enable the world Organization to live up to that role  it is indispensable to enhance its effectiveness and streamline its activity. At the same time  this requires that every Member State contribute constructively as much as it can to overcome the difficulties in the operation of the United Nations. We are now at a propitious moment for the world Organization and for the entire community of nations. The States Members of the United Nations must seize the opportunity to steer the course of the world irreversibly towards disarmament and international co-operation. I hope that the work of the present session of the United Nations General Assembly will also help to ensure that more and more States become aware of this opportunity and take an active part in joint efforts to ensure the accomplishment of this mission."
"65",3149,"IDN",42,1987,"﻿Allow me first  on behalf of the Indonesian delegation  to extend our sincere congratulations to Mr. Peter Florin on his election as President at the forty-second session of the General Assembly. His elevation to that high office is a tribute to his personal qualities and record of great distinction in the service of his Government and of the international community. I am fully confident that under his stewardship we shall achieve substantive progress in our work.To his distinguished predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  I wish to convey our deep gratitude for  and appreciation of  the exemplary manner in which he presided over our deliberations during the last session.The past year has been marked by several significant developments affecting the course of international relations. During the forty-first session the Assembly took a momentous decision to strengthen and revitalize the functioning of the United Nations. Its implications went beyond the confines of Improving the Organization's administrative efficiency and financial viability and provided a critical boost to its capacity to face the multiple challenges confronting the international community. It has resulted in renewed confidence and recognition of the irreplaceable role and value of the United Nations as the unique multilateral framework for dealing with the global problems of our time. The ability of the United Nations to rally the community of nations in common purpose to seek solutions to a diversity of critical issues has been manifest at various forums during the past year.Last June some 140 nations gathered in Vienna for the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. The Declaration and Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline adopted at that Conference were clear manifestations of the ability of nations to forgo rhetoric and polemics in favour of jointly facing a common threat - not only a threat to the moral and social foundations of all societies  but indeed a potent threat to the youth who represent the future of all countries. Meeting against the sombre background of a global economy in the throes of persistent crisis  the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  convened in Geneva this summer  was able to overcome the paralysing differences and scepticism that had plagued previous sessions and achieved by consensus the Final Act of the Conference. In addressing squarely the key issues in the fields of trade  money  finance and development  the agreements reached may well presage a resurgence of momentum in the North-South dialogue and signal a reversal of the current malaise in international co-operation for development·The recently concluded Conference on Disarmament and Development was yet another landmark in the process of jointly addressing two of the most urgent challenges facing the world today. For the first time at the intergovernmental level the close and multidimensional link between disarmament and development was explicitly acknowledged and the Final Document of the Conference committed participating Governments to making this relationship an effective and productive one.We believe that  above all  the results of these conferences have contributed to arresting the erosion of multilateralism and to strengthening the commitment of Governments to the larger common interests and priority concerns of the international community.While these are all encouraging developments  they cannot and should not divert our collective view from the dismal realities and dangerous anomalies that still condition the present international situation. Today more than ever before  we have become aware of the dangers posed by an unrestrained arms race in the nuclear era  which  apart from its potent threat of mutual destruction  is now also acknowledged to be a serious impediment to the pursuit of optimal development· The world economy remains mired in prolonged crisis  international economic relations are in acute imbalance  and economic development is bogged down in sharply reduced growth or stagnation. At the same time  the persistence of tensions and conflicts in many regions continue to take a heavy toll in both human and material resources of nations. The struggle for self-determination and true independence  justice and racial equality  economic progress and social emancipation must still contend with outmoded structures and new forms of neo-colonialist domination  pressures  interference and intervention.If we are to move progressively towards a more viable world order of common security and common prosperity  there can be no alternative to fostering the renewed recognition of the value and indispensability of multilateral co-operation.This is particularly relevant in the fields of disarmament and international security. I have earlier referred to the recently concluded Conference on Disarmament and Development. Indonesia welcomes the results that were achieved through the consensus of all participating States. Although it obviously fell short of our expectations  the Final Document of the Conference in our view provides us with a sufficiently broad framework for our future action and continuing efforts in these two interrelated fields upon which the building of a more peaceful  secure and prosperous world is so vitally dependent. In focusing global attention on the negative and far-reaching implications of current military expenditures  especially by the major Power blocs  for the world economy and the present international system and by highlighting the pervasive non-military threats to security  the Conference succeeded in establishing a compelling economic case against the arms race. It also underlined the imperative need to redirect resources released through disarmament to the improvement of the socio-economic conditions of the developing countries  especially. It is to be regretted that the Conference could not yet agree to provide for an international financial mechanism to facilitate such a reallocation of resources· None the less  Indonesia expects that on the basis of the Action Programme that was adopted  this and other follow-up actions will be pursued in the context of an enhanced  interrelated perspective within the United Nations and its appropriate organs and agencies.We are also greatly encouraged by the progress that is being made in the disarmament negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. We welcome their agreement in principle to conclude a treaty eliminating all intermediate- and shorter-range nuclear missiles - a treaty which  however limited in scope  would for the first time involve the actual dismantling of specific categories of nuclear weapons. Such an accord may  it is to be hoped  lead to further agreements on the larger issues of strategic and space armaments.More importantly  it is to be hoped that this initial but significant achievement may bring about a new atmosphere and give a fresh impetus to the multilateral disarmament negotiations now in progress in Geneva. Bilateral agreements between the super-Powers only  while providing the  necessary catalyst towards general disarmament  do not meet the goal of eliminating all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction under effective international control. Although primary responsibility indeed rests with those who possess a monopoly of destructive power  all States have a vital stake in disarmament and therefore have the right and the duty to contribute to this process. If concrete progress is to be made in genuine arms limitation and disarmament  then multilateral negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations should be the rule rather than the exception. Accordingly  the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva should be allowed to perform its rightful function as the single multilateral negotiating forum in the field of disarmament. In this context  we should like in particular to see the Conference on Disarmament complete as soon as possible the negotiations on a chemical-weapons convention and continue to deal with such questions as a comprehensive test ban and the prevention of an arms race in outer space on a high-priority basis.Our collective efforts to strengthen international co-operation and to meet the challenges of the future can hardly succeed while unresolved conflicts continue to rage in many regions of the world. It is of the utmost importance to bring to an early end the strife and turmoil which have their source in the continued violation of the fundamental rights of nations and peoples as envisaged in the Charter. This is painfully self-evident in the region of southern Africa  where institutionalised racism and the remaining vestiges of colonialism continue to affront our shared sense of justice and morality.Despite world-wide censure and condemnation  the racist Pretoria regime has intensified its campaign of brute terror against the oppressed majority and persists in its illegal occupation of Namibia. Its lawless and predatory nature is further reflected in its incessant acts of aggression  political destabilization and economic strangulation against its neighbours  particularly the front-line States  thus posing a constant threat to regional and international peace and security.Apartheid is at the root of the deepening crisis in southern Africa and must be eradicated in its totality. It is high time for those who pay lip service to the dismantling of that inhuman system but who continue to lend credence and support to Pretoria to cease such duplicitous behaviour and join the international community in working towards the objective of a free  non-racial and democratic society in South Africa. Likewise  the liberation of Namibia is a sine qua non for the re-establishment of peace and stability region-wide. It is utterly unacceptable that after almost 10 years since the adoption of the United Nations plan for Namibia's independence South Africa continues to cling to irrelevant pretexts such as the presence of Cuban troops in Angola to block its implementation. Indonesia has long been convinced that Pretoria will not voluntarily co-operate in the realization of the genuine independence of Namibia and that the only alternative is to compel it to comply with United Nations decisions.The Security Council can no longer justify any further procrastination in imposing comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa· For if there is one Government against which Articles 39 and 40 of the United Nations Charter should appropriately be applied it is surely the renegade regime in Pretoria.Time and again the search for a just and durable peace in the Middle East has been thwarted by Israel's brazen acts of expansionist aggression against its neighbours  its reign of terror and repression in the occupied Arab territories and its illegal policies and practices directed towards the goal of ultimate annexation of Arab lands and the permanent denial of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and independent statehood. Let there be no illusions among us that it is precisely in pursuance of those sinister designs that Israel is bent upon sabotaging any prospect of the convening of the international conference on peace in the Middle East  There is also no doubt that Israel's intransigence could hardly be sustained without the virtual carte blanche extended to it by its powerful friends and supporters.	.My Government remains convinced that it is only through the proposed international peace conference that a viable negotiating framework can be established within which all the dimensions of the Arab-Israeli conflict and its core aspect of Palestinian self-determination can be comprehensively addressed. It would also provide an acceptable forum where all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation organization (PLO)  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  could participate on an equal footing.Given the ever present danger of escalating violence and widening conflict  there should be no further delay in preparing for the conference. We fully concur with the Secretary-General that questions of procedure should not present insurmountable obstacles and that our priority concern should continue to be directed towards what the conference would achieve in terms of the objective of just and lasting peace in accordance with the aspirations of the peoples of the region.Recent initiatives undertaken by the Security Council offer renewed hope of a mutually acceptable negotiated settlement of the agonizing conflict between Iran and Iraq  which has lasted far too long and has inflicted such grievous loss of human life and material destruction on both sides. The protracted hostilities now threaten to expand into wider conflagration  including the deepening involvement of extra-regional Powers  which we cannot but view with serious concern. It is Indonesia's fervent hope that the Secretary-General's current efforts  mandated by Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  will succeed in bringing an end to war and paving the way towards a comprehensive  just and honourable peace.In the sub region of South-East Asia the unresolved conflict situation in Kampuchea still constitutes the one major obstacle blocking the path towards stable peace  regional harmony and common prosperity. Despite continuing hopes for some movement in the direction of a just and comprehensive settlement through dialogue and negotiation  the profound and legitimate aspirations of the Kampuchean people to an end to foreign intervention and the presence of foreign forces on its soil  and to self-determination and national reconciliation still remain unfulfilled. My Government is acutely aware of the complications and dangers of the prolonged impasse in resolving this tragic conflict  which cannot but be contrary to the interests of all the parties concerned. Thus  in July of this year Indonesia  as interlocutor for the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  arrived at an understanding with Viet Nam on the holding of an informal meeting  without pre-conditions and with no political labels  of all political factions of the Kampuchean people  on an equal footing  in which at a later stage Viet Nam and other countries concerned would be invited to participate.We sincerely believe that this two-stage informal get-together would be a useful device in breaking the deadlock and preparing for actual negotiations towards a settlement of the Kampuchean problem in all its complex ramifications. We regret to note that this understanding has subsequently evoked differing interpretations among some of the parties directly concerned. Nevertheless  Indonesia  together with the other states members of ASEAN  stands ready to engage Viet Nam in the continued search for a political solution that would lead to the restoration of a genuinely independent  neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea  while at the same time assuring the legitimate interest of all countries in the region in living in peace with one another free from extra-regional pressures and interference.On the situation in Afghanistan  we have taken note with keen interest of the progress made and the obstacles that remain in the efforts aimed at finding a viable settlement. A negotiated solution based on the withdrawal of foreign forces and the restoration of the independence  sovereignty and non-aligned status of Afghanistan would not only bring peace and national reconciliation to the valiant Afghan people but also contribute to greater harmony and stability in the relationships among the States in the region and beyond. Recent events in New Caledonia have shown that a process of decolonisation which ignores or suppresses the innate rights of the indigenous people cannot yield a just or durable outcome. The holding of a referendum under such conditions serves only to exacerbate the divisions and strife in the Territory. Self-determination and the peaceful transition to an independent New Caledonia can come about only if it is fully in accordance with the fundamental rights and interests of the indigenous Kanak people  while at the same time guaranteeing the rights and interests of all inhabitants of the Territory's multi-ethnic and multiracial society.With so many persistent conflicts defying peaceful resolution  it is with particular satisfaction that Indonesia welcomes the conclusion of the agreement between the Central American States to establish a stable and lasting peace in accordance with the principles of sovereignty  common security  non-interference  self-determination  democracy and development. The accord represents a clear reaffirmation that dialogue and negotiations among the regional States themselves institute the most effective means of resolving regional problems. It is now more essential than ever for all the parties involved  including countries external to the sub region  to sustain the momentum of the peace process and make possible the emergence of a regional order truly responsive to the basic Interests and aspirations of the peoples of Central America.In the economic sphere  the international agenda this year has been dominated by the convening of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). That Conference assumed crucial importance because it was expected not only to address the key issues central to the health of the world economy but also to revive the stalemated dialogue between the developed North and the developing South and reactivate multilateral co-operation for development. The Conference was held against the dismal backdrop of a world economy caught in serious imbalances and dislocations. As summarized in UNCTAD  We agreed assessment of global economic trends  compared with the preceding two decades the' world economy in the 1980s has been characterized by a slowdown in growth of demand and output despite generally lower rates of inflation. Many developing countries are experiencing serious difficulties in adapting to structural changes under the impact of such acute reversals as mounting external debt burdens  high real interest rates  increased protectionism and commodity prices depressed to their lowest levels in 50 years. In short  the present decade is witnessing a generally insecure economic environment in which millions of people still lack the basic conditions for a decent life. It is a matter of considerable satisfaction to Indonesia that after long and often strenuous debate UNCTAD VII could in the end unanimously agree on a set of policy measures covering the four key interrelated areas of resources for development  commodities  international trade and the problems of the least developed countries. Obviously  these policy measures still fall far short of the expectations of the Group of 77 as expressed in the Havana Declaration. Indeed  some of these prescribed policies amount to a simple reiteration of earlier unimplemented policy measures and are thus wholly inadequate to meet the aggravated situation of today. Nevertheless  judged against the background of the persistent crisis enveloping much of the developing world and the stalemate in the North-South dialogue  the consensus achieved represents a step in the right direction.One development which was the highlight of the Conference  and which is of particular interest to my delegation  was the decision by the USSR to sign the Common Fund Agreement  thus opening up the very real likelihood of an early entry into force of the agreement· We trust that the follow-up action for the speedy operation of the Fund will also be promptly undertaken. But the major overall conclusion that can be drawn is that UNCTAD has emerged stronger from the process  thereby rebuffing the efforts by some to marginalize its role.While quite understandably preoccupied with the more immediate threats to our development efforts  we should not lose sight of the longer-term challenges confronting us. The multiple crises which are currently besetting the world can no longer be viewed or addressed in their sectoral compartmentalization. As the Secretary-General aptly points out in his report on the work of the Organization  the symbiosis of development  environment and population is beginning to be better appreciated. In facing this challenge we welcome the timely decision of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to submit to this session of the General Assembly two major reports of great relevance  namely the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond  and the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development  entitled ""Our Common Future·. It is indeed crucial for us to ensure accelerated growth and development in order to meet our present needs without compromising the well-being of our future generations. This is essentially what we understand to be the meaning of sustainable development. We agree with the World Commission that poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems; and that it would be futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective covering the underlying world poverty and international inequality. It is also undeniable that sustainable development would be further enhanced by an international atmosphere of peace  security and co-operation free from the presence and the threat of war  especially nuclear war  and the waste of intellectual and natural resources on armaments.Turning to the world social situation  we must remain vigilant so as to ensure that the substantial progress already achieved in various fields will not fall victim to the adverse trends in the global economy.In Indonesia and the other countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)   the implementation of programmes such as that of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on the strategy of child survival and development  which is supported at the highest levels of Government  has led to Immeasurable improvements in the quality of life of our peoples. Central to this success Is the importance of widespread popular participation and guidance  as recently manifested by the adoption of an agenda for action by parliamentarians from the ASEAN region in support of this strategy. If such direction can be sustained our goal of health for all by the year 2000 can Indeed become a reality. In Indonesia  social development programmes continue to enjoy the strong personal support of President Suharto and have resulted in dramatic advances  particularly in such areas as the immunization of children. Despite the severe constraints of economic adjustment  social development has also been greatly accelerated both by the institution of integrated health and social services and by the increased attention being focused on Improving the status of women.I have already alluded to the results of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. The progress achieved in that forum should now be sustained with decisive action at the national  regional and International level. Of critical importance In this regard Is the speedy finalization of the new draft convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  as a necessary complement to existing International instruments.Indonesia is also encouraged by the progress that has been achieved in the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. The registration of India as the first pioneer Investor is a significant augury for the implementation of the provisions of the Convention as regards the sea-bed regime and resolution II of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Indonesia urges all States which have not done so to ratify the Convention to ensure its early entry into force.It is quite apparent that the economic and social issues of our time have become increasingly multidimensional in character and closely Interrelated. We therefore concur with the Secretary-General's observation in his annual report that ""in dealing with this web of global problems  the United Nations system will need to be more fully integrated  and better able to follow priorities established for the system as a whole"". (A/42/1  p. 14). In this connection  my delegation has noted with interest his proposal to strengthen the role of the Economic and Social Council in order to make it more consonant with the original intent of the Charter. We are confident that in conducting the in-depth study of the United Nations intergovernmental structure in the economic and social fields the Council's Special Commission will give this proposal the serious consideration that it deserves.At the same time it should always be borne in mind that all efforts to strengthen the role  improve the functioning and Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations and its organs will remain marginal unless they are matched by the consistent support  including financial support  of all Member States. Therefore  in order to reach an effective solution to the current crisis confronting the Organization it is necessary to re-emphasize at this time the imperative need for all Member States to fulfil their financial obligations under the Charter.In a world of increasing interdependence of nations and interrelationship of issues  international co-operation is no longer an option  it is a necessity. Equally  recognition of the fundamental rights and interests of all nations and peoples  apart from being a moral imperative  is an essential prerequisite for lasting peace. The eradication of the poverty and deprivation which afflict vast areas of the world can no longer be regarded as a long-term goal; it is of urgent relevance to national and international security. If the pursuit of these objectives is to achieve tangible results it is to the revitalization of the multilateral institutions that we must turn. While our Organization is obviously not without deficiencies  our hopes for a new world order must lie not in the rejection but in the rejuvenation of the United Nations. Utilizing the system effectively is as important as changing it. Together we should exert continuous efforts to strengthen the United Nations as the principal collective Instrument through which Members can resolve the fundamental global issues confronting humanity."
"66",3196,"IND",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session attests to your personal eminence and distinction and our confidence in the guidance and leadership you will provide to our deliberations. We are particularly happy since you come from a country with which India has warm and fraternal relations. We congratulate you on your election and look forward to working together with you.Allow me also to pay a tribute to our esteemed friend and neighbour from Bangladesh  Foreign Minister Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  for the effective manner in which he conducted the proceedings of our last session.We greet also our distinguished Secretary-General  and wish him well in the discharge of his many exacting responsibilities.The year 1987 has special significance for us in India. Four decades ago our people won freedom from colonial bondage through a unique non-violent struggle. Independent India took its rightful place in the comity of nations. We have sought to strengthen the foundations of new India by keeping what is best from our own tradition and by assimilating what is admirable from other civilizations. The fundamental concepts of tolerance  non-violence and equality have conditioned our Weltanschauung. Tolerance and non-violence are embedded in our policy of peaceful coexistence and the principles of Panchshila. Equality lies at the root of our belief in democracy and in the sovereign equality of all nations  a principle that is embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.Even before our independence  the people of India reposed great faith in this Organization. We were present at its creation. The founder of modern India  our first Prime Minister  Jawaharlal Nehru  proclaimed that India's attitude towards the United Nations was one of wholehearted co-operation  and of unreserved adherence  both in letter and spirit  to its Charter  It was in this spirit that he promised that India would; ""participate fully in its varied activities and endeavour to assume that role in its Councils to which her geographical position  population and contribution towards peaceful progress entitled her.""In our own way  we have endeavoured to fulfil this promise. Though the Organization has had many ups and downs in its short but chequered history  our commitment to it has never wavered. We ate happy that it has been resilient enough to withstand the attempts to retreat from multilateralism and the financial and budgetary pressures brought to bear upon the Organization.My delegation welcomes the significant understanding between the United States and the USSR to eliminate in termediate-1ange nuclear forces. Even though these forces constitute only a very small fraction of the world's nuclear arsenals  we see the significance of the understanding in the prospects it has opened up for more wide-ranging agreements  which could eventually lead to meaningful nuclear disarmament.This understanding vividly demonstrates that  given political will  disarmament measures can become a reality. It is imperative that this momentum towards peace and disarmament be sustained. While the primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament rests with the United States and the Soviet Union  a decision by other nuclear-weapon Powers to eliminate nuclear weapons would be an important contribution to the promotion of peace.Not long ago  on 22 May 1987  Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi joined with leaders of Argentina  Greece  Mexico  Sweden and Tanzania in emphasizing that: ""For too long  fear and mistrust have prevented progress in disarmament. Arms and fears feed on each other. Now is the time to break this vicious circle and lay the foundation for a more secure world"". (A/42/319  Annex). It may perhaps be premature to believe that the ""vicious circle"" is broken·  but it has perhaps been dented and we hope that the momentum will not be lost.A historic event in this continuing struggle to save humanity from a nuclear holocaust was the signing of the Delhi Declaration on principles for a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world  in New Delhi last November. Its importance lies in the fact that a major nuclear-weapon Power  the USSR  joined with a major non-aligned country  India  to announce 10 principles that could pave the way to a nuclear-weapon-free civilization. We are happy that a beginning has been made by the super-Powers towards translating at least some of the principles of the Delhi Declaration into concrete action.The international arms race and its deleterious effect on the world economy was the focus of a conference earlier this month. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development threw into stark relief the deplorable dilemma of massive global expenditure on arms  on the one hand  and the non-availability of resources for meeting the basic needs of a large portion of the world's population  on the other. An overwhelming majority of nations took part in it. I had the privilege of presiding over that Conference  which reaffirmed  at the political level for the first time  the relationship between disarmament and development. It is important that follow-up steps be taken quickly so that the conclusions of that Conference may be translated into action. May we now hope that those who stayed away from those discussions will participate in this effort. I now turn my attention to southern Africa  where the struggle for freedom and equality continues to this day. The racist regime in Pretoria violates every norm of civilized conduct. Its policy of apartheid is an affront to the conscience of mankind. The Pretoria regime remains in illegal occupation of Namibia and continues to carry out acts of aggression against the front-line States. It is thus the root cause of tension  instability and conflict in the region  endangering international peace and security. It has rejected every initiative for a peaceful resolution of the problems of the region. In the face of the intransigence of the racist regime  the only peaceful course before the international community is to impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa·  the alternative is violent upheaval. We reiterate our full support for the freedom struggle of the people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization. The only basis for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian question lies in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  without bringing in any linkages.The non-aligned countries  at their summit meeting in Harare last year  decided to set up the Africa Fund  with the object of assisting the front-line States and national liberation movements in southern Africa against the depredations of the racist regime. India is privileged to have been chosen to chair the fund  which has become operational with wide support from the international community. Those of us who believe in the moral need to work for the peaceful resolution of the problems of southern Africa have a duty to support and contribute to the fund.On 29 July President Jayawardene of Sri Lanka and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi signed a historic agreement which has brought peace and tranquillity to Sri Lanka after four years. We had throughout stressed the importance and the necessity of a political settlement to the ethnic conflict that had plagued Sri Lanka since 1983. I should like to pay tribute to the President of Sri Lanka for signing this agreement  which is a manifestation of the fact that non-aligned countries can resolve their problems without outside interference. Bearing in mind the recent history of the conflict  there are inevitably minor hitches and problems  but they are not insurmountable. Given the existing understanding and goodwill between the two countries they will be resolved sooner rather than later.The situation in West Asia is gravely worrying. The core problem is the question of Palestine. The people of Palestine are still denied their inalienable human rights  including the right to establish an independent state in their homeland. We support the struggle of the Palestinian people  led by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). We urge that an international peace conference on the Middle East be convened at an early date  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the PLO.The continuing hostilities between Iran and Iraq concern us greatly. We have close historical ties with both countries. Our heartfelt desire is to see those two nations live in peace. The conflict between two important members of the Non-Aligned Movement  taking place as it does in a region which is in our immediate neighbourhood  has consistently engaged our attention. The United Nations has been deeply involved in seeking ways and means to end the war. The Security Council adopted unanimously resolution 598 (1987) and the Secretary-General has been engaged in important consultations relating to its implementation. We commend and support these continuing efforts in the hope that they will bring about a	'negotiated  mutually acceptable settlement of this tragic conflict.India supports the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to secure an early and peaceful solution to the situation in Afghanistan. The military presence of great Powers in the Indian Ocean is ominous. Such presence has unfortunately intensified in recent months. The heightened military  presence of outside Powers is in conflict with the 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. It demonstrates vividly that the main objective behind the 1971 Declaration is as valid today as it was when the Declaration was made.   What is more  it shows the futility of efforts to dilute the thrust of the primacy in the objective of the Declaration  which is to tackle the external threat in the Indian Ocean. In that context we believe that for the proposed international conference on the Indian Ocean to achieve meaningful results it will be necessary to ensure that all big Powers having a military presence in the Indian Ocean participate.I come new to another neighbouring region of ours with which we have very close historical and cultural links. As we have always advocated in conflict situations  the south-east Asian question can be resolved only through political dialogue. The legitimate interests and concerns of the countries in the region must be taken into account. We are encouraged by the fact that all countries in the region want a peaceful solution and are engaged in finding a formula for a regional dialogue. We have seen possibilities of common areas of understanding emerge following the recent meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Viet Nam I have myself recently visited all the countries belonging to the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Indo-China States. We believe that such contacts must be strengthened and more widely established among the countries of the region.The Korean peninsula continues to remain divided. We support the desire of its people for peaceful reunification. There have been encouraging developments in Central America. Following the invaluable work of the Contadora and Support Groups the Central American States have taken a regional initiative of great importance. We warmly welcome the Guatemala accord and the subsequent follow-up action. We trust that all parties  both within and outside the region  will co-operate fully to ensure the success of this regional initiative  which offers the prospect of peace  progress and stability in Central America.We reaffirm once again our solidarity with the people of Cyprus  whose country remains divided with part of it under foreign occupation. We reaffirm our support for the unity  territorial integrity  sovereignty  independence and non-alignment of Cyprus  a country with which we have traditionally had close and friendly relations. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about a satisfactory resolution of this issue.The events in Fiji have been deeply distressing. It is particularly tragic that at a time when the political parties representing the people of Fiji had come to an agreement which could have taken the country on the path of national reconciliation the armed forces have dealt a severe blow to that process  by seizing power for a second time. Attempts to deprive citizens of the country of their legitimate rights merely on the basis of their racial origin are against all tenets of democracy and human rights and are contrary to the United Nations Charter. What is happening in Fiji has distinct and unacceptable racial overtones. This development is reprehensible. We believe that the path to peace and prosperity in Fiji lies in the restoration of democracy and the rule of law.This year India achieved the unique distinction of becoming the first registered pioneer investor under the United Nations regime of the oceans with the allotment of a deep sea-bed mine site in the Central Indian Ocean. An equivalent mine site has been reserved for international exploration and exploitation. We believe that this historic event has set in motion the international regime of deep sea-bed mining and has strengthened the rule of international law. I now turn to the world economy  which continues to be in a state of deep disarray. The rates of growth of even developed countries are historically very low. All future projections indicate even lower rates of growth for those countries. The per capita incomes of many developing countries have dropped to levels lower than they were a decade ago. Commodity prices in real terms have collapsed to their lowest levels in 50 years. Despite the launching of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations  the proliferation of protectionist measures continues unabated. Interest rates continue to be high in real terms. International liquidity has suffered a sharp contraction in relation both to the volume of trade and to the needs of developing countries. The pattern of trade balance is extremely skewed  with unsustainable surpluses in some countries and deficits in others  and exchange rates continue to show wide fluctuations. It is now widely recognized that the world economy faces a structural crisis which cannot be overcome within the framework of the system instituted after the Second World War. There is therefore an urgent need for evolving co-operative strategies informed by the explicit recognition of increasing global interdependence. We require concerted and comprehensive policy measures in the interrelated areas of money  finance  debt  trade  resource flows and development. The current crisis of the world economic system can be overcome only if we work towards a new international economic order.In the area of international trade  the highest priority must be given to the preservation and strengthening of an open multilateral trading system  and particularly to translating into practice the oft-repeated commitments on standstill and rollback. It is important to ensure that the Uruguay round of negotiations leads to the emergence of a truly international trade regime conducive to growth and development  with a clear recognition of the needs of developing countries. Multilaterlism and non-discrimination must form the basis for the sustained expansion of trade.In the area of commodities  we reaffirmed at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) the continued validity of the integrated Programme for Commodities. We trust that with the new ratifications the Common Fund will become operational before the end of 19B7. We also hope that the new round of consultations on commodities not covered by existing agreements and arrangements will be initiated soon.The flows of financial resources from developed to developing countries should be increased substantially and the resources of international financial institutions should be augmented so as to enable them to play a leading role in development finance. We are disappointed that the eighth replenishment of the International Development Association is no larger in real terms than the sixth replenishment. We are however encouraged by the recent move towards reaching agreement on a general capital increase of the World Bank.The external debt crisis is one of the most serious problems afflicting the developing countries today. The solution to the debt crisis has to be equitable  flexible and development-oriented  based on the concept of shared responsibility and political dialogue. For the success of such a strategy  the promotion of parallel objectives - such as increased access to markets for exports of developing countries  lower interest rates  strengthened and stabilized commodity prices  more stable exchange rates and more vigorous growth-oriented macro-economic policies in major developed countries - is indispensable.In the light of the generally dismal state of the international economic dialogue  the recent seventh session of UNCTAD must be viewed as a modest success. In at least some areas progress was achieved. Viewed against the background in which the Conference was held  its major significance lies in the reaffirmation of the validity and mandate of UNCTAD.The report of the World Commission on Environment and Development is a major contribution to the subject. We are glad to note that the Chairman of the Commission  Prime Minister Brundtland  in her address to UNCTAD VII  sought to allay apprehensions that environmental concerns could be used for imposing additional conditionality in the lending policies of international financial institutions. The Brundtland report clearly demonstrates the importance and urgency of tackling environmental issues on a global level. If we seriously want to attach high priority to this objective  the international community must find additional resources for sound environmental measures. Any diversion of existing resources from growth-focused to environment-focused disbursement will be counter-productive. Poverty pollutes. Any slowing down of development can only aggravate environmental problems in developing countries.We meet here each year in the month of September to deliberate on what ails mankind. Does looking back on the past nine months fill us with hope or despair? This is a time for stocktaking  self-criticism and introspection. The international horizon presents a dark and sinister picture. Here and there an all too brief break in the clouds is visible; otherwise we seem to be looking at clouds that have no silver lining.Some weeks ago the world population exceeded the 5 billion mark - a sobering event. The drain on sources of energy is unabated. The affluent are burning their candles at both ends and in the middle too  while the less fortunate are deprived of the basic necessities of life. The daily onslaught on the environment continues. The economic scene is not cheering. Terrorists and fanatics disturb the peace and repose of nations.The United Nations does not offer salvation  but it has paved  it can pave  the way  create the atmosphere  provide the venue and propose the agenda for peace. As somebody has said  while it cannot  perhaps  negotiate for the world  the United Nations can help the world to negotiate."
"67",3242,"IRL",42,1987,"﻿I should like to express my congratulations to Mr. Peter Florin on his election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I am sure that our work will benefit greatly from his Presidency  I should like also to avail myself of this opportunity to thank his predecessor for his able leadership of the forty-first session-This forty-second session of the General Assembly convenes at a very important juncture in world affairs. For the first time for many years there is the prospect of significant arms control· Agreement between the two super-Powers is now under way. The agreement in principle that was announced last week is very welcome as an important first contribution to what we hope will be a continuing disarmament process. We were reminded very recently at the Conference held here on disarmament and development of the extent to which the existence of excessive armaments across the whole spectrum is a burden on the international community as a whole. It is a burden which must be reduced. We are encouraged by the readiness of the super-powers to begin the process of disarmament  which we believe will serve as a step towards a more general easing of international tensions.We cannot  however  lose sight of the many elements of instability which continue to mar the international scene. The agenda for this session is composed of as long a list of conflicts unresolved and disputes unsettled as any of its predecessors. In addition to regional conflicts we are faced with a lack of respect for human rights; the emergence  or in some cases re-emergence  of famine conditions and ever increasing expenditure on armaments Including in particular expenditure by those nations which can least afford it· These remain the sad realities for far too many of the world's inhabitants.How well equipped is this Organization to tackle this particular agenda? We are all aware of the criticisms which are made of the United Nations and its affiliated bodies. It is said that the United Nations is selective in the topics with which it chooses to deal  that it is partial in its criticisms and that it has been wasteful of its resources. Of course it is an imperfect institution operating in a very imperfect world. Friends of the United Nations  among which my Government would wish to be regarded  must admit that there has been and remains an element of truth in those claims. We are just as conscious of the flaws in this Organization as any  but we are dedicated to remedying those flaws.At the same time it is also essential to emphasize the genuine achievements of the Organization. How can one ignore the contribution of the United Nations to the process of decolonisation; its part in the protection and promotion of human rights throughout the world; its work and that of the specialized agencies within its framework for development and for the eradication of disease and hunger; its efforts to promote the goal of disarmament  including in particular the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty; and the part which its peace-making and peace-keeping machinery has played in resolving or sometimes defusing conflicts which could have escalated much further?The value of the mechanisms offered by the United Nations to Member States as an alternative to the threat or use of force should not be underestimated. In this regard the major Powers  which have been given very special rights under the Charter  have a particular responsibility. If they take the lead in co-operating to make the United Nations systems work more effectively and live up to the hopes of its founders they can be confident that they will have the support of the great majority of the Members of the Organization.There are grounds  especially in recent times  for cautious optimism. In particular  developments in the past few weeks encourage my delegation to the view that the United Nations will continue to occupy the central place in the conduct of world affairs assigned to it by its Charter. First  I would refer to the Security Council. The recent initiative taken by the Council  with the support of all its members  in the long-running conflict between Iran and Iraq has shown a willingness on the part of the members of that body to discharge the responsibilities vested in them by the Charter. The unity of purpose manifested on that occasion offers the hope that those provisions of the Charter conceived as central to the functioning of the United Nations as a world Organization can be implemented for the effective maintenance of international peace and security.Secondly  in a somewhat different order of ideas  the adoption by consensus at last year's session of a comprehensive resolution on the reform of administrative and budgetary procedures in the United Nations marked a significant stage in the Organization's development. It is important that the unity and spirit of compromise shown then should not be a transient phenomenon but should influence the ongoing implementation of these measures of reforms. Those measures safeguard the essential functioning of the United Nations as an organization of sovereignty equal States committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter  The role played by the Secretary-General in promoting the updating and streamlining of the Organization has been a key factor in the progress made to date· It is essential that he be given the fullest possible support in managing the financial and human resources of the Organization While a beginning has been made in establishing a basis for sensible budget-making within the United Nations  the financial situation of the Organization remains precarious. All Member States have  in subscribing to the Charter  committed themselves to meet their mandatory financial obligations in full. The payment of such contributions Is therefore a legal requirement  binding on the Member States in the same manner as their other international obligations.My Government attaches a central importance to the peace-keeping activities of the United Nations and is proud that Ireland has been able to contribute to most of the Organization's peace-keeping operations. Responsibility for the establishment of a peace-keeping force rests with the Security Council. It is therefore in the first instance to the members of the Council that troop contributors look for support in the discharge of the tasks which they have been mandated  and have agreed  to undertake. That support is essential if the mandate of an operation is to be implemented in full and if its financing is to be assured. In addition  a peace-keeping force can  of course  succeed in its tasks only if It enjoys the full co-operation of the parties to the conflict.Judged against those criteria  the situation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) gives cause for some disquiet. Over the past 14 months three members of the Irish contingent have lost their lives while on duty in south Lebanon. Other contingents there have also suffered casualties. It is unacceptable that co-operation continues to be withheld from the Force and that the mandate which has been renewed at regular intervals since it was first adopted in 1978 remains inoperable. My  Government continues to call for the complete withdrawal from southern Lebanon of Israeli troops  the dismantling of the so—called security zone and an end to harassment of United Nations peace-keeping troops by irregular forces.The Secretary-General  too  has repeatedly called for the necessary co-operation to be extended to UNIFIL so as to allow it to complete a mission which has been undertaken in the interests of peace and with the backing of the international community. My delegation strongly endorses that call and supports the Secretary-General in that particular matter. The Secretary-General has also pointed to the unsatisfactory financial position of the Force caused by the continued withholding of contributions due in respect of both the present and previous mandate periods. If troop contributors are to continue to undertake these onerous responsibilities  all concerned must decide to act in full conformity with the Security Council's mandate to the Force.Since the founding of this Organization  East-West relations have been a central preoccupation of the international community. The capacity of the Security Council to discharge its primary responsibility for International peace and security is clearly influenced by the state of super-Power relations. This is a reality. Recent indications of positive developments In East'-West relations are therefore of considerable interest to all Members of the United Nations. Ireland welcomes these indications and hopes that a secure foundation for a lasting dialogue will now be laid  in the belief that more secure and stable International relations can result from a process of comprehensive and realistic dialogue between the super-Powers.We attach importance in particular to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process as a significant aspect of East-West relations. This established framework for dealing with security and co-operation between East and West in Europe has brought notable improvements in the conditions of all of the people of Europe  East and West  as well as facilitating relations between the participating States. My Government hopes to see further developments in the process  leading to greater contacts between the peoples of Europe  more sustained co-operation at the level of States  and more effective recognition of human rights  so that the impact of agreements reached can be felt by all Europeans. We hope to see a successful outcome in the course of this year  in the shape of a balanced and substantive final document as a follow-up to the meeting taking place at present in Vienna.Successive sessions of the General Assembly have underlined the need for serious and sustained efforts to check the arms race. I have said already that we welcome the improved prospects of agreement for the first time between the United States and the Soviet Union to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on both sides. The agreement in principle to the global elimination of intermediate-range nuclear weapons is welcome in itself  but also as a step which will  we hope  lead to more general disarmament  and we must regard it as a first step in that direction. We hope  therefore  that it signals the beginning of a process conducive to the easing of international tensions more generally throughout the world. There is  I believe  a universal and deeply felt desire that these negotiations should continue with a view not only to preventing an arms race in space and terminating it on earth but also to bringing about a further reduction of nuclear weapons in all categories.The conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty would be an obvious and practical step in inhibiting the further technical development of these weapons  thus helping to reduce reliance on these particular weapons by the nuclear-weapon States. A ban on testing  accompanied by the reduction in nuclear weapons that now appears imminent  would provide important and timely reassurance on the intentions of the nuclear-weapon States. Ireland is convinced that there are no technical obstacles in the way of such a ban  if the will exists.  The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development has only recently concluded its deliberations in these very halls and we are happy that the participants agreed on a Final Document by consensus. The subjects of disarmament and development are at the very core of the concerns o£ this Organization. Ireland is persuaded that the need of all States for security can be met by progress in both disarmament and development. The international community should be alive to every opportunity to make use of resources freed by disarmament measures  undertaken for whatever reason  for the purposes of development.Despite widespread condemnation by the United Nations and other international organizations and improved co-operation in implementing measures to deal with it  the serious threat posed by terrorism to human life and to international peace and security remains. Ambivalence with regard to terrorism and its perpetrators still persists. Along with our European partners  we have repeatedly and unambiguously condemned all acts of international terrorism  irrespective of the identities of those responsible  or their motivations. We must all ensure that the obligations we have assumed under international conventions are fulfilled; we must also pledge ourselves further to intensify existing bilateral and multilateral co-operation on practical anti-terror ism measures. Much of this can be carried out within the framework of the United Nations and its agencies  as exemplified by the work currently under way in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) . It behoves us all to do our utmost to see that terrorism ceases to be a threat to the orderly conduct of international relations.An area of United Nations activity with which public opinion in my country has strongly identified is the work undertaken in the field of human rights. On the eve of the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we recall the great debt owed to the framers of that document. Its assertion of inalienable rights to which every human being may lay claim represents a landmark in the struggle to secure freedom and justice for all. On the basis of that foundation  much valuable work has been done in the intervening years in the preparation of international instruments designed to expand and deepen the scope of the human rights canon. Despite the existence of this impressive framework  violations of human rights  often on a serious scale  continue to occur. We call for a renewed commitment of effort on the part of all Member States so that each individual can effectively enjoy those rights to which he is formally entitled.In his statement to the Assembly on 22 September the Foreign Minister of Denmark  speaking on behalf of the Twelve member States of the European Communities  addressed many of the regional conflicts with which we are confronted. I should like today to comment on the situation in those areas which  in the view of my delegation  give cause for particular concern. First  the divisions and instabilities of the Middle East  on which I have already touched  remain a matter of consistent concern and high priority. We were greatly encouraged in the course of this year by the growing momentum towards the convening of an international conference  which we believe is the most timely and effective approach to bringing about a comprehensive and enduring peace in that area. We  in common with our European partners  have made clear our commitment to such an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations and our readiness to play an active role in assisting this process so far as we can. We urge all the parties concerned to renew and intensify their efforts to overcome those obstacles and difficulties which still stand in the way of the convening of a conference. We appreciate and support the Secretary-General's efforts to this end and with this purpose in mind.We have followed with deepening concern the mounting toll of death and destruction as well as the growing threat to international peace and security posed by the conflict between Iraq and Iran. We appeal to the two belligerent countries to recognize the futility of continuing this war. We urge them to respond to the call of the Security Council for a cease-fire leading to a negotiated settlement. I would recall that we  the Members of this Organization  have conferred on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General in the exercise of his good offices  with the aim of ensuring compliance with the Security Council resolution.Elsewhere in that region  in Lebanon  religious and communal antagonisms continue. We are among those countries whose citizens are innocent victims of the hostage-taking and kidnapping  which has been a particularly deplorable characteristic of the continued violence in that country. We unreservedly condemn this practice and appeal to all parties and forces in Lebanon to co-operate in securing the immediate release of all innocent victims· We urge all parties to show restraint so that reconciliation  national dialogue and reconstruction can commence. The cycle of violence must be broken as a necessary pre-condition for a peaceful solution based on respect for the sovereignty  unity  independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon.South Africa remains a source of serious concern to the whole international community· The events of the last year have brought no comfort to those who hope to see the apartheid system dismantled and the emergence in South Africa of a multiracial democracy in its stead· Massive repression continues unabated and censorship  in fact  has been greatly strengthened. Many thousands have suffered loss of freedom under the state of emergency  in addition to the iniquities that are inflicted daily on them by the apartheid system. The Government of South Africa continues to defy international opinion and has yet to demonstrate clearly that it is prepared to engage in genuine reform and to commence meaningful political dialogue with the authentic leaders of the majority community.The steps which have been taken to maintain the apartheid system have had a malign influence elsewhere in the southern Africa region. Ireland has frequently condemned the continued activities of South Africa in seeking to destabilize its neighbours whether through armed incursions into their territories by its security forces support for paramilitary movements opposed to the Governments of its neighbours  or the application of economic pressure.On Namibia  I call again on South Africa to desist from further obstructing progress towards Namibian independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). This resolution remains the basis for Namibian independence and the world community should continue to demand its implementation by South Africa. The Introduction of extraneous elements linking progress towards a Namibian settlement with developments elsewhere in the region is not acceptable.The rapid withdrawal of Soviet troops  in accordance with an irrevocable timetable  remains the essential pre-condition if the long conflict in Afghanistan is to be brought to an end. A political solution must guarantee the Afghan people's right to self-determination  allow the return of the refugees and the re-establishment of Afghanistan's status as an independent and non-aligned country  we reaffirm our support for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and the principles set out in successive United Nations resolutions.	-We remain convinced that the basis for a just and lasting solution to the conflict in Kampuchea is contained in the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea  which calls for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the exercise by the Kampuchean people of their right to determine their own future. In the event of a withdrawal  effective steps should also be taken to prevent any armed group from seizing power by force or resorting to the threat of force to intimidate the Kampuchean people and thereby deprive them of their right to choose their own destiny. Kampuchea must be free both of foreign troops and of any prospect of a return to the appalling activities of the Khmer Rouge.The agreement signed by the five Central American Presidents in Guatemala City in August has greatly enhanced the prospects of peace in that region and has given very real hope that the urgently needed improvements in the areas of human rights and social justice will be undertaken. We congratulate the Governments concerned on taking this Important step towards achieving national reconciliation and the strengthening of democracy and on their renewed commitment to the objectives of the United Nations Charter and of the draft Contadora Act. We look forward to the full implementation of the agreement while being keenly aware of the extent of the difficulties that have yet to be overcome. We urge the Governments Involved to maintain their efforts and call on all other States in a position  to do so to facilitate the peace process undertaken and now under way.I have mentioned some of the regional conflicts which are the cause of particular concern. However  for millions of people  the immediate threat to their security and well-being is not a military or a political one. Their well-being is being continuously threatened by a lack of development. Many millions still lack the basic conditions for a decent life. Their condition is as much the concern of this Organization as is any other aspect of its purposes and principles.The present Insecure world economic environment - characterized by slow growth  sluggish trade and low commodity prices - provides a sombre background to our deliberations on global issues of development. The unfavourable economic environment affects us all. In my own country  the slow-down in world trade has contributed to high unemployment. A heavy debt-service burden has forced our Government to impose severe cut-backs on public expenditure. However  no country or group of countries has been as seriously and severely affected by the slow-down in world growth as have the least developed countries  particularly those of sub-Saharan Africa. In this regard I welcome the initiative which the Secretary-General has taken in establishing an advisory group to study and report on the balance-of-payments and debt crises as obstacles to the economic recovery of many African countries. The Interrelated issues of resources for development  commodities  international trade and the problems of the least-developed countries were considered at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  in July. The discussions at the Conference showed welcome evidence of a readiness on the part of all countries to work together to improve the environment for accelerated and sustained development. The Final Act of the Conference reflects the broad understanding that was reached on the need for a number of policy approaches and concrete measures to address and deal with these problems.The successful outcome of UNCTAD VII has also contributed to the restoration of confidence in our ability to tackle development questions within the framework of the United Nations. In an increasingly interdependent world  solutions to such problems can be found only through multilateral co-operation. The universal nature of the United Nations system confers a unique authority on the conclusions of conferences such as UNCTAD and complements the valuable practical work being carried out in developing countries by the United Nations Development Programme and by the specialized agencies. The indispensability of a global approach to development problems was further brought out in the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development  published earlier this year. The challenge that faces the international community is to take the steps which we all agree are necessary in the interests of development and to make better use of the machinery of the United Nations to achieve our agreed objective.The problem of Northern Ireland continues to be of major concern to the Irish Government. In successive years Irish Foreign Ministers have come to the General Assembly to describe the dimensions of the problem and to underline the urgency of finding a durable solution. Since the meeting between the British and Irish Heads of Government in 1980  it has become an accepted principle that a solution to the Northern Ireland problem is to be found in the framework of Anglo-Irish co-operation. Out of that process emerged the Anglo-Irish Agreement between the British and Irish Governments  signed in November 1985 and registered here with the United Nations.The Anglo-Irish Agreement represents both a commitment and a challenge for the British and Irish Governments. For our part  the Irish Government which came into office in March of this year is determined to use the mechanisms of the Agreement to improve the position of all the people living in Northern Ireland and especially the members of the Nationalist community. Within our overall programme for action we have established certain priority areas where we believe change is urgently required. These areas include the achievement of fair employment practices and reforms in the administration of justice.As indeed the United Nations and its specialized agencies have recognized in many pronouncements  equal opportunity in employment is one of the hallmarks of an acceptable society. The socio-economic rights of individuals must rank equal in importance with their political and other rights. The employment profile of Northern Ireland undoubtedly points to a legacy of discrimination against one community. It is the common objective of the British and Irish Governments to ensure the elimination of that discrimination in all its forms  some steps have been taken along the road but there is much further to travel. We regard the removal of discrimination in employment as both a moral and a political imperative in Northern Ireland and as a sine qua non of further progress in that area.Public confidence in the administration of justice and good relations between the security forces and the community are other distinguishing marks of a normal society. When emergency measures are deemed necessary in order to protect the public from violence it is essential that the public security forces are even-handed and that the proceedings of the courts are impartial. In a divided society such as Northern Ireland  where a very large minority of the population has felt alienated from the institutions of government and especially from the forces of law and order and the system of justice  the importance of such public confidence is very acute. In Northern Ireland  therefore  it is necessary to consider what changes are required to remedy the damage done to public confidence in the past and to assure public confidence now and for the future. That is why  in the Anglo-Irish Agreement  of 15 November 1985  and in the communiqué which accompanied it  the British and Irish Governments agreed to seek measures which would give substantial expression to the aim of public confidence in the administration of justice and committed themselves explicitly to early progress in that area.It is easy to be misled into thinking that the conflict in Northern Ireland centres upon irreconcilable religious or historical differences. In fact the challenge which lies at the heart of the problem is similar to many of the challenges posed by other areas of conflict throughout the world which are raised regularly in this Assembly. The need for peoples and nations freely to work out their own future  the accommodation of historical differences within such nations peacefully and by agreement and related human rights questions are basic to many of the tensions and much of the instability throughout the globe  no less than in Northern Ireland.The role of the Irish Government under the Anglo-Irish Agreement offers support to Nationalists in Northern Ireland in ending that sense of exclusion under which they have lived and in finding solutions to the problems which beset both communities in that area. We also believe that the Irish Government's role reflects the recognition by the two Governments concerned and by the overwhelming majority of the populations of Britain and Ireland that the Nationalist and Unionist communities both share a common future on the island of Ireland which must rest upon principles of inclusion and accommodation of both traditions.In saying this  my Government recognizes that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has not gained full acceptance in Northern Ireland. We recognize the rights and the identity of the Unionist population as well. There must  however  be a realistic acceptance that the Agreement is there as part of the political landscape in Northern Ireland and has been achieved by the two sovereign Governments involved in that island. Only in such a climate of realism can meaningful debate take place about future political developments.In successive years we have called for an end to the campaigns of violence in Northern Ireland. The past year has  unfortunately  seen a continuation of that futile violence which has brought such misery and suffering to the people of the area. The perpetrators of that violence are a tiny minority of the population of Northern Ireland who do not act on behalf of anybody but themselves. Indeed  their unremitting campaigns of violence and assassination can only add to the mistrust and mutual fear between Irish people of different traditions. Such actions do not bring closer but postpone the day when unity based on reconciliation can take place in Ireland  leading to the coming together  under agreed structures  of all the people of diverse traditions in our island.We  as the Irish Government  will continue to work the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in conjunction with the British Government. We will remain open to contact with all those in Northern Ireland willing to pursue peaceful constructive approaches to the problems of the area. We will seek to make progress on the practical level of economic fairness  even-handed treatment by the security forces and confidence in the administration of justice  all of which deeply affect the ordinary citizen in his or her everyday life. We realize that progress at the overall political level is indispensable to a durable settlement  by agreement  of the problems of our country as a whole.Similarly  in the world at large regional problems of a similar kind can only be resolved by the exercise of positive political will on the part of the countries immediately involved.

"68",3289,"IRN",42,1987,"﻿O Lord  with Thy holy name I begin and from Thee I seek guidance and support. My life and death  my petition  prayer and praise belong to Thee. I beseech Thee to grant the clarity and magnetism of the word of truth to my utterances and make them a message for the millions of people who passionately thirst after truth and for those who shall  in the future  seek the truth. 0 God Almighty  my nation and I offer our thankful salutations to the souls of Thy great prophets  in particular  Abraham  Moses  Jesus and Mohammad - Thy peace be upon them - who did their utmost and gave their lives in order to spread and immortalize the message of awareness and salvation of man  and our humble salutations to the pure and enlightened hearts who obeyed Thy message  especially to those among them who sacrificed their lives because of it.My country has been a centre of man's civilization and culture at some important  elevated stages of history and at present is the setting for a political system based on the same cultural background and traditions  which are now further enriched by an Islamic awakening. I come here from a land which is the birthplace of a more famed but Less understood revolution in contemporary history  a revolution founded on the religion of God  marching along the path of the prophets and great spiritual reformers  a path as long as the history of mankind.Islam's Unitarian theory is the unshakable foundation and the fundamental thinking of this revolution. The meaning of man  the interpretation of history  the analysis of past  present and future events  the concept of the material world  the explanation of elements that bind man to the world outside him  the earth  human beings and objects  man's understanding of his own existence - in short  everything that goes into the formation of human society's value system to attain an orderly human administration - are rooted in and emanate from this divine outlook. In Islamic thought all existence is the creation of God and an image of His knowledge and power; the whole universe is attracted to Him and man is His creature superior to others and His heir on earth.Exploiting his intrinsic talents man can build the world created for him in the most beautiful ways and  flying on the two wings of faith and knowledge  rise to the highest spiritual and material peaks. Conversely  man can create a hell of oppression and corruption by going astray and wasting and perverting his God-given potential. The only light illuminating his path is belief in God and submission to His commands. The temporal world is a cultivating ground for the next world and death is not the end of life but only a passage to immortality and the beginning of a new existence.In Islam's divine thought all mankind are brothers and sisters and creatures of the Almighty. There is no discrimination because of colour  race  sex or geographical location of people and these distinctions do not make one man or a nation superior to others. When racial and geographical characteristics are disregarded  an act of aggression against a person is aggression against humanity.The feeling of superiority and monopoly has set brother against brother  and the blood that has flowed has never dried. The same motives and the same actions created streams of blood and  finally  seas of blood have appeared between those seeking superiority and domination and the victims of such arrogance. In this way peace has been taken out of man's life.The prophets invited people to submit to God  because this crushes the feeling of egocentrism and superiority in man and offers him the purity and tranquillity of a paradise on earth before the eternal one in heaven. They persuaded man to control his instinct of domination and superiority. They also warned against wasting human potential and slipping into the mire of moral corruption. They opened fountains of virtuousness  honesty  love  work  initiative  knowledge and consciousness and they stressed the love of God and His blessing of people  which are man's only insurance against perversions and are a guarantee of the sublimation of his soul.They taught man to use his power to safeguard these values  to block the path of the intruding satans of corruption and perversion  to fight ignorance and the cruelty of slavery  to safeguard knowledge  justice and freedom. They taught him neither to oppress nor to let others oppress him  they taught him to rise in defence of equity and justice and not to give evil a chance. They also taught him that surrendering to enemies of justice  virtuousness and charity only results in the destruction of these values and amounts to acquiescence in evil  oppression and corruption. In Islam's divine thought the religion of God is not only the crowning of man's virtuousness  but the very form of life itself. Religion offers man a complete social system  not merely some forms of worship and certain traditions  even though services of worship and traditions are full of the spirit of life and serve the same system. The social system is based on the same religious outlook. Freedom and liberty  the equality of people  social justice  awareness of society's individuals  the combating of corruption and perversion  the superiority of human ideals over individual desires  the rejection of satanic domination  personal behaviour and ethics  and occupational and political scrupulousness are all born of and inspired by the same universal interpretation of the world and man. Islam rejects as immoral all systems founded on force  oppression  ignorance  suppression  tyranny and humiliation of man through discrimination on grounds of race  nation  blood or language It commands the faithful to approach with love  affection and support all mankind  co-religionist or not  except those determined to fight the Islamic order  who must be faced uncompromisingly.It was on such basic principles and with such objectives that an Islamic revolution emerged in Iran and laid the foundations of an Islamic republic. Many analysts have searched for the roots of the Islamic revolution in February 1979  and many of them have failed to understand it correctly. In our opinion  this great event was partly a consequence of the inefficiency of the existing systems in the world and the emptiness and falsehood of the slogans of democracy and equality in those systems. Islam was able once again to shine in this dark atmosphere through the dust of distortions and misconceptions thrown in its way for many centuries. The sun of Islam shone on Iran and brought about a revolutionary storm. It is expected to shine on many other parts of the world. We must wait and see. But  despite earfuls of adverse propaganda  the awakening of Muslims in many Islamic countries is not an offspring of Iran's Islamic revolution; it is its brother-in-Islam.Iran is located at one of the most sensitive sites of strategic importance. It has a background of science and culture and abounds in material resources. The Islamic revolution in Iran was meant to be against a regime that had put all this at the service of the interests of the imperial-minded Powers of the world  particularly those of the United States of America  for almost a quarter of a century. Nobody needed the spiritual and material wealth of Iran more than the Iranian people  but they were denied it. The ancient regime's claims of progress and modernization were all false  but the West's propaganda machine  especially its Zionist component  keep publicizing them. It was such a regime that the Islamic revolution toppled  proposing its own significant goals. Nine years have passed  yet it is still felt that the answers too many questions are not quite clear. The fact is that in the case of our revolution and our views and principles much more uninformed opinion and evil talk has been heard than in other cases.1 shall now try  for the benefit of those interested in truth  to shed light on certain exceptional aspects which give different characteristics to this revolution. I shall end my statement with a brief message.First  the revolution was from its beginnings a people's revolution - totally  100 per cent. None of the familiar forms that have been instrumental in certain other revolutions were active or even present in our revolution: no armed guerrilla groups  no active military-political party  no groups of revolutionary  free officers and the like. There were only people  and unarmed people at that  who filled Tehran and other cities and towns in Iran with their presence. They crowded the streets and filled the air in the cities with their revolutionary presence and revolutionary slogans  in such a way that there was no room to breathe for the ruling clique and its government·  they simply had to leave their castles and centres of power and  one by one or in groups  to leave the country hastily. The Shah  the Prime Minister  generals of the army  ministers and other important criminals fled the country when they could to avoid the wrath of the people.This  of course  happened after a long year during which the regime had exploited all the political  military and police resources at its service to disperse people and force them back to work or to their houses  and in order to achieve this had shot and killed thousands of them in the streets  in the mosques  in the universities and in their workplaces  openly and indiscriminately. Despite all these measures  however  the people's presence had increased. In the very last months  when the regime became more violent  the people came out in millions. The regime  cracking under the pressure of people who no longer had any regard for their lives  could not withstand the onslaught of the masses and was forced to make its greatest concession; it sacrificed the Shah  He fled the country  never to return  and after this the regime's retreat accelerated.The great leader of the revolution  whose every word to every individual Iranian was a lesson in awareness  resolve and purpose  was able to announce the formation of a revolutionary administration with trust in God Almighty  Who encompasses all other powers  and with reliance on the people's indomitable will. The Shah's tyrannical rule  which was left with no option  collapsed automatically and melted away. The last bastions of the regime were barracks with no soldiers or officers  in the last hours a few garrisons showed some resistance  but all was in vain  because people were everywhere and overcame them. The miracle of this revolution was the victory of the people. It was only after the collapse of the military garrisons that arms fell into the hands of the people·  but then the kingdom had already collapsed and these weapons were used for the protection of the new revolutionary order. People  young and old  men and women  were the agents who defeated the Shah's regime  which was armed to the teeth and enjoyed the support of the biggest Powers. It was the people who established the order of an Islamic republic  and their weapons were their faith  their determination and their blood - and blood overcame the sword. The doctrine of blood overcoming the sword is the old policy of the oppressed resisting and fighting the oppressor that was declared by the leader of our revolution long before it took place. Thus the first victory of our revolution was against the armed regime of the Shah  who was strongly backed by the West and the United States  It has since gained us other victories  some of which may even be rated as more important than defeating the Shah. This unique experience - unique at least in the last century - deserves to be carefully studied by both the oppressed nations and those oppressive Powers which underestimate the power of the people.Secondly  this revolution had its roots in religion  in Islam. There have been many revolutionary movements in history the combative spirit of which was fuelled by a religious faith  but little or no account has been taken of this factor by many analysts. In our revolution  however  everything was taken from Islam; its aims  its principles and its methods of struggle  as well as the formation of the new order and the particular form of its administration.This fact gives certain surprising dimensions to the definition of revolution and new meanings to its victory. As we know  Islam has been a target of assaults for the last century and a half by colonial Powers and their subservient  reactionary agents exactly because of its inexhaustible capacity for revolution and reconstruction. Furthermore  Islam is a sacred faith and a divine religion in more than 50 countries and among some 1 000 million Muslims and  therefore  a revolutionary victory the spirit and substance of which is derived from Islam is in fact the victory of those billion people over all historic invaders against Islam. It is for this reason that hundreds of millions of Muslims in dozens of Islamic countries have welcomed the victory of our revolution. This religious characteristic also stops the people  the leader of the revolution and its administrators from any retreat  defeat  fear or weakness  when you fight for God there is no defeat  let alone fear  weakness or retreat.Thirdly  non-reliance on either East or West was another exceptional characteristic of this revolution and is now the fundamental policy of out revolutionary system.This in itself is one of the manifestations of the belief and trust in God in all spheres of our individual and social life. The dominant thinking in the political world today believes that without reliance on one of the power blocs no movement may survive in the contemporary political world. There may be a difference of emphasis about this but there seems to be no argument on the sacred principle. There are also people who  ideologically speaking  endorse non-reliance or non-alignment but do not suppose  pragmatically speaking  that it could work. Our revolution has  in such an atmosphere  offered a new philosophy and followed it most sincerely. Our revolution proved that the imperial-minded Powers may be ignored  that their bullying tactics may be resisted and that blackmailing may not be effective provided that there is belief in a power much more powerful than all material powers; belief in God Almighty We know quite well that for this belief and in this struggle we have to pay a heavy price and we are prepared for it.Let this experience illuminate the path of nations to true independence and the total rejection of the hegemony of the big powers; the present division of power threatens humanity with a very bitter future.Fourthly  there is another peculiarity to our revolution — very active to the present; it had to suffer an incredible amount of hostility and receive many exceptional blows. Certainly no revolution is safe from the counter-strikes of the power system dominating our world but the variety  the depth and the enormity of the enmities and the wild anger unleashed against us for the last nine years is an exceptionally interesting story to hear.The revolution had not yet reached its climax when hostile behaviour mostly by the United States of America started to challenge it. Certain officials  who reveal secrets through the passage of time  now confess that in the last months of the Shah's tyrannical regime the United States Administration  the President and his national security adviser tried to hearten the Shah by encouraging him to be ""more decisive"". The meaning of ""decisiveness"" was later explained in the statements of a fellow called General Huyser who had come to Tehran as the special representative of the President of the United States of America. In his opinion and according to advice given to him  the Shah's regime had to be safeguarded even if this resulted in the slaughtering of tens of thousands of people. And his incredible justification was: ""It would be preferable to the killing of many more thousands later"". In the honourable opinion of the United States authorities it was not valid that if the United States did not interfere in the internal affairs of Iran  neither the blood of tens of thousands then nor the blood of ""many more thousands later"" had to be shed!Certainly there was no other reason for the abortiveness of Huyser's mission and his flight from Tehran as well as for the arrest or flight of all those elements whom the United States needed for the carrying out of its evil plans except the crushing ferocity of revolutionary waves and the great might of a nation who had risen to fight for God and feared nothing but God. It was not the enemies of revolution who simply walked off; it was the revolution that forced them to flee. They had already exerted all their pressure at the hands of the treacherous Shah. After the victory of the revolution  hostile plots were hatched in a variety of forms. The very first clever measure was the infiltration of revolutionary posts and positions by enemy agents and the second was the organizing of all sorts of ""opposition"" parties and groupings in a free  political atmosphere after decades of dictatorship and suppression. In the former case it is interesting to note that a loyal agent who  a few weeks after the revolution  was tried in a revolutionary court and executed for treason had  by hook or by crook  got himself appointed as the commander of the Air Force in the first days of the revolution! And in the latter it would suffice to say that in the very first months after our victory some 400 political parties and groups surfaced in Iran that included anything from Loyalist to Communist to Separatist to Pan-Iranist. And it should not  of course  be forgotten that certain foreign embassies in Tehran  especially the embassy of the Arch-Satan  were the centres that organized some of these groups and helped them financially and ideologically!A bloody  merciless kind of terrorism was another vengeful hostility towards our revolution. Terrorist groups who lacked any form of popular base  by stealing arms and ammunition and explosive material  not a difficult job in those chaotic days of revolution  and through the assistance of certain foreign governments  established a vast  terrorist network in Iran. individual and group assassinations  colossal bomb explosions  the hijacking of aircraft  kidnapping  horrible incidents of torture  indiscriminate shootings and the deliberate slaughtering of people were among the measures carried out in Iran by some terrorist groups supported and encouraged by the infamous enemies of our revolution. The victims of this barbarous violence represented all strata of Iranian society; they Included important leaders and authorities of the revolution  as well as ordinary people such as the oppressed workers and toilers  men and women and  of course  innocent children and passers-by.Today  the leaders of these terrorist groups  who have often claimed responsibility for their criminal actions  are given security and protection and are provided with a comfortable life in the United States  France and some other Western countries and go by the euphemism of ""opposition to the Revolution""; and the countries that patronize these terrorists accuse the Islamic Republic of Iran of ""terrorism"". An astonishing paradox of politics is that the innocent victims of a blind  barbarous terrorism are themselves accused of ""terrorism"" by those who helped establish these terrorist groups and are at present looking after them well.As the President and servant of my country  and as a victim of a savage terrorist attack  which was aborted by the will of the Almighty  I have the honour to declare here that none of these brutalities  none of this shedding of blood  could shake the will of our people despite the fact that the extent of the terrorism was unprecedented: in one act alone  some 72 leading members and administrators of the revolution  including several cabinet ministers  a score of deputies of Parliament  and some irreplaceable personalities of our revolution  such as Martyr Ayatollah Beheshti  died inhuman deaths; and in another incident the President and the Prime Minister were blown to death together. But these brutal atrocities have served only to strengthen the people's faith and trust in God and to increase their revolutionary wrath. Military coups d'état are the traditional  sanguinary experiment in all revolutions organized by the great Powers. In the case of the Iranian revolution they were organized many times and in one case reached a very dangerous state. Had it not been for our people's support and for the vigilance of our officials  the predictions of the American General that there would be several blood-baths and the massacre of millions of people would have materialized.But the greatest  the most painful and the most catastrophic act of hostility by our enemies was the imposition of war on our revolution  that is  the stirring of the ambitious instincts of a neighbour  persuading it to invade and assuring it of all sorts of assistance and support.Today  after some seven years of war  it is quite clear to all that the invasion of Iran by the Iraqi army on 22 September 1980  that is  19 months after the establishment of the Islamic Republic  was in fact aimed at defeating the revolution and at the overthrow of the Islamic Republic. The invasion was carried out with some 10 divisions and hundreds of fighter-bombers; they attacked from the ground  from the air and from the sea. There were also such expansionist aims as the annexing of a province of Iran  a fact that has frequently been confessed to in the Iraqi press and publications as well as in articles by non-Iraqi paid pens. The Iraqis have  more often than expected  declared both these goals openly and in a revealing way.What Iraq anticipated as a reward for this invasion  apart from the stabilizing of its internal situation  was to emerge as the dominant Power in the region or at least in the Arab sphere. This would have been a lot for the nonentities ruling Iraq  access to a considerable coastal border in the very important Persian Gulf region was certainly another motive. By an Iraqi victory which would accompany Iran's defeat  its disintegration and the collapse of the Islamic Republic  the imperial-minded Powers would also reach an important goal: the removal of a new system which had disturbed the existing political-economic balance and put an end to the influence of big Powers  especially that of the United States  in the event of our defeat  the circumstances would be back to ""normal"" for the United States and some others  and the same old story of political and economic influence would be repeated.We were at first taken by surprise  we should admit. Our preoccupation with innumerable internal problems relating to the revolution and our lack of sufficient experience made the invasion possible; but the particular characteristics of this revolution came to our rescue: within a few months the heroic  miraculous efforts and sacrifices of our people and their armed forces had resulted in the liberation of a large part of the occupied territories. Nevertheless  the catastrophic effects of this invasion are beyond description; prosperous cities such as Abadan  Khorramshahr  Hovaizeh and Qasre-Shirin were razed to the ground; even the small city of Dezful was hit by some 250 ground-to-ground missiles; numerous happy villages of which not even a half-smashed wall is left; factories that were turned into piles of metal rubble; numerous farms that were wiped out; invaluable cultural monuments that have been seriously damaged; and  most important of all  the innocent people who lost their precious lives.The committing of war crimes  such as savage attacks against civilian  residential areas; the massacre of thousands of defenceless women and children; the imprisonment of passengers and passers-by on the occupied roads - all in the first weeks of the war - violations of international commitments and regulations  such as the use of chemical weapons on a large scale  air attacks on commercial ships  civilian aircraft and passenger aeroplanes and trains  are some examples of acts on the part of the Iraqi regime in the course of this war that have been identified but are continuing.After the initial war efforts  when the people of Iran had time to think over and sum up the events  they realized a very bitter fact  namely that security based on the promises and commitments of a warmongering aggressor has no validity and that trusting in such security is illogical and very naive.The Head of the Iraqi regime had publicly announced that its Agreement with the Iranian Government in 1975  otherwise known as the Algiers Agreement  was signed at a time when Iraq was weak  and therefore it was not binding or valid any more. He tore a copy of the Agreement to pieces and a few days later invaded Iran.This was a bitter but enlightening lesson for the Iranian nation. From that moment on  our people  awakened and revolutionary  took a decision and set a clear objective for their efforts. They decided not only to liberate the occupied territories and seek war compensation - to both of which they are unambiguously initiated  despite the fact that they could not be compensated for a great part of the damages - but also  as a more important goal  to punish and remove the aggressor. By proposing the punishment of the aggressor we have sought not only a secure base for our national security but also security and stability throughout the region. If an aggressor is once punished by the international family of nations for its aggression  we can rest assured that the aggressor instinct  which is often found in evil and opportunistic elements  will be suppressed for many years to come  and our region  and perhaps the whole world  will not have to suffer the catastrophic consequences of unprovoked aggressive wars.The Nuremberg Trials have guaranteed some 40 years of peace and security for the war-addicted European States. Why should we discard the experience of Nuremberg?When thousands of square kilometres of our country were under occupation  the big Powers  exploiting their powerful weapons of publicity  put us under very heavy pressure to accept a cease-fire in return for the formation of a committee that would arrange for the invader to return to international borders. This would have meant our leaving part of our existence  our honour and our dignity under the feet of the enemy and soliciting the attention of this or that international committee in the hope of regaining our integrity. There could have been no bigger insult to the intelligence of an honourable revolutionary nation. Even the least informed people in the world have the sanguinary tragedy of the Palestinian people before their eyes and would reject such tyrannical proposals. If imposed cease-fires and deceitful  empty promises had restored the legitimate and obvious rights of the Palestinian nation  they might also help others to regain theirs.In our case  even today  when we have liberated the largest part of the occupied lands through the heroic efforts of our people and at the cost of their precious blood  with some parts such as Naft-Shahr still under occupation  we believe that our most important task is to punish the aggressor. And today  when we look back at the irrecoverable cost of this imposed war  we consider this more important than ever and believe that without punishment of the aggressor any other achievement would be a loss for our people. As a nation which has borne the burden of a seven-year war  we long more than anybody else for peace  but we believe that that peace  a lasting peace  can be established only with punishment of an aggressor who has added many other sins to the original sin of aggression since it started the war.Today  as in 1975 Iraq is again in a weak position and everyone knows this. The kind of peace approved by the Iraqi regime today would  after a few years or whenever it suspected itself to be in a strong position  evaporate in a moment  and another war would engulf the region. The only guarantee for the future is punishment of the aggressor.Peace is  without a doubt  a beautiful and attractive word. This is so true that even the biggest international warmongers and the producers of weapons for global destruction flirt with it and love it hypocritically. But  in our opinion  justice  a word that the powerful and the oppressors regard with fearful caution  is even more important and more beautiful.The number of those who have given up their well-being  their peace and their life to secure justice is not small. These people are always recognized as great heroes. European cities still take pride in their resistance against Hitler's aggression; Moscow still prides itself on a self-burning that astonished and disappointed Napoleon's army and Leningrad on its four-year-long resistance when besieged by the Nazi invaders.The United Nations in particular has an obligation  according to the very first Article of its Charter  to secure justice through the special process of taking measures against acts of aggression. And this is all that we expect from the world and from the United Nations. The big Powers have hypocritically called the war imposed on us a meaningless war  but at the same time they have consistently supported the initiator of and aggressor in this war politically  militarily and economically.There is no doubt that starting such wars is always meaningless  but as long as the aggressor was still hoping to achieve its evil end it was never called that.Today  however  this war is very meaningful for our people: it means selfless  heroic efforts to eradicate aggression and prove that nations have the power  in the face of the will of the big Powers  to defend their revolution  their stability and their integrity. Our nation  through a great deal of sacrifice  is engaged in rejecting a concept that has always resulted in aggression and war: the concept that reliance on advanced weapons and the support of the big Powers is a guarantee of success.In the last seven years the Iranian people have searched for the answer to an important question. Today I want to raise this question here from this rostrum. Why have all those Governments that know very clearly that it was the Iraqi regime that started the war and initiated aggression - and there is no scarcity of those that know this - chosen to remain silent vis-à-vis this great international crime? And why have the world mass media tended to ignore their great responsibility to the conscience of mankind and the interpretation of history in this case?Perhaps the key to the solution of this problem lies in the particular political relationships in our world today and the defective geometry created by the domination of the big Powers in international relations. However  our people seem to have discovered the facts.But the question to which no convincing answer may be found is this: why has the Security Council of the United Nations  as an organ that was created primarily to safeguard international security and oppose aggression  totally ignored its obligations and even acted in defiance of its duty? I think everyone knows that the Security Council did not show any reaction when Iraq invaded Iran on 1 OOO-kilometre front. The Iraqi army overran international borders in only a week and established itself at points ranging from 70 to 90 kilometres inside Iran. Some Iraqi authorities announced that their army intended to stay there forever..It was only after the establishment of this invasion that the Security Council issued its first resolution  on 28 September 1980. This resolution neither mentioned any aggression or occupation nor made a request for a return to international borders  but  astonishingly enough  called on both parties not to resort to any further use of force. What this really meant was total connivance in the occupation of the affected areas and a conquest to the Iraqi army not to advance further. And as far as Iran was concerned  it called on our people to stop fighting against the aggressor.This was the very first measure by the Security Council  in which it trampled upon all its principal obligations concerning the safeguarding of international peace and security in an ugly  tragic manner.After that  a deadly silence fell upon the Security Council for a long time - that is  up to the liberation of Khorramshahr through a military operation that broke the back of the occupation army and resulted in the humiliating capture of thousands of enemy soldiers and officers. Yet  up to that time  the Security Council had completely forgotten about the bloody  continuing war that headed the international news bulletins every day.Thus the Security Council suddenly remembered the Iran-Iraq war again. A few weeks after the liberation of Khorramshahr the Security Council's second resolution  dated 12 July 1982  was adopted. Now the Council called for a return to international borders. What it requested had already been achieved because our heroic people and their selfless and valiant combatants had by then liberated the greater part of the occupied lands. This resolution  too  was conspicuous for its many omissions: no reference to aggression; no mention of the aggressor; nothing about destruction  damages or any compensation; no guarantee of teal security and stability and not a word about punishing the agent of insecurity. The Council had chosen to be silent in its resolution about all those vital points.Therefore  once again  we found ourselves quite alone in restoring our legitimate rights  and I must inform the Assembly that the Security Council's stance in relation to the war that was imposed upon us has not changed up to this moment.Of course  the Secretary-General's independent initiatives went some way towards helping the United Nations in the realization of its objectives  but his good offices were not appreciated. I ought  however  to register a thankful note here for his efforts and his good offices. It would also be appropriate to remember the good name of the late Swedish Prime Minister  Mr. Olaf Palme  who  as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  sympathetically tried to help.The Secretary-General's trip to Tehran and the useful talks regarding Security Council resolution 598 (1987) were another step in that direction. We consider those talks objective and instructive  as is the report of the Secretary-General. Regrettably  it seems that some influential members of the Security Council wish to ignore that fact. They are the same members as have from the outset attempted to exploit that resolution as a means of exerting pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran. We have conveyed our unequivocal views to the Secretary-General and expect the Council to use correctly the possibilities open to it.Has the Security Council anything to say regarding the infringement of its very first obligation  to take measures against acts of aggression  which is stated in the first Chapter of the Charter to be the most important objective; what pressures has the Security Council brought to bear on Iraq in relation to threatening peace  breach of the peace and resort to force as mentioned in Chapter VII? Impartiality is the least that the Islamic Republic of Iran - a victim of a bloody  devastating aggression - can expect from the Security Council  because we all know that the Council's obligation is to take measures against acts of aggression and to support the victim of aggression  rather than remain neutral between the aggressor and the victim. But can the Security Council even claim that it has behaved impartially in this case?Our feeling is that the Security Council has been pushed into this indecent  condemnable position by the will of some big Powers  particularly the United States  Therefore  one may say that the foundations of the security supported by such a Security Council is nothing but a nice-looking house of cards. The nations of the world  especially the peoples of the third world  who wish to remain independent of the super-Powers  may never have the security guaranteed by such a Security Council.The fact that Iraq was never condemned for aggression has not only helped keep the imposed war going but also fanned its flames.And now  with the United States presence in the region and the presence of other countries that have followed as a result of the arch-satan1 a insistence and pressure  the Persian Gulf has turned into a dangerous powder-keg.At this juncture I must draw the attention of the General Assembly and the people of the United States urgently to the very grave and immediate danger provoked by the United States Administration through its latest action in the Persian Gulf  which is threatening not only the region but the whole world. Yesterday United States battleships attacked Iran Air  an Iranian merchant ship. They murdered four people and wounded three. The ship was seized and its crew detained  American television stations announced yesterday that United States battleships fired at this ship while it was laying mines in the waters  and thereby  as usual  told a pack of lies to the American people. But I declare here that the ship was a merchant vessel called Iran Air  not a military speedboat.This is the beginning of a series of events the bitter consequences of which will not be restricted to the Persian Gulf  and the United States  as the initiator of the trouble  will bear responsibility for all ensuing events. Should we now believe the passionate United States claims of a desire for peace and tranquillity in the Persian Gulf or this open  flagrant and concrete measure to fan the flames of war? I declare  very unambiguously  that the United States will receive a proper response to this abominable act. This is only one of the evil consequences of the imposed war and a direct result of the Security Council's inability to take proper measures against the Iraqi aggression. If the Security Council had condemned Iraq for starting the war  and later  for starting the so-called war of the cities  and Later  for attacking ships  today the United States would not dare threaten international peace and security so openly in spite of world public opinion  despite pressures from inside  and immediately after the adoption of resolution 598 (1987) for the preparation and adoption of which the United States had played a key role. Was resolution 598 (1987) only adopted to put pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran?I must here announce to the world and especially to the great people of the United States that the threatening  military presence of the United States in the Persian Gulf is yet another clear manifestation of the American regime's hostility towards the Iranian people.A big chapter of our history  a very bitter  bloody and evil chapter  is saturated with American enmities and grudging hostilities towards our nation some 25 years of support for the Pahlavi butcher and dictator  complicity with the Shah in all his crimes against our people  participation in plundering the wealth of the nation  serious confrontation with our revolution in the last months of the Shah's regime  persuading the dictator to suppress the millions-strong demonstrations of our people  employing all sorts of means and devices to obstruct the path of revolution in the first years of our victory  the constant  provocative contacts of the United States embassy in Tehran with counter-revolutionary elements  continuous help and assistance to terrorists and counter-revolutionaries outside Iran  freezing of the people's assets and property  non-deliverance of commodities that had been already paid for  non-payment of assets taken from the public treasury by the Shah and deposited in his own name in American banks  efforts for an economic blockade of Iran and the formation of a United Western front against our people  flagrant and effective support of Iraq in its war against us and now the bullying and illogical tactic of throwing an American armada into the Persian Gulf and seriously endangering peace and tranquillity of the region.These are pacts of our nation's indictment against the United States administration  an indictment that will bring under question all American claims for peace-loving and all statements by American leaders declaring their good intentions towards the Islamic Republic  which are apparently meant for internal consumption.The latest in the long list of American hostilities towards out nation was the bloody massacre of innocent  defenceless pilgrims at Mecca in the holy sanctuary of God at the hands of the Saudi regime where some 400 Iranian and non-Iranian pilgrims  mostly women  were martyred and a greater number were beaten  injured or maimed. There are certain indications that the United States played an influential part in this unprecedented  historical monstrosity.Do the United States administration and its Saudi stooges have any convincing explanation for the slaughtering of so many innocent men and women?Undoubtedly the culprits will try to justify their evil actions with some excuses and allegations but the nature of the incident with some 400 dead visitors mostly women on the one side and the local police armed with machine-guns  clubs and poison gas on the other is very revealing.Although blood that is shed wrongly at the hands of cruel  merciless tyrants will carry its clear message with it  not only for today but for all times  and will reveal the evil nature of the butchers  the Mecca incident also demonstrates the co-ordinated behaviour of the United States and the Arab reactionaries and unveils the secret co-operation of the two sides in the Persian Gulf region. This gives the incident an international dimension that must be carefully looked at by international forums.I must emphasize here that this indictment is directed against the leaders of the United States regime and not against the American people who  had they been aware of what their governments have done against another nation  would certainly endorse our indictment. Our people have shown that they have faith in their goals and are ready to defend them at the cost of their lives.Such a nation has no fear of the United States or any other Power and with the help of God it will prove that victory belongs to truth and the believers in truth.This was the story of our revolution. This revolution brought great hopes for nations which suffered from the oppression of the imperial-minded Powers  equally it provoked the violent hostility of the big Powers which seek to dominate the world. This storm of opposition  however  could not break off the young tree of this revolution because of its very deep roots. The tree was growing fast but it did withstand some very strong  damaging storms. And now the revolution is still alive despite the opposition of the big Powers and it shall certainly survived that is the dictate of divine traditions in history and it shall not be altered. And that is our most vivid and emphatic message.The system of domination had relentlessly tried to prove the contrary in order to make the nations of the third world believe that their fate is decided by the will of the big Powers. We have rejected and repudiated it. There is no doubt that the system of world domination did not wish the Islamic Republic to survive but our will overcame. Our message to all nations and Governments which wish to remain independent and ignore the wishes of the big Powers is to rely on their own people without any fear.The message of our revolution remains as it was the rejection of the doctrine of domination. Today our world is in fact divided among the big  imperial-minded Powers  They believe that they are the masters and owners of the world. In other words the world is divided into dominator and dominated parts and the dominator s decide on the fate of the dominated. The system of world domination feeds on the existence of unequal relations between the two parts. The system of world domination arbitrarily rejects revolution and creates problems for revolutionary regimes. Nicaragua and the countries of southern Africa are a few living examples.The system of world domination decides for peoples against their will. The innocent Palestinian nation is a perfect case and Afghanistan is another. The system of world domination fiddles with human ideas and concepts  changes and distorts them at will and tries to inject the distorted meanings into people's minds terrorism and human rights are two such manipulated concepts.The system of world domination is bold enough openly and directly to invade such countries as have aroused its anger. The United· States invasion of Libya and Grenada are two recent examples.The system of world domination makes decisions for the whole world and all nations. Yesterday it was Hiroshima and today the President of the United States is proud of the horrendous behaviour of his predecessors and even argues that if they did not kill those several thousands  mote people would have been killed throughout the world! The President of the United States does have a soft spot in his heart for all mankind - is he not the godfather of mankind?The system of world domination supports fascist and racialist regimes such as the ones in Israel and South Africa and employs them as bloodthirsty  armed agents to bully the oppressed nations. Muslim Lebanon  patiently resisting the criminal aggressions of Zionists  and the African front-line States are good examples.The system of world domination considers that it has the right to put pressure on international organizations; the Security Council and the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are living examples.The system of world domination believes that its own interests are absolute and the interests of others are non-existent. A good example of this is the dangerous  peace-threatening presence of American battleships in the Persian Gulf that have come to ""defend America's interests"" while completely disregarding the interests of the countries of the region.The system of world domination has  above all  the propaganda machine and the mass media of the world in its hands  distorts all the facts and gives a humane image to its satanic behaviour and in this way escapes confrontation with world public opinion. We believe that the nations and Governments of the third world as well as the peoples of the dominator countries should not tolerate this evil order of things. The big Powers must be told to go back home and leave the affairs of the world to its peoples. We must tell them: you are not anybody's legal guardians!In the United Nations there are two unjustified distinctions - the right of veto and permanent membership in the Security Council. These must be removed. And their removal would indeed turn the United Nations into a truly popular organization in which all problems may be solved. Otherwise the Security Council will remain  as it is today  a paper factory for issuing worthless and ineffective orders. And the peoples of the world will continue to think that there is no place for settling international problems and that the only option left is to use violence.Under these circumstances our message to the Governments of the third world  as long as the system of domination remains  is to unite with each other. This is the only way to become stronger. The Powers dominating our world do not value anything but power and we must speak with them in the only language they understand  the language of strength.The awakening of peoples and their awareness of the nature and function of the system of domination is the strongest support for the third world Governments and a source of real strength to resist the dominating Powers. The leaders of these Governments will have nobody to help them except the will  the power and the ideas of their own peoples.The union we propose to the third world countries is not a pact for fighting the big Powers; it will be a union for our own defence and the prevention of the usurpation of our legitimate rights.The dominating Powers are also the big agents for dissemination and justification of corruption: moral corruption  sexual corruption and ideological corruption. The political  economic and espionage motives of the big Powers are the true perpetuators of these moral perversions. And the fact is that in our world today  which includes the nations of the big Powers too  moral values have been discarded  the foundation of the family has been weakened  alcoholism and addiction to drugs have become rampant and spirituality and morality have become least appealing.We must start a tough campaign against corruption in our own countries. We must strengthen the foundation of the family and make this original school of man a home of affection  sincerity  love and spirituality. We must safeguard the rights and values of women. On this last issue  we must revise all the standards that were created by the system of domination and in order to liberate women from the humility of being ""sex objects"" that the dominant  Western culture has in practice imposed on them. Women as scientists  politicians  directors and managers  partners and mothers must be welcome but their exploitation as objects for pleasure  lechery and commercials should be rejected. This will help restore the dignity and personality of half of humanity and re-establish the lasting and holy foundation of the family.These are some of the messages of our revolution  not only for those eager to listen but also for those who can decide to listen to the truth and to welcome fairness and justice.

"69",3336,"IRQ",42,1987,"﻿It gives me pleasure to begin my statement by congratulating you  Sir  on the great trust accorded you by· the representatives of Member States in electing you President of the General Assembly  to wish you every success in your task.I should also like on this occasion to express my appreciation for the efforts of your predecessor  Mr. Choudhury  President of the last session of the General Assembly  who was entrusted with important tasks.More than seven years have now passed since the outbreak of the conflict between Iraq and Iran  during which time it has been discussed on many occasions in both the General Assembly and the Security Council. On all those occasions we expressed our views on the subject and my present statement will be limited to it alone.The war imposed on Iraq  as representatives know  is in the forefront of the Issues that concern my country at present and is also in the forefront of the Issues which preoccupy this Organization and the international community.Members will no doubt recall that 1986 was an important year in the course of the aggressive  expansionist war imposed by the Iranian regime on Iraq. In February of that year the Iranian regime invaded and occupied the Iraqi port city of Pao following its consideration of the grave situation in the area resulting from that act of aggression  the Security Council on the twenty-fourth of that month unanimously adopted its resolution 582 (1986)  which the members of the Council formulated independently  uninfluenced by either party to the conflict  and in which they set out the procedures for a comprehensive settlement in accordance with  the provisions of the Charter and the rules of international law. In the face of the rejection of that resolution by the Iranian regime  the Security Council considered the conflict once again and adopted unanimously  on 8 October 1986  resolution 588 (1986)  which affirmed the necessity of compliance with the previous resolution. Once again the Iranian regime rejected the resolution - a matter which led the Security Council to issue its statement of 22 December 1986 in which it reiterated its call for implementation of the comprehensive settlement procedures set forth in its resolution 582 (1986). The Iranian regime rejected that call  too Throughout that period the Iranian regime was making preparations for a large- scale operation to invade Iraq which its leaders named ""the final and decisive offensive"". At the same time  those very leaders were preparing for a meeting of their agents in Tehran for the purpose  as they claimed  of ""determining the future of Iraq"" in all its aspects. The said meeting began on 24 December 1986 and continued until the twenty-ninth of the same month  with direct and active participation of Iranian officials at the highest levels. On the night of 24/25 of that month  while the meeting was still in session  the Iranian regime launched a new invasion with the object of occupying the Basrah area  when its attempt was foiled  it undertook another operation on the night of 8/9 January 1987  also in the Basrah area. Yet another attempt was staged on the night of 13/14 of the same month in the central area of the front.The aims the Iranian regime intended to achieve by those operations are quite clear. Having failed over six years to occupy the whole of Iraq by large-scale offensives launched every year  that regime  in December 1986 and January 1987  targeted the Basrah area with a view to establishing therein a puppet government controlled by Iran  and proceeding thereafter to realize its dream of occupying the whole of Iraq  threatening the Arab Gulf States  and achieving regional expansion at their expense. The Israel people and its armed forces  however  thwarted those pernicious designs by dint of an ability based on deep faith in what is right and on the just cause of self-defence in the face of aggression and evil. Amidst these grave developments  on 13 January 1987 the Secretary-General of the United Nations issued a call for a meeting of the Security Council at the foreign ministers' level to discuss the situation between Iran and Iraq. The Secretary-General's initiative reflected a heightened state of concern for the grave implications of the continuation of the aggressive  expansionist war waged by Iran against Iraq. The intensified international efforts undertaken on the basis of this initiative were crowned by the unanimous adoption on 20 July last of a binding Security Council resolution  namely  resolution 598 (1987)  which expressed the wish of the international community to achieve peace without delay and promote a comprehensive  durable settlement of the conflict.Iraq expressed its position on the resolution in clear terms only two days after its adoption: it welcomed the resolution on the basis of a firm position of principle rooted in a commitment to peace and faith in resolving the conflict by peaceful means. Iraq stressed that it was prepared to implement the resolution as an indivisible whole and that it was keenly interested in having its provisions applied in full.Now Iraq did not welcome the resolution because it was an Iraqi resolution; nor did it do so because the resolution entailed any gains for Iraq. As a matter of fact  all the considerations pressed by Iran and those who worked behind the scenes in the Security Council to further Iran's interests were included in that resolution. Iraq welcomed resolution 598 (1987) because  in its view  it was a balanced resolution which contained the elements for a comprehensive settlement and because from the very beginning Iraq adopted the position of accepting the settlement of the conflict by peaceful means through the international Organization  on the basis of the Charter and international law.By contrast  from 20 July to date  the Iranian regime has manoeuvred for position vis-à-vis the resolution and engaged in procrastinatory and delaying tactics  while contriving such ruses in expressing its position on the resolution as have no parallel in the history of dealing with Security Council resolutions. This attitude of Iran can mean only rejection of the resolution and insistence on continuing the war and aggression. Then  after the Secretary-General's visit to Tehran the Iranian regime began to present its position on the resolution in evasive terms by focusing on the question of responsibility for starting the aggression as the principal issue - and that was what the President of Iran focused on in his statement here.I shall therefore concentrate in my statement on this important question and its details so as to reveal the truth and make it clear to representatives as it is  not as those who call for the continuation of the war  the killing and destruction wish to project it - although we have explained this Question on previous occasions and in many documents circulated in this Organization  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  and to the Member States.In 1979 when the new regime came to power in Iran  Iraq made a point of establishing good-neighbourly relations with it. That position by Iraq was an extension of its foreign policy and consistent with Iraq's paramount interests on the national and international levels. Iraq had among its priority concerns to ensure continuation of the comprehensive development plan that it had launched following the July 1968 Revolution  the advancement of the standard of living of the Iraqi people  the achievement of general evolution in the economic  cultural and social fields  and construction of the political and social institutions that enable the people to exercise their democratic rights.In the field of external relations the objectives of Iraqi foreign policy included the achievement of stability in the region  non-intervention in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries  and settlement of differences by peaceful means. Those were the principles proclaimed in President Saddam Hussein's declaration of February 1980. It was a policy which it pursued both officially and actually  internally and externally  and which qualified Iraq to be selected to host the Seventh Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Second Summit Conference marking the twentieth anniversary of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).The basic interests of Iraq and its prominent international position were most closely linked to the preservation of security and stability and the maintenance of the best of relations with its neighbours and the other countries of the world. Iraq had no interest in creating problems either with those neighbours or with any other country of the world. In line with that approach in its foreign policy  Iraq gave the new regime in Iran a friendly reception and was among the first States to accord it recognition. At a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran at the Havana Conference in 1979  President Saddam Hussein emphasized Iraq's concern to maintain neighbourly relations based on non-interference in internal affairs and co-operation aimed at serving the Interests of peace and stability in the region. Iraq emphasized this approach again at a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries at the United Nations.The Iranian regime  on the other hand  pursued an entirely different policy from the very beginning. The Iranian regime has  since its inception  maintained a hostile attitude towards Iraq. The regime  leadership expressed that attitude even before it came to power when  during his stay in France in 1978  Khomeini declared that changing the Government of Iraq constituted one of his priority objectives.The Iranian regime  by reason of its ideology based on the theory of the divine jurisdiction of the claimed Imam over the whole Muslim community in the world as expounded in Khomeini's book The Jurisdiction of the Pagih  that is  the leading theologian - a book which assumes in the Iranian system the same role as that of Hitler's Mein Kampf in Nazi theory - proclaims the principle of the exportation of the revolution outside Iran as a binding obligation on the constitutional authorities of the Iranian State. That is why work on the so-called export of the Iranian revolution has been the main preoccupation of the Iranian Government  the most important element in defining its external relations and activities  and the major cause of all the aggression  disorder and insecurity from which the region has been suffering from the time that regime came to power in Iran until today· In line with this anomalous course which it has insistently pursued  the Iranian regime has not concealed the fact that the primary objective of its revolution-exporting programme is to destroy the political and social system of Iraq  occupy Iraq and annex it as an Iranian dependency.While the occupation and subjugation of Iraq continue to be the primary objectives of Iranian expansionist plans  they are not by any means the only objectives. Ever since its inception the Iranian regime has resorted to terrorism and subversion and conducted propaganda campaigns against all the countries of the region and many countries of the world. It has committed open  armed aggression against Kuwait  Saudi Arabia and other countries of the region; and Iranian armed forces have occupied parts of Lebanon and raised the Iranian flag there.	-It was supposed that relations between Iraq and Iran would be governed by a standing Agreement  namely  the 1975 Agreement. The 1975 Agreement  with its special characteristics  had been concluded to regulate border issues between the two countries and questions of security and stability along these borders as well as to ensure non-interference in internal affairs. Article 4 states that any violation of any part of the Agreement shall constitute a violation of the Agreement as a whole.From the beginning the Iranian regime proceeded to attack this Agreement and to treat it as suspect. Officials of the regime at various levels began to issue declarations of non-compliance with its provisions. Those declarations are documented in the records we have submitted to this Organization and to other international bodies and institutions. Furthermore  the Iranian Government brought back to Iran the puppet Barzani gang of plotters  who pose a threat to the unity of Iraq  and assisted that gang in committing acts of sabotage against Iraq. Iran had supported that same gang in all sorts of ways before the conclusion of the 1975 Agreement  but then ceased to support it  in compliance with the provisions of that Agreement.These attitudes and acts constitute a deliberate  flagrant violation of the 1975 Agreement  as does the violation of other clauses providing for the return of Iraqi territories which Iran has been occupying since the time of the Shah's regime  and constitute an assault on the Agreement as a whole. By committing these deliberate acts Iran brought back the state of insecurity and instability along the common borders of the two countries. This state of affairs was the actual beginning of Iran's aggression against Iraq.Those hostile acts and attitudes  which threaten Iraq's sovereignty and its internal security and stability  continued throughout 1979 and for the first nine months of 1980. Iraq was careful to deal with these issues by diplomatic means and through dialogue. On scores of occasions Iraq drew the attention of the Iranian authorities to the fact that those acts constituted violation of the 1975 Agreement. On 27 June 1979 Iraq requested the Iranian Government to clarify its position on that Agreement. In spite of the gravity of this question as far as the relations between the two neighbouring countries were concerned  Iran did not take the trouble to respond to that substantive Inquiry from Iraq.Those violations were accompanied by other acts of no less gravity  all of which moved in the main direction of threatening Iraq's sovereignty and security and attempting to place Iraq under Iranian hegemony. During 1979 and 1980 countless feverish statements  declarations and speeches issued almost daily from officials of the Iranian regime calling: for changes in the political and social system of Iraq; for the promotion of acts of disorder and terrorism in Iraq and the employment of inhabitants of Iranian origin actually to commit such acts; for citizens to boycott and oppose the national authority and to paralyse governmental machinery; for the armed forces to rebel against authority  desert their barracks and evade national service; and openly for the assassination of political leaders in Iraq. I refer in particular to the statements made by the former Foreign Minister of the Iranian regime  Sadeq Ghotbzadeh  in Damascus on 27 April 1980  in which he announced an alleged plot against the life of the President of the Republic of Iraq.What was even more serious  Iranian officials began to speak openly and publicly of using their armed forces to achieve their designs against Iraq. I made special reference to the speech by the President of the Republic of Iran  Abol Hasan Bani-Sadr on 11 April 1980  in which he said:	·""When the Iranian army moves west no power on earth can stop its march to Baghdad.""No less serious was the announcement by Ghotbzadeh  the Foreign Minister  on 9 April 1980 that his Government had decided to overthrow the Iraqi Government  or his announcement the day before that Baghdad and Aden were Persian.Iranian officials at the time considered the making of ever more threatening statements against the security and sovereignty of Iraq to be a basic means of promoting their influence within the new regime and climbing to ever higher positions in the Iranian power structure  on the supposition that he who proved to be the roost extreme in that area would be closer to the Khomeini line of exporting the revolution and would thus be closer to his heart.With the continuation of these political and propaganda campaigns and campaigns of subversion to undermine security and stability  the Iranian regime began to use the force of arms against Iraq to achieve its aggressive aims. In the period from February to September 1980 Iranian aircraft committed 249 violations of Iraqi air space. There were 244 instances of Iranian armed forces firing across the border and on Iraqi border posts or subjecting them to attacks and artillery fire and obstructing navigation in Shatt al Arab  the vital artery of Iraq. We were also three instances of firing upon Iraqi civilian aircraft and seven instances of shelling Iraqi economic installations. In all these deliberate acts Iraq would give warning  call attention and engage in dialogue by diplomatic means in the hope that the Iranian regime would listen to the voice of reason and good sense  conform to the rules of international conduct and obey the dictates of international law. in 293 notifications by official memoranda dispatched to the Iranian authorities concerning these violations in the period from 5 March 1979 to 30 October 1980 the Iraqi Government drew attention to the risks involved in these acts and warned against their grave consequences for the relations between the two countries  but to no avail. The Iranian leaders continued to escalate their threats against Iraq and to compete with each other in discovering the best means to export their backward revolution to Iraq.On 4 September 1980 the Iranian regime moved to a dangerous level in its plan of aggression against Iraq. Iranian armed forces used heavy 175-millimetre artillery to shell the towns of Khaneqin  Mendell  Zirbatya and Naftkhaneh. Iranian artillery fired on these Iraqi towns from the Iraqi territories which it had refused to deliver back to Iraq as dictated by the 1975 Agreement and on which it had amassed military forces. The Iranian Government thereby deliberately threatened Iraq's sovereignty and security in two ways: on the one hand by a deliberate military occupation of Iraqi territory and on the other by a deliberate shelling of Iraqi towns by heavy artillery from that Iraqi territory.Although Iraq  by a memorandum dated 7 September 1980  called Iran's attention to this conduct  which was in contravention of its international obligations  and requested it to remove its military encroachments on Iraqi territory  Iranian artillery fire continued unabated. Iraq was therefore obliged again to notify Iran by an official memorandum dated 8 September that it was compelled to exercise its right to legitimate self-defence under the Charter and international law by removing the Iranian occupation forces should Iran fail to stop its military transgressions against Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity·Rather than respond to the Iraqi representations the Iranian authorities continued their military attacks on Iraq. We were therefore obliged for the third time  on 11 September 1980  to deliver to Iran a detailed official memorandum in which we suggested that the Iranian leadership seek the view of its organs responsible for border affairs and agreements as to the validity of the Iraqi position based on the binding commitments undertaken by both countries under the 1975 Agreement. The memorandum further urged the Iranian Government to realize that to attack heavily populated cities with their civilian inhabitants  as it did when it shelled Khaneqin and Mendel  could not be taken lightly; it was a grave matter which Iran should be careful to avoid if it did not wish the relations between the two countries to suffer serious deterioration· It is to be noted that on all occasions Iraq was careful to remind the Iranian Government of its International obligations  including the 1975 Agreement. It is also necessary to make note of the fact that as late as 11 September 1980 Iraq stressed to Iran  albeit for the last time  the need to abide by the provisions of the 1975 Agreement. How did Iran respond? Iran did not reply to our diplomatic memoranda in kind but resorted instead to threats and denunciations and continued to use military force against Iraq’s borders  cities  economic installations and essential facilities.Having long suffered all this with patience and made countless efforts to resolve matters  the Iraqi Government  faced with clear evidence and with the failure of the Iranian Government to respond to this historic memorandum  became convinced that the Iranian Government's violations of the elements of the comprehensive settlement contained in the 1975 Agreement were deliberate in character. Iraq therefore had no choice but to consider that Agreement and all subsequent agreements based thereon null and void  having regard to the fact that Iran had already nullified them by word and deed. Iraq's position was in accordance with the provisions of clause IV of that Agreement and article 4 of the Treaty on international Boundaries and Good-Neighbourliness  based on the Agreement.By accusing Iraq of nullifying the 1975 Agreement  Iran wants this Assembly and ourselves to ignore its own violations of the Agreement  whether those relating to Iraq's territorial sovereignty or external and internal security or those relating to non-intervention in its internal affairs  while maintaining at the same time  without officially recognizing the Agreement  the privileges therein accorded Iran to delimit boundaries in Shatt al Arab on the basis of the Thalweg line. The Iraqi diplomatic and legal attempts to draw Iran's attention to the gravity of the acts of aggression and threats it was committing and warning it against the dire consequences of such acts on the relations between the two countries were responded to by Iran with more threats and the increased use of military force.Iran continued to escalate the conflict. As from 19 September 1980 it intensified its heavy artillery fire and air attacks on heavily populated residential complexes and vital economic installations in Iraq as well as on Iraqi and foreign merchant shipping entering and leaving. Furthermore  the Iranian authorities announced the closure of the Strait of Hormuz to Iraqi navigation and declared a general mobilization  while amassing military forces in huge numbers along the borders and embarking upon a large-scale military operation openly using regular forces.Effective from 18 September 1980 the Iranian armed forces issued four military communiqués on their activities. In the third communiqué  issued on 19 September 1980  Iran stated that it used its air force in its military operations  in the fourth communiqué  issued on 19 September 1980  the Iranian authorities boasted that the fields of Naftkhaneh  an important Iraqi oil area  had been set on fire·The military operations undertaken by Iraq with effect from 7 September 1980 to expel the Iranian forces which were occupying its territory and shelling its border cities from that selfsame occupied Iraqi territory  as well as the military operations undertaken on 22 September 1980 to face the Iranian troops amassed on Iraqi borders with the object of effecting a deep incursion into Iraqi territory order to attain their aggressive and expansionist objectives against Iraq  were < purely defensive in character· In September 1980 Iraq had two options and no other: either to submit to the Iranian aggression aimed at the occupation of Ir. and its conversion into an Iranian province or to exercise legitimate self-defend. All of these attitudes adopted and actions taken by Iran had happened before 22 September 1980 and constitute a flagrant violation of a number of principles rules of international law governing friendly relations among States as codified the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States  which the General Assembly approved by consensus its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970  chief among which are the principle; of good-neighbourly relations  the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of States  the principle of sovereign equality of States and the principle that States shall fulfil their international obligation in good faith. Moreover  the net result of the actions of the Iranian Government - which was the first to use military force against Iraq  with effect from 4 September 1980  and even before that date - fall within the concept of direct armed aggression as laid down by the definition of aggression which the General Assembly approved by consensus in its resolution 3314 (XXIX)  of 14 December 1974 On the other hand  the measures taken by the Iraqi Government since 4 September 1980 to counter the Iranian aggression are consistent with the right of legitimate self-defence because they meet the conditions of necessity and reasonableness established by international law for the legitimate exercise of this right. Iran  whose President spoke before the Assembly a few days ago  wants the Assembly and the Security Council to forget all these acts of aggression and actions contrary to international law and the nature of relations between States In modern times  and to believe instead its allegation that Iraq committed aggression against it.Iran claims that Iraq has not resorted to political means to resolve the conflict and that it has waged war against Iran with a view to overthrowing the Iranian regime· Let us ask ourselves this· Did not all the efforts made by Iraq from February 1979 to September 1980  the latest of which being our memorandum of 11 September 1980  constitute political and diplomatic processes for resolving problems? Is it not Iraq that welcomed the establishment of a Republic in Iran  invited its Prime Minister to visit Iraq  sent congratulatory messages to its leadership and dispatched 293 notifications in diplomatic memorandums cautioning Iran against threats to Iraq's sovereignty and security? Is it not Iran that has heaped abuse on Iraq  threatened its security and stability insistently sought to change its political and social system  considered Khomeini to be Iraq’s guardian  used military force to violate Iraq's borders and threatened to invade its capital and erase it from the map of the region?Which of the two parties has rejected dialogue and the mediation of friends to resolve the problems between the two countries? In a speech he made in April 1980 Iran's then President  Bani-Sadr  boasted to his audience that President Saddam Hussein had on three occasions sought to send mediators to resolve the problems with Iran and that he  Bani-Sadr  had refused to talk to them. Any fair-minded person must ask himself this: was Iraq alone in being unable to resolve its problems with Iran by diplomatic means at that time  or was the entire world at a loss as to how to deal with that anomalous  aggressor regime  which has no respect for international law or established custom in State relations  and is thus unable to this day to resolve its problems with that regime?Let us go back to 1979 and 1980 and go over the daily events one by one  and ask the States of the region and those other States that have had problems with Iran which of them has been able to establish a constructive dialogue with the Iranian regime on the basis of international law  the rules of international conduct and mutual respect for sovereignty and interests. Has Kuwait  or Saudi Arabia  or Bahrain  or the Soviet Union  or the United States  or Prance or Britain? Which State  big or small  whether near Iran  far away from Iran or neighbouring Iran  was able at that time  or is able even today  to resolve its problems with Iran through dialogue  on the basis of international law and the rules of conduct in today's world? There are 1 001 proofs that the whole world has suffered and continues to suffer from deliberate Iranian violations of international law and agreements and breaches of contracts signed between Iran and the countries of the world  as well as from Iranian terrorist plots  Iranian audacities and Iranian rejection of dialogue. Perhaps former Secretary- General Waldheim' s notes on his visit to Tehran provide the best proof of what we have stated and of the way the Iranians have conducted their talks even with the representatives of our international Organization.The world has witnessed many conflicts  which had their origin in various causes  and it continues to witness many such conflicts. What should a Member State of the United Nations do when an armed conflict arises between it and another State? In this world to which we all belong there is an international authority concerned with security and stability in the world. That authority is the Security Council  On 28 September 1980  having met and considered the situation between Iraq and Iran  the Security Council adopted resolution 479 (1980)  which called for the cessation of hostilities and the initiation of negotiations. Iraq  a responsible Member of the United Nations  which believes In the United Nations Charter and in the laws and rules governing relations among States  accepted that resolution immediately  Iran  however  which has refused to resolve the problems with Iraq by political means  through negotiations  and which believes In using means that contravene international law and custom with a view to threatening the sovereignty and security of Iraq  refused to accept Security Council resolution 479 (1980) and. Instead  has Insisted on continuing the war to this day.Just as it refused to abide by the will of the International community and end the war in September 1980. So Iran has refused to resolve the conflict through other international organizations and bodies  such as the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement  by seeking  as in the case of the United Nations  to impose conditions which are contrary to international law and to the concepts of the age  with a view to enabling Iran to attain all its expansionist aims based on the theory of exporting the revolution  which is the root cause of all the problems plaguing the region today.Today we have a huge dossier of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and of the decisions and appeals of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  all of which call for the settlement of the conflict between Iran and Iraq by peaceful means on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations  international law  the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Islamic principles. Iran has rejected all these calls  while Iraq has accepted them all. If a country had truly been the victim of aggression  could it have rejected all those International efforts over a period of seven years and all those international appeals and calls. Insisting all the time on war  slaughter and destruction? Is not this attitude  rather  one characteristic of a covetous aggressor harbouring aggressive  expansionist designs? Which of the two parties to the conflict has considered the war a gift of God and a suitable occasion for liquidating internal opponents  allowing the revolution to strike root and getting rid of the older generation and a newer one? The declarations of Khomeini and all Iranian officials made since September 1980 until today have sung the praises of war and recounted its virtues and implications for the survival of the regime and the regime's ability to crush its opponents. Those declarations have also extolled the war's implications for the growth of Iran's Influence in the region and at the International level. Could war be an imposed situation on a regime that glorifies war in that manner? Or  rather  is it not that that regime Itself wanted this war and imposed it on Iraq and on the countries of the region  thus involving the international community as a whole in its effects? Who other than the aggressor Iran - which insists on exporting its backward revolution with its heinous crimes  which insists on bringing the countries of the region under its control and which Insists on resorting to terrorist means In all countries of the world - bears the responsibility for this war and for the slaughter and destruction which have been going on for more than seven years?The statements made by the leadership of the Iranian regime seven years ago and the statements they hysterically keep repeating today are enough to enable us to determine the side which has Initiated aggression and war and which is unable to survive without war  to say nothing of its responsibility for the continuation of the war  despite all the well-intentioned efforts that were made and continue to be made to end it. By concentrating on a three-week period of conflict between two neighbouring countries  after which the Security Council intervened  Iran tries  through lies  to present a topsy-turvy view of things. It wants us to forget all the acts of aggression and subversion and all the violations of international law which it committed against Iraq and all the countries of the region before  during and after that period. It wants the world to forget the death  slaughter and destruction which has continued for seven years because of its insistence on war  its refusal to abide by international law and its rejection of the jurisdiction of the international organization over the conflict  as well as its insistence on its own methods and concepts to resolve this conflict by force  terrorism and blackmail.I have called to mind what happened in 1979 and 1980 before the outbreak of the conflict between Iraq and Iran and I have cited the aggressive acts of Iran against my country and its threats to the sovereignty and security of Iraq. You  Mr. President  together with all the Members of the international Organization  know what is going on in the region now and what Iran does and says against the other States. You no doubt have heard of the missiles which Iran has launched against a small  peaceful country like Kuwait  and you know of the continuous threats to Kuwaiti shipping. You know of the impudent threats Iran has directed against Saudi Arabia and of its aggression against Saudi vessels and airspace  as well as of Iran's calls to overthrow the Saudi Arabian regime. You know the facts of Iranian efforts to intervene in the internal affairs of all the countries of the region  without exception. You also know that there is in Iran an alternate Government for many of the legitimate regimes in our region. You know of Iran's role in terrorism in Arab States of North Africa  which have been obliged to close Iranian embassies to avoid subversive and seditious acts carried out and financed by those embassies. You certainly also know of the facts of the acts of terrorism committed by Iranian agents even in non-Islamic States  such as in European countries. You know of the hostage game used by the Iranian regime as a means of political blackmail and the acquisition of arms to enable it to continue war and aggression against my country and others in the region.All these acts of aggression which are being committed by Iran against the countries of the region nine years after the establishment of its anomalous regime fall within the meaning of armed aggression under the definition of aggression approved by the General Assembly  to which I have already referred. If Iraq has borne more Iranian aggression than the other countries of the region it is only because there are 1 180 kilometres of common boundaries between Iraq and Iran and because our cities are only a few kilometres from those borders and the capital of our country is only 120 kilometres away from them.This is the Iranian regime whose representatives come to this forum to shed crocodile tears before members so as to make members believe that they are the victims of aggression. No one  however  has asked the representatives of the Iranian regime about their definition of aggression. The Iranian regime conceives aggression in terms different from those accepted by the other States of the world. According to the Iranian regime  it is aggression for my country to defend Itself against Iran's attempts to invade my country. In the view of the rulers of Tehran  it Is aggression not to allow them to intervene in our internal affairs  and it Is also aggression not to allow them to violate the rules of International law and the rules of conduct among States whenever they desire to do so. Aggression  in the eyes of the rulers of Tehran  consists in not allowing them to Impose their hegemony on the countries of the region. That is the concept of aggression of the rulers in Tehran.The anomalous and criminal Iranian regime  which wallows In the bloodbaths it has triggered in its country  which has driven children over minefields  which has sent hundreds of thousands of human beings to their deaths by its insistence on war for more than seven years  which treats international law and the rules of conduct among States with contempt  which has slaughtered prisoners of war and subjected them to unspeakable atrocities  which has failed to build good relations with any other State of the world apart from opportunistic and business relations with a few countries  which poses a threat to international security and stability  which lays down mines in international waters in the Gulf and threatens free navigation and which commits crimes in the region and in many areas of the world - such a regime has no right to set out conditions to the international Organization. Anyone who wishes to satisfy that regime and bargains with it at the expense of the principles of international law and the rules for the settlement of disputes between States is not rendering any service to peace  justice and the supremacy of law in the world. Such a person could be either miscalculating or seeking cheap gains at the expense of respect for the Charter and international law and respect for this Organization  as well as at our expense  we  the peoples of the region  which are being subjected to Iranian aggression  terrorism and blackmail.I should like  therefore  to make it quite clear that Iraq  which has struggled and striven with courage and ability against the Iranian aggression  and which has protected its sovereignty  security and the life of its citizens against the barbaric waves of invasion waged by Iran year after year  has stood as an Invincible barrier to protect the region and the world from Iran's evil. Any sensible person can well imagine what great dangers would threaten the region and the world should that barrier  God forbid  give way. Iraq will never allow more concessions to that murderous monster with its insatiable appetite for aggression  expansion and blackmail. The Iranian regime has rejected the resolutions of the Security Council one after the other  from resolution 479 (1980)  adopted in September 1980  up to resolution 588 (1986)  adopted in October 1986. Each time it has attacked the Security Council  blackmailed it and said: ""I do not like this resolution. If you want me to accept a resolution from the Council  you should include in it such and such"".When we come to the Security Council to deal with the situation and discuss the question of adopting another resolution  we find certain parties behind the scenes in the Security Council saying: ""Well  let us include something of what Iran wants; perhaps this other resolution will be acceptable to it"". And the - second resolution includes what Iran wants. But Iran then rejects the second resolution  just as it rejected the first  stating that it has not been given enough. The attempt is repeated a third  fourth and fifth time. Iran rejects all these attempts and continues the war  the blackmail and the game of deception.We have witnessed such scenes on all the occasions on which the conflict has been discussed  and we have heard the repeated Iranian claims and demands. On all those occasions the Security Council has made concessions with the object of achieving peace. Peace  however  has not been achieved; the war has continued. After the adoption of each resolution of the Security Council  the Iranian regime has undertaken a new campaign to invade Iraq  to reinforce its political blackmail with a military act it has tried to Impose on the ground. If  God forbid  the Iranian regime had been successful in only one of those invasions  which we have opposed and foiled  that would have been enough for Iran to establish its hegemony over the entire Gulf area and to extend its power even further  thereby overturning all balances and confronting the world with a dangerous situation. Now there exists a binding resolution  adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter - resolution 598 (1987). It is the strongest resolution ever adopted concerning the conflict  and it is also among the strongest resolutions adopted by the Security Council in its history. It was adopted unanimously by the 15 members of the Security Council  and is unambiguously cleat j its meaning needs no interpretation. The first step in implementing it is the observance of a comprehensive cease-fire  with withdrawal to internationally-recognized borders; the second is the establishment of supervision over that process; the third is the release and repatriation of prisoners-of-war. Thus the various steps follow each other in sequence. This is what Security Council resolution 598 (1987) says  not the delegation of Iraq.Now we see the representatives of Iran attacking the Security Council  as they did seven years ago  and placing conditions on it. They have rejected this balanced resolution  and they want the Security Council to interpret its own resolutions in the manner they  the representatives of Iran  desire. They want the Council to read the resolution in Persian. What we call for is respect by the Security Council for its own resolution and its strong rejection of the attempts at blackmail and deception. This is not just an Iraqi demand; it is a demand in harmony with the resolution and its true meaning. We regret that some of those who voted for the resolution are acquiescing in the attempted acts of blackmail and deception by Iran although they participated in its formulation and voted for it.We hope that there will be an end to those attempts and that the text of the resolution  which was adopted unanimously by members of the Council  will be observed. We also call on the Council to move forward unhesitatingly  without succumbing to any kind of manoeuvre or blackmail  within the context of resolution 598 (198T)  namely# use of the means provided by the Charter for the purpose of establishing comprehensive and durable peace.I should like on this occasion to state again that we welcome resolution 598 (1987) and are prepared to co-operate with the Secretary-General and the Security Council to implement it faithfully and honestly and as it stands. We shall strongly reject any attempt to review the resolution or the arrangement of its provisions.Finally  I should like to point out that if one is searching for more evidence on the contempt of the Iranian regime for international law and its non-adherence to its obligations under the Charter  then the statement of the President of that regime  made on Tuesday last made from this rostrum  provides the best possible such evidence. It was full of insults and abusive language against the Security Council and its permanent and non-permanent members over more than seven years# numbering more than 40 Member States from all continents.The President of the Iranian regime  speaking from the rostrum of the United Nations  did not say that his country adheres to the Charter of the United Nations and international law. We delivered a lecture to the Assembly on the concepts of his regime and his concept of international relations. We did not commit himself to respect the rules of our age  developed over the 40 years that have passed since the establishment of the United Nations.That statement  full of falsifications and lies and contradicted by the daily actions of the Iranian regime over the last nine years  clears any remaining doubts to the true position of that aggressive and expansionist regime. The statement puts an end to all the utterances  which have no basis in reality  that have been made in certain circles concerning a probable change in Iran's position on the resolutions of this Organization and the will of the international community. The President of the Iranian regime in fact declared war on the international community and the system of international relations as we know it in this Hall  filled as it is  with the representatives of the peoples of the world. We has revealed all the cards which the Iranian regime  and those who keep it company  have tried to cover. It remains for the international community - and the Security Council in particular - to declare itself  to affirm its credibility and to maintain before the world respect for the Charter of the United Nations  the hope of all peoples  on which they rely to face aggression decisively and achieve a just peace."
"70",3383,"ISL",42,1987,"﻿I congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly and assure you of the support of the delegation of Iceland in carrying out the duties of that noble office.Two years ago  at the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  I had the honour of addressing this great Assembly. On that occasion I also had the pleasure of listening to many world leaders express their hopes for a world without wars and misery  for a world of peace and good living for all. I do not doubt the sincerity of those who express such hopes  but I ask myself why  then  have we failed.In those fine anniversary speeches several explanations are found. Certainly  much has been achieved through the United Nations  and not least through the efforts of the various specialized agencies dealing with specific world problems. On the other hand  it seems to be a rather widespread opinion that the General Assembly and the Security Council have too often failed  and certainly there is considerable evidence to support such an opinion.The General Assembly has grown  it seems  into a forum of heated debates  with accusations and counter-accusations  between nations which too often seem to belong to power blocs with predetermined views on most issues of importance. To many the General Assembly does not look like a world forum of statesmen seeking in earnest answers to the many problems from which humanity is suffering. But why bring this up at this moment  somebody may wonder. Two years ago we went through the exercise of reviewing the work of the United Nations throughout 40 years and suggesting ways of improvement. We have new gathered here for yet another session of the General Assembly. This is therefore the proper time to do as we promised the world two years ago and show at this session that we meant what we said. The Icelandic delegation to the General Assembly will act accordingly. We shall not take part in accusations and arguments between nations. We shall honour the sovereign right of every nation to govern its own affairs as long as that is within Internationally agreed rules and regulations and does not give others cause for grievance. We shall oppose those that do not honour the sovereignty of their neighbours and that start military conflicts and wars. We shall support reasonable measures to settle such differences.We congratulate the Central American countries on the peace agreement which they have reached and urge all nations to support and assist in the implementation of that treaty. We assume  of course  that the parties involved will restore human rights in the area without delay and thus show their sincere intentions to live up to the agreement.We also strongly support the Security Council's attempt to end the military conflict in the Middle East. I wish to suggest that  if this is not accepted by the countries in question it should be followed up by further international action  such as the imposition of a complete arms embargo. We shall support all realistic resolutions calling for the limitation and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons  a nuclear-test ban and the elimination of chemical weapons  with satisfactory means of verification.We strongly oppose apartheid and any and all suppression of human rights. We shall take part in an honest effort to improve the general quality of life. We shall therefore support all reasonable measures to prevent pollution and destruction of the environment  especially when such practices affect more than one nation or the whole world. In this respect I refer  as examples  to such practices as making the oceans of the world dumps for the most hazardous waste and destroying the ozone layer. No nation or industrial complex should be allowed to continue such practices  often purely for financial gain.The danger involved In the application of nuclear energy for power production can no longer be overlooked. With that fact in mind I suggest that the nuclear power industry should be required to accept mandatory safety standards and inspection as determined by an international body such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.Iceland strongly supports the conclusions of and proposals made by the Nordic Commission on Environment and Development and we trust that these will become the basis for world action.We shall honour the right of every nation to make proper use of resources within its boundaries without interference from others  but where much exploitation affects others we shall stress international consultation and scientific control. Furthermore  we believe that all living resources have the right to be conserved  although they can be utilized properly. We reject interference by a self-appointed police force  however powerful such a nation may be. People in glasshouses should not throw stones.I trust that I have made the position of the Icelandic delegation clear. Furthermore  I want to stress that we look to the United Nations with high expectations and respect. In spite of its shortcomings  we see this important Organization as humanity's greatest hope for survival. We believe that the United Nations should be strengthened and we are willing to take part in such an effort.Personally  I believe that a major source of our problems is to be found in the lack of confidence and trust. Therefore I suggest that we do everything in our power to ensure that people from all parts of the world are allowed to travel freely and get acquainted. I am certain that this would dispel many of the false ideas about others now so frequently held by so many. A year ago my country  Iceland was host to the leaders of the two most powerful nations in the world  who  we can assume  have the future of mankind in their hands. It was a pleasure to host that meeting and thus contribute a little to the crucial attempt now being made to reach agreement on the long overdue reduction of nuclear weapons.I want to pay a special tribute to the super-Powers for the results now made evident by the agreement just announced on the elimination of medium-range missiles. We trust that this will be followed by further and larger steps in the elimination of nuclear weapons.Iceland  which is one among a very few nations that does not have a military force  will always be available to assist in such an attempt to improve life on earth. I should like to see my country become a sanctuary for those who want to meet in peace and seek solutions to the many problems from which mankind is suffering. For that purpose I would welcome not only the leaders of the super-Powers but all members of the General Assembly to my country  Iceland. "
"71",3430,"ISR",42,1987,"﻿Permit me  Sir  to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly.I wish to take this opportunity to express our support for the relentless efforts of the emissary of peace and goodwill  the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.In a world grown cynical of the super-Powers increased arms competition and fearful of the technologies it has unleashed  the people of Israel appreciate the readiness of the United States and the Soviet Union to begin a process of nuclear disarmament. This is not just a technical accord. It is a political dictum: no longer can we find military answers to political problems. What is necessary are political answers to the military menace. The world remains divided. While on the global level the parties seem to edge slowly towards accommodation  on the regional level passion still endure.Today  threatening mines in international waterways are symbols not of the modernity of warfare but of its persistence. In our region  mines of extremism lurk just beneath the surface; they may explode when least expected.Thus  we support the attempt to introduce a durable cease-fire in the Persian Gulf. In the vicinity of the world's most significant source of oil  two flames send dark clouds that obscure the horizon: the flame of fundamentalism launched to overpower moderation  and the flame of belligerency  residue of the Arab-Israeli dispute  seemingly calm  yet hardly extinguished. Each flame may reinforce the other.Never before was the menace of extremism so perilous; never before were the moderate forces of the Middle East  on both aides  closer to an understanding than today.Both Arabs and Israelis can be at peace with themselves only if they reach peace with each other.Fundamentalism threatens moderation. Belligerency requires resources that can help contain extremism.Arabs are troubled by the thrust of fundamentalism as they struggle with an impossibly expensive arms race and the need to address the just expectations of a rapidly growing population. Israelis are troubled by a demography wrought by war and the need to sustain a defence posture of ""the few against the many"". That is the heavy toll of the region's flames. They can be further fuelled; they can also be put out. Our actions today can either unleash forces of yet untold destruction  or they can launch us on a course of a new promise. Israel is celebrating its fortieth anniversary; four decades studded by hostility and war. From the memories of the Holocaust we have had to build a new life  as tragic biographies merged into a history of hope. We have returned to the birthplace of our faith  to the cradle of our biblical values. The language of the Prophets now echoes with the joy of children in the mountains and valleys where it began. Deserts were turned into gardens  human talent into industries. No emergency has delayed the growth of the democratic spirit; no war has prevented the construction of a just society and a modern economy.The historical analogy is inspiring: For 40 years our people wandered in the desert before Moses brought them to the promised land. Today again  after 40 years in the wilderness of belligerency  we stand at the gates of a new promise to our children and to the children of our neighbours: to live in understanding despite the differences; to determine their own fate without interference by armed forces triggered by hate.Can we offer them a Middle East where the intellectual challenge is man's conquest of nature  free of man's conquest of man? In brief  can we bring peace?We remember the last words of Moses before he parted from his people at the gates of the promised land. We admitted his inability to provide them with adequate clothing and fresh bread  and he offered them the right of choice;""I have set before you life and death  blessing and cursing: therefore  choose life  that both thou and thy seed may live"". (Deuteronomy  30:19)I speak with a sense of urgency  as the coming few months may be crucial.During this brief period we may begin negotiations on one of the most important issues of our day  or miss the ark of hope. This brief period may produce the long-sought-after breakthrough or be absorbed by political paralysis. Confidence that was built carefully  almost tacitly  among several parties in the area may evaporate. A coalition for peace held together by fragile links may fall apart with uncertain likelihood of revival.Present crises - in the Persian Gulf or Lebanon - may take unexpected turns; disillusionment with the absence of progress may produce new coalitions of hostility. Thus  in the absence of a vibrant peace process  the political skies may become capricious again  bringing drought to a thirsty region.Against these prospects of uncertainty stands the unprecedented if vulnerable reality whereby relevant parties to the conflict see a way to begin negotiations. Indeed  two years ago both Arabs and Israelis announced from this podium support for the current initiative for peace. Moreover  since then further progress has been made.We have rekindled our peace with Egypt and intensified the dialogue with its leaders and its people. We have found President Mubarak to be a builder of a better life for his people and of bridges for comprehensive peace in the region.At the cedar groves of the mountains of Ifrane  we met courageous leadership; King Hassan of Morocco calling for peace  aloud  and clearly.Across the Jordan River  rich in history and poor in water  we hear the echo of the voice of King Hussein  an experienced leader who wishes  like us  to bring our peoples out of the darkness of old hostility into the new greenhouses of peace  security and development.In the West Bank and Gaza  we notice an unannounced change. Many Palestinians seem to have concluded that violence leads nowhere  that dialogue should not be postponed. There is a real readiness to negotiate in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to solve a problem that all of us need  and would like  to solve; the Palestinian problem. We have all matured politically with the repeated failure of attempts to produce peace plans for our region. We have realized that none can be acceptable as a pre-condition of negotiation  for it is the object of negotiation to produce solutions that are otherwise unattainable. Hence  over the past three years efforts have focused on the most promising plan; to begin negotiations without pre-planning their outcome.Five months ago those efforts crystallized and found expression in a document worked out with the support of American emissaries  whose tireless and creative efforts should be credited with much of what has been accomplished. That document reflected a meeting of minds  Arab and Jewish  on the basis of eight principles.First  the goal is peace and direct negotiations are the way to reach it. Second  an international conference is the door to direct negotiations. Once convened it should lead immediately to face-to-face bilateral negotiations. Third  the conference would not impose a settlement or veto agreements reached bilaterally. Fourth  those who would attend the conference must accept Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and renounce terrorism and violence. Fifth  negotiations would be aimed at solving the Palestinian problem in all its aspects. This would be done in negotiations between the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and the Israeli delegation. Sixth  negotiations would be conducted independently in three bilateral-geographic committees: a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and an Israeli delegation in one·  a Syrian and an Israeli delegation in another·  and a Lebanese and an Israeli delegation in the third. All delegations  as well as an Egyptian one  would be invited to participate in a fourth  multilateral  committee. Seventh  whereas the bilateral committees would be engaged in solving the conflicts of the past  the multilateral committee would deal with the charting of opportunities for the region's future. Eighth  the five permanent members of the Security Council would serve as the matchmakers  entrusted with bringing the parties together and legitimising the process whereby the parties would negotiate freely and directly  without uninvited - and occasionally divided - external involvement. This would not be a ceremonial role but an essential one in facilitating negotiations.Israel is United in its search for peace  in our desire to negotiate directly with our neighbours. We differ over how best to move the process forward. The idea of an international conference raises opposition in some Israeli quarters  while others see it as a real opening. The Israeli Cabinet is divided on the issue and has yet to make a decision. Much depends on the nature of the conference. Unless the permanent members of the Security Council respect the current consensus  rather than insisting on their old preferences  the international conference may remain just a slogan.We call upon the Soviet Union to credit us with the same good faith in our efforts towards peace as we credit it within its readiness to make glasnost a way of life. The Soviet Union is not our enemy. It must be aware of our historical and family attachment to our brethren living in its land. We appeal to the new leadership in Moscow to allow the Jewish people to express their identity freely and to reunite with their destiny in the land of their ancestors.We call upon the People's Republic of China  a great country that we respect  not to be timid or one-sided in its support for negotiations.To both Moscow and Beijing we say candidly that diplomatic relations are not the prize for peace but a channel for communication. Those wishing to participate in bringing peace cannot confine their relations to one side in the rivalry alone.I should like to address myself to the Palestinian people. The time for recrimination and blame is past. They have brought only violence and terror. Now is the time to turn from violence to dialogue and to travel jointly towards a different destiny. There  your children  like ours  will live in self-respect  exercise self-expression and enjoy freedom and peace. We  who have experienced domination by others  do not wish to dominate others. We  who sought justice and security  do not wish to deny them to others.For the past 40 years our ancient region has become - not by choice - a testing ground for the technology of war. Thousands of human lives  Arab and Jewish  have been tragically lost and billions of dollars have been spent to no avail.We are unable to change the past but we can design a future in which our region will be able to develop into a testing ground for mobilizing science and technology  to offer a new source of growth; a future in which peace attracts economic investment; a future in which resources saved by restraining the arms race are invested in basic and higher education.It is this vision of an alternative future that has given birth to the suggestion that in the wake of the opening of political negotiations an economic conference  without political strings attached  should take place. Such a conference  composed of those having a stake in regional stability and the capacity to contribute to it  could offer a most Imaginative plan for regional development.To those who preach indecision  to those who take shelter in the illusion of a tranquil status quo  we say: this is our moment of choice; decisions of today will determine the fate of our people for decades to come. Our choice is between hatred and dialogue  suspicion and hope. Our choice is between investment in an arms race and investment in the well-being of our people  of our children. Our choice is between extremism and moderation  between fundamentalism and reason. It is our choice to prevent the next war.It is up to us to make the months to come a time for reason.I welcome the forthcoming visit of Secretary Shultz to our region as an opportunity to negotiate on the remaining obstacles. I am convinced that there are no conflicts for which there is no hope for solution  only people who have best hope in their search for solutions. I am convinced that the real conflict in the Middle East today is not between Jew and Moslem·  Arab and Israeli; Palestinian and Zionist. The conflict is between ""past-oriented"" leadership and ""future-oriented"" leadership; between those resigned to the fatalism of belligerency and those determined to alter this fate. For the future of our children  for a better tomorrow  we must all stand up to the preachers of war.To the advocates of destruction  United we have to say there are no holy wars  only holy human lives.On the very first day of our independence I learned from my mentor  David Ben-Gurion  who said this time and again  that peace is the highest degree of security·  and that the moral call is the highest degree of wisdom. I shall remember it forever."
"72",3477,"ITA",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  I should like first of all to convey to you the congratulations of the Italian Government on your election. You represent a country which  because of its geographic position  strategic significance and economic weight  is called upon to provide  within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  a major contribution to the existing delicate balances on the European continent. Your personal skill and experience are important guarantees for the Success of our work. I should also like to convey my appreciation to the outgoing President. We carried out his functions at a particularly difficult time for the United Nations and succeeded in ensuring results in the work of the General Assembly to the general satisfaction of all. We deserves our gratitude for his endeavours and our appreciation for his accomplishments.Finally  I should like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the considerable efforts he has undertaken - for which we should all be grateful - to put an end to the Iran-Iraq conflict  which represents one of the longest and most destructive tragedies of modern history.The opening of the forty-second session of the General Assembly took place at almost the same time as the announcement of a virtually concluded agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States on the total elimination of intermediate and short-range missiles. For the first time in the history of humanity  massive quantities of armaments - enough to devastate the entire European continent - will be destroyed as a result of negotiations rather than of war. The significance of the agreement in principle to conclude a treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces  however  does not just lie in arms reductions - in its thinning of the forest of missiles that threatens Europe. Its real significance  in my view  lies in the process it will set in motion as well as in the search for new concepts of security which will no longer be based only on the accumulation of arms and which will put an end to the present state of instability  where peace is impossible and war is improbable. It is thus fitting that the United States and the Soviet Union consider this agreement to be an historic event. I would add that this agreement constitutes a turning-point  more because of its future potential than because of what it can achieve in the short term.We must therefore unreservedly praise those men of good will who were the architects of this major achievement for the tenacity they have shown in the search for a middle ground between two concepts of the world and two very different political programmes.President Reagan  in close consultation with his allies  worked long and hard to translate into deed his long-declared intention to create a world in which the role of nuclear arms would gradually be reduced.General-Secretary Gorbachev  for his part  deserves our appreciation for the vitality and openness he has imparted to the foreign policy of the Soviet Union. We has shown considerable courage in recognizing that there is not necessarily a relationship between the historic ambitions of his country and the steady accumulation of offensive weapons. Italy has always worked to encourage the policy of dialogue. My country was the first nation to hail unhesitatingly the achievements resulting from the Reykjavik meeting. We did so because we were convinced that the approach adopted on that occasion was the correct one. Dialogue must be based on strongly held convictions but it must also be marked by the humility needed to renounce intolerance and by trust in the other party's understanding and good faith.No other lesson could be more timely in an era when mistrust is often the main stumbling-block. Let us not forget that in international politics there are # opportunities that might not recur and that history is made by seizing such moments. For the first time  the United States and the Soviet Union seem ready to heed the concern expressed by John Fitzgerald Kennedy when he pointed out that if humanity did not put an end to war  war would put an end to humanity.The meetings that took place in Washington last week are likely to promote the development of the entire spectrum of East-West relations. They will facilitate the establishment of a network of reciprocal interests that will enable the international community more effectively to contain and resolve its crises.We should  of course  refrain from harbouring illusions. We must not think that overt or latent rivalries will disappear  that suspicion regarding the intentions of the other side will suddenly be replaced by complete trust. However  we can expect greater convergence in the search for stability. That is why the importance of the understanding reached by the United States and the Soviet Onion transcends Fast-West relations - it heralds a model of behaviour and collaboration based not on the search for unilateral advantage but  rather  on the conviction that a disadvantage for one party is not necessarily an advantage for the other.This convergence can also be seen in the manner in which the great Powers have confronted the crisis that most concerns us today - the Iran-Iraq conflict - and in the unanimity shown by the Security Council in adopting resolution 598 (1987). The war between Iran and Iran is a very complex phenomenon  whose implications can only he perceived with difficulty since it is a war with both religious and political aspects  it has the potential to alter the balances in the region and to make its consequences felt throughout the Middle East  even transforming the area into a Lebanon of enormous dimensions.It is for this reason that we value highly the peace effort undertaken by the United States and the Soviet Union  Here  again  a convergence has been achieved between the two countries - this time through the exercise of joint responsibility  the framework for which has been provided by United Nations machinery. It will be necessary to bear this in mind at all times in the course of a peace progress that is likely to be difficult. No effort should be spared in safeguarding the process launched by Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and in inducing the interested parties fully and rapidly to implement its provisions Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuellar's mission to Teheran and Baghdad resulted in the gathering of elements capable of providing a basis for future action. I wish to assure the Assembly that Italy  as a member of the Security Council  where it will assume the presidency for the month of October  will do everything possible to ensure that the Secretary-General may be able successfully to implement the mandate entrusted to him.I sincerely hope that the intransigence of the two parties and the difficulties in overcoming ill will  hatred and aggravated nationalism will not prevent us from harvesting the fruits of the determined efforts of the Secretary-General and of the wider participation of the international community in this effort to restore normal conditions to the area.In my view  the search for peace in the region between Iran and Iraq revolves around the relationship between a cease-fire and the restoration of normal conditions at the borders between the two countries  on the one hand  and the determination of the responsibility for initiation of the conflict  on the other hand. The problem is difficult but not insoluble  and it is necessary to continue to do everything possible to bring the belligerent parties to Join in the peace process laid down in Security Council resolution 598 (1987).Finally  in the event that the efforts of the Secretary-General and our support were to prove unproductive  new measures would become necessary. The very threat of such measures  even before they become a coercive instrument  should constitute a matter for reflection for the nations involved in the conflict.The determination of responsibilities is certainly a complex problem. I believe  however  that it should be possible to distinguish at least two phases in the process which  in conformity with Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  should lead to this result. The first phase would be the determination of the party that initiated hostilities. A second phase would be the determination of the underlying and immediate causes at the origin of the conflict  which  in any event  must be removed in order to strengthen the peace process and render it definitive.The decision taken by my Government to send naval units to the Gulf to offer protection to the merchant ships flying the Italian flag does not represent a deviation from this policy  which has as its principal objective the end of this conflict and therefore also the protection of the freedom of navigation in international waters. Our action has the limited goal of protecting well-defined Italian interests with no hostile intentions towards any countries of the area. We have all had bitter experiences with the ability of regional crises to turn into global conflicts. Such experiences should strengthen our common resolve to support the action of the United Nations and its capacity to prevent destabilizing developments in the various regions of the world.We are aware of what abandonment of the principles and instruments of multilateralism meant in terms of destruction and violence in the history of the European continent. For that reason  we strongly believe in the United Nations often unique capacities for action and intervention. The Organization is all the more indispensable in that peace and stability are challenged by groups that are expressions of North-South and East-West rivalries and inspired by divergent ideologies  strategic requirements and economic interests.It was the very awareness that regional crises can unleash global conflicts that strengthened the determination of the Western European countries to unite  together with the countries on the other side of the Atlantic  in a defensive alliance and to initiate among themselves a process of political and economic integration.The history of the 40 years since the end of the Second world War demonstrates how such regional agreements have uniquely contributed to creating  on the one hand  security conditions not otherwise attainable and  on the other  the premises for the development of East-West relations.The search for dialogue and solidarity on regional bases  which corresponds with one of the principles of the United Nations Charter  is making headway in other regions of the world  owing in large part to the example and impetus provided by Europe. We see the movement progressing today  despite great difficulties and widespread inertia  in a region such as Latin America  whose destiny Europeans had for too long considered to be confinement in - to use the expression of Gabriel Garcia Marauez - its ""hundred years of solitude"". But the recently signed Guatemala City agreement provides an example of vitality and creativity  it is a victory for reason that deserves the support of the community of nations  which it needs in order decisively to assert itself. Then there are other conflicts  such as the Arab-Israeli conflict  over which a veil of silence seems to have descended  particularly of late. However  problems are not solved by ignoring them. It is necessary to confront them openly and in a timely manner. It is also necessary to avoid giving the impression that they become matters of concern only when they reach a stage where they directly endanger our own interests.I am aware that the path towards an international conference on the Middle East is still long  strewn with obstacles and rendered uncertain by numerous elements yet to be defined. However  I wish strongly to reiterate that it is necessary to overcome paralysing doubts and to avoid turning the Middle East into t yet another forgotten and hopeless conflict  as was until recently the case with the Gulf war. It is necessary to defuse this process that fuels violence and     frustration  because it would be illusory to think that its consequences could be confined to purely local dimensions.The problems of peace that we face are immense. In addition to those I have j. mentioned there remain other unacceptable situations of regional tension; situations dealt with extensively in the statement made yesterday by the current "" President of the European Community on behalf of its 12 member States. I do not  therefore  believe it is necessary for me to comment further on those crises. I would only note that one sometimes has the impression that our Governments and the international organizations  including the United Nations  are unable to work out viable solutions to the problems before them.This consideration should not be construed as criticism of the actions of the United Nations or of individual countries. General conviction that  inevitably  not only our State institutions but our societies as a whole  particularly those sectors with the greatest knowledge of the instruments needed to confront current difficulties  must become involved in the search for peace.Here I am thinking of the world of science  which we should like to be more open and not divided by ideological barriers  a vehicle for common progress rather than just an arena for competition. The idea of joint nuclear tests raised in the contacts between the two major Powers would be in keeping with that goal.At the meeting held at Erice  Sicily  this summer  Edward Teller recalled the extent to which great discoveries of physics were subjected to secrecy as a consequence first of the Second World War and then of the cold-war climate. That famous scientist warned that in the future it would be necessary to prevent the cloak of secrecy again descending on scientific discoveries.Science can respond to all the challenges that are hound to carry increasing weight in the approaching third millennium of our era. It can do so by spreading an awareness that in our time fundamental balances can be achieved by involving science and those who have mastered it. Here I am thinking of meteorological and seismic phenomena and climatic variations  and endeavours such as the protection of the environment and the war against hunger and disease  which can be included in the framework of the larger effort to keep our planet under control.Of the evils that afflict our daily lives but can be combated only on a global scale - that is  through the United Nations - the drug problem is  next to terrorism  certainly one of the most alarming. In some countries more than half of all crimes are linked to the use of drugs. Drugs are connected with the Illegal arms traffic  with terrorism and with subversion. According to some calculations global profits from the drug traffic are equivalent to the gross national product of my country. That is one of the reasons the Italian Government has become the main supporter of the United Nations specialized agency entrusted with the struggle against this silent and clandestine scourge that saps the roots of our societies. We also welcomed with great satisfaction the results of the conference held last June at Vienna.The bloody conflict between Iran and Iraq has once again drawn the world's attention to the problem of the transfer of conventional weapons and of their reduction.Exactly 10 years ago the United States President  Jimmy Carter  drew the General Assembly's attention to the fact that the rate of growth of military spending was increasing at a faster rate in the developing countries than in the more advanced countries  at a time when the cost of equipping a single soldier was 60 times greater than the cost of a child's education. Ten years later this situation has certainly not changed for the better. Indeed  there are countries where it can be said that weapons kill ever before they are used  since they drain resources from economies already on the edge of subsistence. Aware of this situation  Italy proposed as long ago as 1977 that the possibility be considered of establishing within the framework of the United Nations appropriate machinery to place the conventional arms trade under control. We think that it would be possible to go even further and agree on a code of conduct in this area. In my view  recent developments make our previous proposals particularly timely and we might well put them forward again.It is increasingly evident  as was noted recently at the summit meeting in Venice of the seven most industrialized nations  that peace and prosperity can be pursued only on a global scale. Interdependence makes it necessary not only to ensure co-ordination of the stronger economies but also to follow with close attention the economic development of developing countries.The struggle against underdevelopment is a means of relieving human misery and especially of fighting the terrible scourge of hunger. Solidarity with those who bear a/burden so much greater than ours is also a means of establishing new relationships in a world which increasingly requires the co-operation of all  a world which is constantly becoming smaller  in which no one can remain a spectator of the misfortunes of others  in which on the contrary all must consider themselves members of the same team.This solidarity must also permeate the international economy  although I am well aware that the idea of a single world with common problems and of the interdependence of the regions of the earth gives rise to many objections  to selfishness and to the compromises of the policies of the day. In fact  only with a sense of solidarity will we be able to make steady progress and belie catastrophic visions and predictions.It is the responsibility of all countries  but above all the industrialized ones  to overcome existing economic imbalances. The international community  through its various mechanisms  is trying to resolve the serious challenges within the North-South framework  such as the grave situation of indebtedness of many developing countries  the recurring food crises and the difficulties of access to the markets of the industrialized economies.The economist Arthur Lewis could write in the 1960s that the combined economies of Africa  Asia and Latin America amounted to less than 0.5 per cent of the gross national product of the industrialized countries. The numerous ties that we maintain with the economies of those regions through international trade and because of their external debt show the extent to which such an assessment would no longer be valid today.Italy's resources are inevitably limited  but my country is nevertheless determined to make a special contribution to the solution of these problems by intensifying its programmes of development assistance through increasingly effective and diversified instruments of intervention. The massive integration of our programmes of bilateral assistance in the activities of the United Nations in the form of either financial contributions or participation in the Organization's projects is an element of this action which lends greater coherence to our foreign policy as a whole.The difficulties that we will meet should not lead us to indulge in pessimism and inaction because  as I have already said  the most recent evolution of the international political situation requires of us an even greater commitment to the well-being of developing countries. It is a commitment that is in our own interest. Abraham Lincoln said of his country on the eve of its most testing experience that America could not live ""half slave and half free"". I conclude with that quotation  which applies today to our entire planet. "
"73",3523,"JAM",42,1987,"﻿Twenty-five years ago  following the attainment of its independence  Jamaica's first policy statement was made at the seventeenth session of the United Nations General Assembly  under the presidency of an illustrious citizens of Pakistan  Sir Zafrulla Khan  from the Group of Asian Countries. Today the presidency is in the able hands of a most distinguished representative of the German Democratic Republic. This is indeed testimony to the important contribution which the varying political  economic and cultural systems can bring to the global search for peace  development and stability.My delegation congratulates you  Mr. President  and all the other officers on your election to the leadership of this Assembly. We anticipate that under your guidance there will be marked progress in the search for effective  durable solutions to some of the issues which confront us. The forty-first session of the General Assembly benefited from the expert leadership of Foreign Minister Choudhury of Bangladesh. We cannot overstate the value of his contribution to the achievements of that session and we commend him for it.When we look at the statement we made at this rostrum 25 years ago we see that much the same issues remain. Of course  it would be too much to expect that within this arbitrary 25-year period  this quarter-century  human nature would have been so altered as to make conflicts and wars and social and economic problems disappear. In fact situations which demonstrate the persistence in the international community of a lack of respect for the principles of the Charter concerning the peaceful resolution of conflicts  non-aggression and the non-use of force or the threat of force continue to abound. Nevertheless there have been improvements. The world has also experienced vast political  economic  scientific and technological changes  some of which today challenge man to cope adequately with the accelerating pace of the convulsions surrounding him.Today we contemplate a General Assembly agenda which is much larger than the one we looked at 25 years ago. Some of the items are new  but all concern the persistent effort to use this Organization and the forum it affords to deal with living on this planet. Whether defined in political  economic  social  cultural or technological terms  they are all fundamentally related to the basic question: how do we cope or how are we coping?Today  after 2 5 years  the United Nations can proudly point to its record on decolonisation. Since 1962  when Jamaica and five other countries took their seats as States Members of this Organization  4 9 others have broken the shackles of colonialism. This is a great achievement) yet we still have a little way to go. South Africa's continued defiance with respect to the independence of Namibia is a major blot on the record. South Africa has maintained its oppressive rule over Namibia the better to facilitate its plundering of Namibia's resources  in defiance of the international community. South Africa's policies are as unconscionable today as they ever were. Yet the failure to deal with them rests squarely on those countries whose policies have prevented the implementation of the enforcement measures possible under Chapter VII of the Charter.Jamaica reiterates its call for Security Council action under Chapter VII to ensure the implementation of resolution 435 (1978).We reaffirm our total rejection of the concept of linkage and restate our firm belief in the legitimacy of the struggle of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)   the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people. In 1962 Jamaica proposed to the General Assembly that an international year for human rights be declared. This was observed by the international community in 1968. Since 1962 much work has been undertaken in the United Nations system  resulting in the adoption and entry into force of several very important conventions for the promotion and protection of human rights. My delegation notes with satisfaction the work of the several committees established under the various human rights instruments and of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Nevertheless  flagrant violations of human rights continue in many regions of the world.How can the world continue to tolerate the vicious system of apartheid - a gross example of human rights denied? For our 25 years as an independent country despite several changes of Government  our people have supported the Government's stance against the apartheid system. During those years we have seen the inhuman situation which is the result of this abhorrent system grow steadily worse as it claims the lives of thousands of innocent victims  including children; as it allows thousands  including children  to languish in jail without trial·  as it leaves further countless thousands  including children  both physically and emotionally maimed as it denies 2 5 million persons who constitute the black population some of their most fundamental human rights - thus seeking to impose on the majority population a kind of modern-day serfdom for which Pretoria's only justification is the colour of a person's skin.We have seen the growing resentment and anger of an oppressed population. We have watched with deep concern as the situation has developed with a frightening inevitability to the point of explosion. We have seen the way in which this racist regime wilfully and cynically manipulates all efforts to negotiate a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. And we have watched with dismay as the international community has unanimously condemned the apartheid system but nevertheless has failed to agree on measures to bring that system to an end. But we have also seen the influence which economic pressure has on that regime and we maintain and remain convinced that the implementation of comprehensive mandatory sanctions is the only option for a peaceful solution of this intolerable situation. Strong and concerted international action against apartheid must match the international condemnation which is so freely expressed. The front-line States against which Pretoria has committed acts of aggression and sabotage must be able to rely on the effective solidarity of the international community as they seek to eliminate the dependence on their economic linkage with South Africa and improve their capacity to defend themselves against Pretoria's continuing aggression. The situation in Mozambique and Angola cries out for concerted international attention. Will this be just another General Assembly from which only strong anti-apartheid resolutions emerge?From time to time we ask ourselves what is the use of the United Nations? But we know that whatever its shortcomings that the past years have revealed it is an indispensable institution. Whether in the Middle East  where the central issue of the right of the Palestinian people remains unfulfilled and the right of Israel to a peaceful existence within safe and secure borders must be assured  or in Kampuchea  or Afghanistan where we call for the withdrawal of foreign forces to enable the peoples to exercise fully their right to self-determination  the United Nations must have an increasing role to play. Jamaica continues to support an international conference under United Nations auspices to design a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. The same is true of Kampuchea. In Afghanistan the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General and his representatives must continue to be supported by all.In the Gulf Jamaica believes that the United Nations has an important role to play in the achievement of a peaceful solution. We support Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General to fashion a settlement in the area. Jamaica is of the view that a cessation of the war between Iran and Iraq is a vital pre-condition for stability in the region and for peaceful passage of maritime traffic. It is therefore essential that both Iran and Iraq comply with the demands of the international community for a speedy solution to their conflict. We are encouraged to hope that violation of the territorial integrity of Chad will be put to an end soon now that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has again become very actively involved.In our region  the conflict of Central America did not exist in its present form 25 years ago. But the seeds were there. The longstanding social and economic disparities have given rise to conflicts into which  more recently  ideological differences have intruded. We have followed closely and have supported diplomatic initiatives to bring about a negotiated settlement acceptable to all the parties involved in that regional conflict. Time and time again our expectations have been dashed as an effective solution eluded these efforts. We were  however  encouraged by the Agreement signed on 7 August in Guatemala by the five Central American Presidents as a demonstration of their determination to resolve their differences through dialogue.The Government of Jamaica wishes to commend the longstanding and painstaking efforts of the Contadora and Support Group and their contribution to this latest development  and also the role of President Arias of Costa Rica  whose proposal formed the basis for the Agreement. It is our hope that the parties to the Agreement will respect those commitments and that implementation will follow the agreed schedule. We urge the international community to support this endeavour to generate peace  stability and development in the region. In particular  we would urge all those States external to Central America and which have interests in the region  to support fully this noble endeavour and thus allow the Central American States to resolve their conflict without external intervention.Whatever the regional conflict may be or wherever it is  one major issue overhangs us all  and that is the threat of nuclear war and the persisting race between the super-Powers to acquire more sophisticated nuclear weapons systems. The United Nations has been strenuous in its efforts to put a stop to this madness. In 1962 Jamaica expressed its concern at the escalation of the arms race. Today  25 years later  the situation is infinitely more dangerous. We continue to urge and support the adoption of measures for the achievement of general and complete disarmament. We expressed our optimism at the news of the agreement between the two super-Powers to eliminate one entire class of nuclear weapons. This is a major event for the international community. But we should not be euphoric. There are still enough nuclear weapons to destroy civilization several times over. Hence  we must persist in maintaining the pressure on the nuclear Powers·. At the same time  the race for the accumulation of conventional armaments must not become a substitute for the race in nuclear weapons.A few weeks ago the Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development ended. We deeply regret that all States did not participate  but we believe that the message which emanated from the Conference will find a ready  positive response among peoples of the East and West  of the North and South.The paradox of millions of dollars spent in weapons of mass destruction  in order to maintain peace and security  while millions of people remain in abject poverty and deprivation  cannot continue. We have had occasion to refer to new kinds of problems with serious international impact  among which were international terrorism  illicit trafficking in drugs and the debt crisis.Jamaica condemns international terrorism whether it be state-perpetrated or from any other source. We are concerned and appalled by its random and destructive mature; by its ability to weave a web of fear  hostility and distrust among nations and peoples  thus gnawing away at the framework of peace  stability and good will which the United Nations has so painstakingly sought to develop. We are fully committed to the adoption of measures to eradicate international terrorism and will continue to support efforts to this end.The international community has recognized the need to close ranks in the fight against drug abuse and the illicit traffic in narcotics. Conferences at global  regional and sub regional levels have fostered action by the large majority of States to wipe this evil from the face of the earth. Not only are we concerned about the irreparable damage to our people that can result from drug abuse  but we are gravely troubled by the security implications  as the illicit traffic is inevitably linked with international crime  which respects no frontier. The multilateral plans of action which resulted from the various conferences  in particular  the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking which was held earlier this year  reflect our commitment as sovereign nations to co-operation in the relentless struggle against drug abuse and illicit trafficking in drugs. We believe the development of international law  through the adoption of a convention on this matter  could greatly enhance this international campaign.On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of our membership in the United Nations  my Government would have liked to be able to state unequivocally that considerable progress had been made in promoting the goals and principles of this Organization in economic development. Regrettably  we are unable to do so.The challenge of development is even more pressing than it was 25 years ago when the world economy was vibrant. Despite the significant advances made during the last two decades in living standards to which the United Nations system has made valuable contributions the developing countries have been facing unprecedented economic difficulties in the 1980s. These difficulties threaten the economic and social gains made by  and the stability  of our States. Developing countries are being encouraged to pursue export-led growth but  at the same time  the very industrialized countries which encourage this path to growth are seeking to erect protectionist barriers around their own uncompetitive domestic industries. This leads to a reduction in the level of exports from developing countries to developed country markets  to a fall in foreign exchange earnings  and therefore to a reduction in the capacity to import goods necessary to sustain our economies. The imbalances within the world economy are thus perpetuated.The new round of multilateral trade negotiations which was launched at Punta del Este  Uruguay  in September of last year  emerged in response to the overall continued deterioration in the international trading environment and the need to halt this trend by restoring international trade to agreed multilateral discipline. The contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  face new challenges as they negotiate a wide range of trade related issues during this round. Jamaica attaches much importance to these negotiations as we feel that agreed rules and principles  which seek to provide a stable  practical and secure international trading environment  not only help trade  but foster the climate for foreign investment.The burden of external debt has now become the greatest obstacle to economic development. The gap between average living standards in developing countries and those in the developed world has widened and there are growing disparities between different parts of the developing world. We believe that our creditors are now fully aware of the need for creative and positive action on their part with a view to alleviating the situation.The view that the external debt problems of developing countries would become manageable within a brief period is no longer realistic. The focus on short-term stabilization programmes supported by the International Monetary Fund and the rescheduling of bilateral obligations through the Paris Club and commercial debt directly with commercial banks have to be re-examined. New thinking must take into account the capacity to service the debt and the situation of small middle income countries with high debt service burdens and limited room for additional indebtedness. The resumption of a growth path must be a fundamental objective.The Prime Minister of Jamaica has put forward a proposal which  we submit  can assist in co-ordinating and improving approaches to the debt crisis. The proposal is for a new type of policy-based lending programme which directly addresses the need for both debt service and secure economic growth. This facility  to be offered by multilateral financial institutions  would be conditioned on the basis of a targeted reduction of debt service ratios to sustainable levels over a programme period  geared to release sufficient disposable resources to achieve targeted growth. As a parallel programme  the Paris Club and commercial banks would also condition their multi-year rescheduling to the targeted debt service ratios.We would welcome discussion on this proposal in the Second Committee  and we solicit the support of Members of the United Nations for what we are convinced is a useful and constructive initiative in the complex search for solutions. I am convinced that there is wide agreement that a solution to the debt problem will not only assist in improving the economies of developing countries  but will also form part of a broader solution of the problems which together contribute to the present stagnation of the world economy.The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII) which was recently held in Geneva  was eagerly awaited by the countries of the developing world. It presented an opportunity for the international community to seek concrete solutions to the many problems which beset the world economy. We looked to that forum for policies and measures which would revitalize development  growth and international trade and foster a more predictable and supportive environment.UNCTAD VII was not the resounding success for which we had all hoped. The decisive action that the current world economic situation required was not forthcoming. However  it was an important advance in multilateralism and interdependence. It was a renewed commitment to UNCTAD. The international community recognized that the four-yearly UNCTAD conferences continue to provide an opportunity for frank and useful discussions of development issues. The final act of UNCTAD VII  that consensus document which brings together the assessment of world economic trends  policies and measures in the areas of resources for development  commodities  international trade and special measures for the least developed countries  will remain an important policy document for implementing reforms to the international economic and financial systems.Jamaica remains fully committed to multilateralism and will continue to play a positive role in the programmes and projects sponsored by the institutions of the United Nations. We expect that these programmes will complement those introduced at the national and regional levels. We believe that our efforts  coupled with those introduced and developed by the wider international community  will assist us in achieving our national goal of a better life for our people in a peaceful  secure and stable international environment.We note with great satisfaction that major progress has been made in the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority on the problem of overlapping claims. This good news should help to convince the remaining doubters about the viability of the regime that the members of the international community fashioned by consensus. We expect the meeting in December to be successful. It continues to be our hope that ratification of the Convention will move speedily along.Jamaica recognizes that the United Nations can be effective only to the extent to which we  the Member States  seek to make it so. There have been recent indications of a disposition to do that. We are encouraged by this. The United Nations is all of us. We all share the responsibility to use it to help make a better world."
"74",3569,"JOR",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  allow me to extend to you my delegation's sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I should also like to express our deep appreciation to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Huraayun Choudhury  for the skill with which he was able to guide the last session through a difficult period.May I also express our gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his commitment to the cause of peace and his tenacious efforts to promote it. Those efforts  supported by the Security Council  are particularly relevant to the region to which I belong. Despite setbacks  we continue to believe firmly that the United Nations and the Secretary-General remain a decisive factor in the process of peace-making and peace-keeping.Many people believe that nuclear deterrence has saved humanity from a world war during the last four decades. The so-called balance of terror may have played a role in military strategy  but it negates our common humanity and remains devoid of any ethical content. On the other hand  few realize that since the Second World War there have been more than 150 armed conflicts  in practically all parts of the world. These have claimed more than 2(J million lives since 1945 - most of them innocent victims of power games and man's inhumanity to man. Right now there are some 40 armed conflicts going on within or between States. The Eastern Mediterranean region  from which I come  has witnessed all three types of armed conflict which have through the ages blotted human history.The first type is characterized by internal tensions and armed violence. Lebanon is a tragic example of this. As compared to the First World War  when the ratio of civilian casualties was only 5 per cent  95 per cent of the lives claimed in the Lebanese conflict have been those of non-combatants - innocent men  women and children. We mourn them all the more because the tragedy of Lebanon is exacerbated by the perpetuation of the conflict by proxy. The continuing war and the partition of Lebanon only serve interests beyond its borders.The second type of armed conflict is that in which blood is shed when a State  in order to export its revolution  resorts to any means  even armed violence and war. The Iran-Iraq war is an example of this type of conflict. We deplore the use of religion to promote political ends. This war  which has already been ravaging two Muslim nations for more than seven years  is now spreading to the rest of the Gulf area. It represents a serious threat not only to the region but to global peace. Jordan has  without any reservation  supported Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which calls for the imposition of a cease-fire and the withdrawal of all forces to the internationally recognized boundaries  in order to bring an end to this senseless war. The war has already taken hundreds of thousands of lives  including those of children who have been used as soldiers. It must not be allowed to be internationalised by proxy. The super-Powers  which play a decisive role in the context of the Security Council  have a special responsibility which they must fully shoulder in order to bring about peace.The third type is the classic colonial form of armed conflict  where territory is occupied by force for purposes of exploitation and annexation. The Arab-Israeli conflict is a perfect example of that. In this respect  throughout the last two decades Israeli aggression in the occupied territories of the West Bank  the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights has continued unabated. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) provide adequate bases for establishing peace in the area. For its part  Jordan has spared no effort to promote the process of a comprehensive peace through the convening of an international conference  sponsored by the United Nations  in which all parties concerned and the five permanent members of the Security Council should participate.It has been said that since war begins in the minds of men it is in the minds of men that the defences for peace must be constructed. The time has come for all of us to adjust our thinking to contemporary realities and to recognize that all our efforts to promote human welfare will be in vain if a just and durable peace remains elusive. It is now 70 years since the Balfour Declaration was signed  nearly 4Ü years since Palestine was partitioned and 20 years since the Israelis occupied the West Bank  the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. I personally represent the fourth generation of my Hashemite family which had the honour of leading the great Arab revolution to gain independence and ensure prosperity for the Arab nation. But the problem of Palestine  for which my grandfather gave his life and which has been the main preoccupation of the Hashemite family for decades  remains unsettled. Time has not healed wounds; on the contrary  it has deepened them. A whole generation of Palestinians has been born and bred in refugee camps. These Palestinians have known nothing in their lives but death  horror and deprivation. It is time for the world's conscience to revolt and act decisively to resolve the Palestinian Question  including the Palestinians· right to a Palestinian homeland on Palestinian territory.The United Nations has rightly emphasized the importance of regional co-operation. We  in our region  respect this principle and look up to it. The Arab League was in fact established for that very purpose. Unfortunately  its structure has weakened over the years  not only because of internal strife and differences  but also because of external influences and interference. We consider regional co-operation to be an essential corner-stone of multilateralism. Unfortunately  recent years have witnessed a steady retreat on this front. Nations  in particular the major Powers  have increasingly resorted to bilateral dealings. In our view  this change is due more to the pursuance of short-term self-interest than to any inherent weakness in multilateralism  which must of necessity remain the corner-stone of our interdependent world.Bilateralism undoubtedly enables the major Powers to promote their own policy objectives at the expense of regional order. The policy of containment those Powers have pursued vis-à-vis conflicts in our region may have bought time for them  but it has also helped to perpetuate inherently insalubrious situations. Preservation of the status quo can never be a step towards problem-solving. More often than not  it does nothing but exacerbate the problem. In the Middle East  for instance  instead of promoting tangible progress towards peace  the time invested in preserving the status quo has strengthened the potential of irresponsible elements to obstruct rather than promote peace. Thus it can be said that the policy of containment which impedes the achievement of a just peace has nourished the motives which breed terrorism and counter terrorism and has made it possible for those who thrive on chaos  social tensions and political upheavals to pursue their interests very energetically indeed.The status quo  which has overshadowed region since the 1960s  has now become a source of factionalism and a cause of conflict between minorities and ethnic groups  thus paving the way to a vicious divide-and-rule policy that can exist only at the expense of the long-term interests of the region.If  in the first place  I have dwelt on the problem of conflict  it is because the attainment of peace in the region is our principal preoccupation and because we realize  as should all others  that insecurity anywhere is a threat to security everywhere. We do  however  fully realize that economic stability and social harmony are the prerequisites of human welfare. Thus we welcome the results of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  (UNCTAD VII)  which  despite bleak forecasts  was a relative success. There is no doubt that the inherent problems of the present world economic order urgently need to be addressed. Foremost among them is the problem of international debt. Like a malignant disease  the debt problem is spreading and taking its toll in developing countries. It is time we recognized at the international level that there is no panacea and that palliatives will not do.At the same time  let no one be under the illusion that this is a problem of the South alone. Clearly  international co-operation  cemented by mutual understanding and a recognition of interdependence  is called for if adequate and effective solutions are to be found. The earnings of more and more developing countries are now being swallowed up by mere payment of interest. There is a cash flow from the South to the North. This is clearly an aberration. It is not just a cause for concern in political or economic terms. It is also an affront to the human family that the poor should go on becoming poorer and the rich richer.When addressing UNCTAD VII  I proposed the establishment of a mixed commission composed of eminent persons of international repute to re-assess the performance of the international economic system in the context of the colossal challenges we face. Such a body should independently and impartially prepare a comprehensive executive report on the major economic issues which hamper international co-operation and suggest formulae on alternative approaches to global economic and financial problems.We in Jordan have steadfastly followed a policy of moderation in all respects. Likewise  our foreign policy has remained steadfast. Jordan's position on questions which figure on the General Assembly's agenda is well-known. We strongly condemn the policies of apartheid  and we deplore foreign occupation and support peaceful solutions to problems which have long been sources of conflict in Africa  Asia and Latin America  If I have not dwelt on those problems and conflicts  it is to save the Assembly time and not because of lack of zeal or concern on ray part.It has been said that the most important lesson of history is that men do not learn from its lessons. However  the nature of contemporary global problems is such that a basic change in thinking and in attitude is called for on the part of the human family as a whole. Despite spectacular scientific progress and technological advances  humankind has remained incapable of resolving the problems of poverty and development. It is indeed ironic that while famine was recently ravaging one continent there were mountains of grain  beef and butter causing serious storage problems in another. Penury and plenty cannot coexist without causing the human conscience to revolt. The dilemma of our times is that human wisdom has not kept pace with human knowledge  and man  alas  has not learned to be more humane. No statement in this Assembly can be complete without reference to the ultimate beneficiaries or victims of the policies and practices that we discuss here - individual human beings  whatever their creed  colour or political affiliation.Representatives may recall that in 1981 I had the honour to propose to the Assembly from this rostrum the promotion of a new international humanitarian order. Since then the General Assembly has adopted  without a vote  a series of resolutions in support of that proposal and received two reports on the subject from the Secretary-General. My proposal was inspired by the realization that in purely human terms the quality of life has been steadily degenerating over past decades  despite modern technological achievements. I stated then that whether one looked at the globe in the East-West or North-South context the overall picture continued to be grim. In human terms we are not yet ready for the next century  or even the next decade. Now  in the late 198us  that assessment remains even more valid than before.Encouraged by the support my proposal received from Member States  an Independent Commission on International Humanitarian Issues was established outside the United Nations framework to play a catalytic role and facilitate the Assembly's task of promoting the humanitarian order. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Independent Commission  which had a limited mandate in terms of time and programme of work  and which I had the honour to co-chair with His Highness Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan  has completed its final report. However  the final version will be published in coming weeks and made available to Member States for their consideration.The Commission took the view from the outset that tangible results can be achieved only if we remain specific and concentrate on a few selected issues of major concern. Consequently  а series of sectoral reports covering a range of humanitarian questions reflecting our views and containing detailed recommendation has been published. The final report is a synthesis of those reports  and we hope that it will be helpful in the process begun by this Assembly to elaborate and implement the humanitarian order. We believe that a vigorous follow-up is necessary for any report to produce the expected results. To that end  we have foreseen a series of measures in our report. In that context I should like to suggest that a small group of governmental experts be formed within the United Nations to look into practical ways and means to make further progress and ensure that the relevant recommendations are translated into action by Governments  intergovernmental and non-governmental agencies. I have no doubt that many Governments would wish to come forward on a voluntary basis to provide the require expertise.If we are to improve the human condition and make this planet a better and more secure place to live in for our children  we must not wait for things to change; we must change ourselves first. We must adjust our thinking and attitude to the new realities of the contemporary world in order to bring about a change in the global political  economic and social environment.Allow me to conclude my statement by quoting a former United Nations Secretary-General  the late Dag Hammarskjöld  who gave his life in defence of the principles and purposes of this Organization: ""Working at the edge of the development of human society is to work at the brink of the unknown. Much of what is done will one day prove to have been of little avail. That is no excuse for the failure to act in accordant with our best understanding  in recognition of its limits  but with faith in the ultimate result of the creative evolution in which it is our privilege to co-operate.""

"75",3616,"JPN",42,1987,"﻿I should like first to express my sincere congratulations to Your Excellency on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. I am confident that  with the wealth of your experience in the conduct of United Nations affairs  your superior wisdom and able leadership  you will guide this session to a successful and fruitful conclusion.At the same time I wish to express my sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury for his excellent work as President of the Assembly at its forty-first session  and especially for the co-ordinating efforts he made in launching the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations.I should also like to take this opportunity to express my profound respect to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the painstaking efforts he has been making to resolve difficult international problems  in particular the Iran-Iraq conflict.At the outset I should like to welcome most heartily the agreement that was reached in principle last week between the United States and the Soviet Union on the total elimination of intermediate-range nuclear forces and on holding a third summit meeting between the two leaders this autumn. I wish to pay a high tribute to them for the political determination that has made this possible. Speaking from this same podium nearly two years ago  at the meeting for the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  I stressed that a new global ethic  together with the systems to support it  is necessary if we are to save the earth from the gravest perils of destruction it has ever faced and ensure mankind's very survival. To that end  I expressed the need for an attitude whereby we acknowledge the diversity and value of the world's cultures and civilizations  as well as mutually appreciate and respect them. I argued that the United Nations must become a vehicle for creating  on the basis of that attitude  a global civilization for all mankind.Encouraged by the favourable response to my remarks  I should like today to share with you some of my thoughts about the practical means for pursuing my ideas  as well as Japan's position and the role it can play in this regard.We are now little more than a decade away from the twenty-first century. And as we look back  the twentieth century has been a tumultuous age  full of dramatic events and upheavals  unprecedented in human history.In the first half of the century  mankind endured two world wars and experienced the tragic explosion of nuclear weapons. Since then  we have suffered and agonized over the existence of growing stockpiles of nuclear weapons. The two nuclear super-Powers have each now deployed an enormous number of intercontinental ballistic missiles  to the extent of overkill  which could strike directly at the other's vital areas. While both sides recognize the paradox that  inherent in their guest for security through deterrence  is the danger of catastrophe  they have not yet been able to agree fully on arrangements for the reduction and elimination of nuclear arms.On the economic front  less than three decades into the century the world gave way to a rampant protectionism  inviting the disastrous Great Depression that preceded the outbreak of the Second World War. The world economy recovered from the ravages and impoverishment caused by the war f and subsequently attained unparalleled growth and prosperity. However  it was again thrown into turmoil by two oil crises - turmoil from which it has yet to fully emerge. The global economic problems we continue to face  particularly the disparities between North and South  global trade imbalances and instability in international finance  are extremely serious. On the other hand  the scientific and technological advances of this century truly dwarf those of the Industrial Revolution in the latter half of the eighteenth century  and have ushered in a new historical era. From the vast outer limits of the universe to the microscopic matter from which life itself originates  advances in human knowledge in many fields have contributed greatly to improving mankind's material well-being. Applied wisely  this knowledge can dramatically advance the information age and tremendously benefit human society. Applied unwisely  and not properly controlled  it could imperil the dignity of human life or irreversibly destroy the earth's environment  upon which all mankind depends.This century has also witnessed the birth of many independent countries as peoples everywhere  and particularly in Asia and Africa  have sought to exercise their inherent rights and freedom. One after another  these new nations joined the United Nations. The number of independent countries world-wide doubled almost overnight  imbuing international politics with new vitality and marking in world history a new era in which the ideals of freedom  equality and universal brotherhood are pursued. Mankind has not  however  eliminated poverty and hunger in some of those new countries  nor has it done away with regional conflicts.Meanwhile  as telecommunications and the means of transport continue to develop  the nations of the world are becoming ever more interdependent  and world unity is growing ever stronger. As this eventful century of tragedy and of hope draws to a close  and we look ahead to a new century  we must ask ourselves what we have learned from the traumas of the Great Depression and the two world wars  as well as subsequent experiences  and what are the lessons we should pass down to succeeding generations.Has humanity no choice but to live constantly under the threat of nuclear weapons - a sword of Damocles suspended by a single  slender thread? Have we no choice but to bequeath to posterity a planet that  in an increasing number of regions  is being stripped of its precious air and its verdant foliage  which have evolved over the course of four billion years? Can we really do no better than to pass along to the next generation a world with a burgeoning population and with countries of extreme poverty  untouched by science  technology and modern Industry?If we are to resolve these fateful issues confronting mankind  I believe it is necessary for all of us  all the countries and peoples represented here today  to reaffirm basic principles for joint action in three priority areas.Our first priority must be to secure and strengthen world peace. The State must not only serve its own people but  more important  must strive to respect and protect universal human values which transcend national boundaries. This means respecting life and human rights  protecting the irreplaceable natural environment  and preserving those cultural traditions that are the product of human wisdom and labour over the course of many centuries. These values must be respected under any system of government or ideology. This does not of course imply that a State may unjustly expand its power beyond its own borders.Our second priority must be to provide vastly expanded guarantees for the free flow of people  information and culture across national borders. I have speculated elsewhere that the Second World War would probably not have occurred had there been  satellite television broadcasts that were freely received  so that peoples everywhere could have identified with each other as members of the same human race  indeed  I believe that the guaranteed freer movement of people and information would provide an important safeguard against a third world war  for avoiding a repetition of atrocities  and for enabling peoples everywhere to share in the joy of living together  amid the rich cultural diversity the world offers.Our third priority must be to rectify regional disparities and protect the global environment. For this purpose  each State must refrain from exercising its sovereignty merely for its own self-interests  and must strive to strengthen a framework of international co-operation centred on the United Nations. As we approach the twenty-first century  we must find new ways to enhance the capacity of a global authority.Ή. G. Wells once said that ""our true nationality is mankind"". As members of the global village that transcends national boundaries  each of us should be challenged by our conscience to apply all the wisdom we have reaped during this century to find solutions to the problems facing us.In my statement here two years ago  I called for a 'global ethic"". And just now  I referred to the ""global village"". These are terms that will surely come into common world-wide use in the twenty-first century  for it is clear  on the one hand  that exchanges and interdependence among countries and peoples will increase dramatically  and  on the other  that all mankind will increasingly face the danger of total annihilation  should the fruits of modern civilization be misused. Men and women of the twenty-first century will simply have to think of themselves as citizens of the global village. A basic principle of life in the village is mutual help. In my home village  if someone did not have a bowl of rice  others would share their rice with him. The same philosophy holds true for the global village. John and Ivan belong to the same village  where there are no distinctions. It is precisely for this reason that the United Nations Charter admonishes us ""to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours"" as a first step towards realizing its lofty purposes.Thus far I have stressed the goals that we should pursue  as well as some rather idealistic principles to guide us as we cross the threshold of the 21st century. I should now like to discuss some issues posed by the harsh realities of today's world.First of all  it is essential to strive to build the confidence needed for the eventual total elimination of nuclear weapons and realization of peaceful coexistence. The agreement reached in principle by the United States and the Soviet Union last week to conclude a treaty on the total elimination of intermediate nuclear forces constitutes the first accord In history for the reduction of nuclear weapons and is a major step forward in this field. As one who has been strongly advocating the complete global elimination of Intermediate nuclear forces  I sincerely welcome this good news. I hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will  as a next step  realize promptly and steadily the plan to reduce strategic nuclear weapons drastically  by 50 per cent  while maintaining a balance of deterrence.The success of such efforts will engender feelings of affinity among the peoples of both nations and win universal support for those efforts. Further V progress can then be made on disarmament and nuclear and conventional weapons  as well as chemical and other weapons  and on strengthening the regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This in turn will surely lead to progress in resolving regional problems and open up new avenues towards world peace. I believe that a world truly at peace is the greatest gift we can bequeath to posterity.I have taken every opportunity to urge both the United States and the Soviet Union to make genuine progress towards nuclear disarmament as quickly as possible. For my part  I shall continue to co-operate towards the success of those efforts.It is very likely that in the final stages of the negotiations on these difficult issues a range of obstacles will arise as details are scrutinized and the formal texts of agreements drafted. It is precisely at this point that the solution to problems should not be left to bureaucrats or military personnel  but must be entrusted to the political wisdom of statesmen who have a far-sighted sense of responsibility to mankind. I sincerely hope that the leaders of both countries  as true statesmen  will make wise political decisions that will long be remembered.I should like on this occasion to express the strong hope that the Soviet leadership will take a constructive stance in its policy towards Asia and  with regard to Japan in particular  will work with determination to settle the territorial problem and other pending issues  acting in such a way as to build a genuine relationship of trust.The problems that have been created in the 20th century are our responsibility) we must not pass them on unresolved to the 21st century.The second urgent issue is the need to mount concerted efforts to resolve the grave problems confronting the world economy. In order to promote world economic growth and prosperity  it is essential that the policies of all countries be harmonized and  in particular  that protectionism be resisted. The Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has been  launched as a means of combating protectionism  and we must work diligently to ensure that its goals are achieved.We must not regard the many difficulties confronting the countries of the South simply as the fate of mankind and become resigned to them. While self-help efforts by their leaders and their peoples are obviously essential for the solution of their problems  certain problems  such as recent debt accumulation and export difficulties  are due in part to changes in the world economic and industrial structure for which the countries of the South cannot be held solely responsible.Whenever economic failure occurs in any part of the world it is incumbent upon all of us  for the sake of the people in the region as well as of world economic stability  to address the problem and promptly devise all possible means of co-operation in order to avert a crisis. Such co-operation is already evident in the activities of international financial organizations and in various joint efforts among many countries. We should reaffirm our determination to promote these effective efforts even more clearly. Only in this way will all the peoples of the world be able truly to consider themselves members of one human race joined together in a solidarity that transcends national boundaries. At the same time  the nations of the South will be greatly encouraged in their self-help efforts.Recognizing that there can be no prosperity for Japan without world prosperity  my country is making every effort to revitalize the world economy and provide assistance to developing countries  while at the same time promoting the internationalisation of its own economy. Deeply aware of its tremendous responsibilities  Japan is determined to make even greater contributions to the international community.Since last year Japan has been pursuing a programme to recycle up to $30 billion and has been implementing a plan to provide $500 million in grant assistance to sub-Saharan and other African countries over three years. I look forward to discussing the further implementation of these projects with the countries concerned. On the question of economic co-operation  I believe that it is especially important to promote exchanges among young people and among young business managers  together with the concomitant transfer of technology. At the same time  looking ahead to the 2l8t century  we believe that human resources development and human interaction are all-important in order to achieve progress in public administration and education  and Japan is fully co-operating towards this end ·A third issue concerns the settlement of regional problems The roost urgent of the tasks facing us today is to end the conflict between Iran and Iraq which is entering its eighth year  and to re-establish peace in the land that is the cradle of world civilization and return calm to the waters of the Gulf.Recently  the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 598 (1987) .This resolution was drafted paying the greatest possible attention in the circumstances to the positions of the parties concerned· The Council expects the Secretary-General  who enjoys the trust of both parties  to play a key role in its implementation in the belief that there is no other way to resolve this Issue  I strongly urge both parties to put an end to the conflict as soon as possible and establish lasting peace  as called for by the resolution. For its part  Japan has been working to the best of its ability for the restoration of peace  and now in the context of its membership of the Security Council as well# is making every effort in good faith towards that end. At the same time  my country intends to continue to support the vigorous efforts of the Secretary-General. The people of the world earnestly desire to see the Iran-Iraq conflict ended  and I am steadfast in my hope that both countries will respond to that desire and act with sound judgement.Moreover  I must emphasize that as a general principle it is of utmost importance for the termination of any conflict and the establishment of peace that all countries strictly refrain from providing weapons to either party.Elsewhere  it is most regrettable that no concrete progress has been made towards a satisfactory solution to the problems in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. All foreign military forces should be withdrawn completely and without delay from both regions. Japan strongly supports the establishment there of sovereign States that are truly democratic  independent  non-aligned and neutral.The apartheid policy of the Government of South Africa flagrantly violates the principle of racial equality and respect for human rights and roust be abolished promptly and completely. On the Korean Peninsula  parties from the south and the north should  through direct negotiations  seek to ease tensions and achieve peaceful reunification. I support  as one step towards reunification  the admission of both the south and the north to the United Nations. I fervently hope that at next year's Seoul Olympics all the nations of the world will join together in full participation to make the Games once more a truly global festival and that through sports East-West friendship will be promoted and  in particular  tensions on the Korean Peninsula eased.Further  mankind has not been able to escape from the feat of conflicts and wars resulting from human rivalry   nor has it been able to avoid the devastation of major natural disasters. On this occasion  I should like to stress the need for the United Nations to improve and strengthen its capacity to help expeditiously and effectively to prevent natural disasters and render rescue services.Next  I should like to say a few words about how we can brighten the prospects for the world as it approaches the 21st century and how Japan can co-operate in realizing these aspirations.Very briefly  I feel that we will see emerging a world-wide trend in which people free themselves from the fetters of the dogmatic ideologies of the 19th century  in part this will happen because the earnest desire of people everywhere to escape swiftly from the persistent threat of nuclear weapons transcends all ideologies. Also  people everywhere  regardless of the political and social systems under which they live  are increasingly aware that fundamental economic logic  which is based on freedom and creativity  is stronger than ideology.This trend is manifested in the strong global support for the prompt holding of a United states-soviet summit meeting and the fight against excessive central control and protectionism in the economic policies of East and West. As this emerging trend comes to fruition in both democratic and socialist countries and becomes universal  the influence of rigid ideologies will Inevitably decline and the world will move from confrontation to reconciliation  from conflict to co-operation. Then the potential will become apparent for nurturing the creation of a harmonious world order of a new dimension in which a realistic and practical approach is valued.Now I should like to say a little more about my views on overcoming the East-West impasse. The present East-West confrontation is  unfortunately  largely rooted in the structural constraints of the International community  which consists of sovereign States. When we talk to one another face to face we find that  people of every country belong to the same human race and are basically of good will. Yet  once within the framework of a State  it seems that people often change as they are manipulated by State institutions and stand in the front lines of confrontation and rivalry between States. In this sense  one cannot but conclude that in today's international community confrontation and discord between the State and the Individual will never be completely overcome.It is by no means easy for those entrusted with the actual responsibilities of national government to escape this reality. Inherent in nuclear weapons is the dilemma that  although they have the potential for catastrophic destruction  one side feels it must possess them as long as the other side does in order to maintain mutual deterrence. We must find a way out of this impasse so that we can free ourselves from suspicion and fear and return to a world of security and trust. Indeed  would this not once again make our conscience our central guide?The convening of the United States-Soviet summit in Reykjavik in 1986 and the progress achieved there towards an agreement were  so to speak  bright rays of hope for escape from the karma that has prevailed ever since the end of the Second World War. This historic collaboration on disarmament has stirred a fresh breeze of harmony and co-operation world wide  and I am hopeful that it will help generate energy that can be directed in particular to assisting the poorest countries  the developing countries and those with accumulated debts  as well as to preserving the global environment. As the history of Indo-China and the present situation of Afghanistan both so graphically testify  war does not solve problems  on the contrary  it destabilizes the societies of the countries concerned. But have we not reached a crossroads in international politics where through the wisdom of statesmen from every country the course of history can be redirected?It has been about half a century since the systems of the East and West blocs emerged. People in both camps have had pride and confidence in their own systems  but there must also have been times when they experienced doubt. It is high time that we made a greater effort to get to know the realities of the different societies that our fellow men have created. Given the fact that it is now possible to use satellite telecommunications for real-time exchanges of information  should not both sides frankly and honestly open their hearts and show each other the realities of their own countries?It is in this sense I am convinced that  if President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev as responsible individuals belonging to the same human race  can through their third meeting establish a genuine relationship of trust  it will pave the way for all mankind to enter a new era of peaceful dialogue and competitive coexistence throughout the four corners of the globe. Moreover  a phenomenon that transcends the East-West confrontation is now emerging in the economic management of many countries throughout the world. I am referring to the fact that the trend  for example  towards liberalization and the strengthening of market economy principles is spreading. The fact that these terms are gaining common currency everywhere demonstrates that economic logic is being applied increasingly all over the globe. Recently  in developing regions throughout the world and particularly in the Asia-Pacific area near Japan  newly industrialized countries with spectacular growth rates have been emerging. I believe that this has been possible because the countries there have taken advantage of these economic principles and are pursuing policies that tap the energies of their peoples. I am thus most interested in seeing what will be the actual changes in the foreign and domestic policies of the Soviet Union as a result of the perestroika and glasnost is undertaking  and of China as a result of its policy of opening up to the outside world.It is our mission to make this planet Earth  the only home mankind has  a verdant place of peace and freedom. While it is incumbent upon all international organizations to serve this goal  the United Nations is the only global forum that is active in maintaining peace  protecting human tights and enhancing the well-being of all peoples. The responsibilities of the United Nations are tremendous and its continued existence is crucial.It is unfortunately true that the United Nations has not fully lived up to the expectations of it at its founding. It is thus easy to criticize the Organization. Yet  were there no United Nations  how could we possibly maintain order and enhance our common well-being in today's complex international arena? Where else could we find a forum for reflecting the opinions of States all over the world  for bridging the gaps between East and West  North and South? It is precisely at these times of difficulty for the United Nations that we should consider what would happen if it did not exist  and devote ourselves to defending  strengthening and improving the Organization. The United Nations roust become a true United nations. Above all is the need to strengthen its peace-keeping functions. For its part  my country has been malting active efforts to support United Nations peace-keeping operations  mainly through financial assistance. Japan intends to study further how it can contribute even more to strengthening them in the future. Ever since its admission  Japan has made the United Nations a central pillar foreign policy  and has been making earnest efforts to strengthen and improve the Organization. However  enormous changes have taken place in the international situation and in the United Nations in the years since it was founded. The number of Member States is now far greater than was envisaged at the time of the Organization's founding  and this has not only resulted in making it a colourful mosaic of distinctive characteristics  but is also presenting new and unforeseen issues for its agenda as we enter a new era of civilization. If the United Nations is to be able to respond expeditiously to these changes  it must constantly be reformed. I also believe that in specialized fields  such as economics  the tendency unduly to politicise issues should be corrected.I hope all Member States will join together to consider these problems with a view to determining the kind of organization the United Nations should become in the future.If the twentieth century has been an age of destruction  with two world wars and the tragedy of the first nuclear explosions  the next century must be one bathed in the radiant sunshine of peace. Until now peace has prevailed only intermittently  between successive wars. Maintaining and managing peace  and ensuring that it is lasting  will of course be an extremely complex and difficult task. But is it not the obligation of today's statesmen to confront squarely such epochal challenges? The United Nations is  after all  a hall of peace  where statesmen gather and  with the establishment of lasting peace as their common goal  work together with determination and tolerance to nurture and preserve diverse values and cultures  and to enhance the dignity of mankind. On this occasion I pledge that  together with representatives here  I shall shoulder the grave responsibilities placed upon me as one of the statesmen gathered here at the United Nations·The current session of the General Assembly  in anticipation of the United States-Soviet summit for the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons  is filled with hope for the future of mankind. Indeed  this is the most significant session in the history of the Organization for ensuring peace and coexistence. Let us work together in the earnest hope that rich blessings will be bestowed upon our children and upon the Earth in the twenty-first century. )The American poet  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  taught us in his poem  ""A Psalm of Life""  to act so that each tomorrow finds us farther along the road than today. I should like to conclude my remarks with the closing stanza of that poem:""Let us  then  be up and doing With a heart for any fate;Still achieving  still pursuing.Learn to labour and to wait·"""
"76",3688,"KEN",42,1987,"﻿It gives me pleasure to join other speakers who have preceded me and to convey to you  Sir  my delegation's warm congratulations upon your election to the high office of the presidency of this forty-second session. I should further like to extend to your predecessor  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  our appreciation for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the business of the forty-first session. Permit me also to express our gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our Secretary-General  for the able manner in which he has continued to guide his team of international civil servants in the service of the international community. Forty-two years ago the tragedy of the Second World War called for the creation of an effective international arrangement to prevent the recurrence of a world war. The fundamental lesson learned in the wake of that war is to be found in the opening words of the Charter  which speaks of the determination of the peoples of the United Nations to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. The founders of the Organization reaffirmed  further  their faith in fundamental human rights  the dignity and worth of the human person and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. Those noble ideals and objectives  among others  constitute the guiding spirit of the people and Government of Kenya.Since the founding of the Organization  one of its greatest achievements has been the catalytic role it played in the decolonization process. In the 1960s and 1970s a large number of peoples and Territories exercised their right to self-determination and achieved their national independence. They have since taken their rightful places as full  equal and active members of the comity of nations. Regrettably  however  pockets of colonialism  which must be eradicated  still remain in Africa and elsewhere.Though the immediate post-war years saw the establishment of the United Nations and were characterized by relative international peace and security  decolonization and socio-economic progress  the present international political climate and socio-economic environment appear sombre by comparison. One of the paradoxical developments of our time has been the replacement of colonialism and foreign domination by super-Power rivalry for spheres of influence. The most powerful States  to which special responsibility was entrusted by the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security  have become engulfed in a bitter rivalry for control of the world's resources and for an extension of their political and economic influence through devious and unethical devices  including interference in the internal affairs of weak developing States and economic blackmail of them. This trend is not conducive to the promotion of peaceful coexistence among sovereign States  and must be arrested.I now turn to specific issues of which the Assembly has been seized over the years and which have remained potentially explosive  thereby threatening international peace and security.The failure to find a just and durable solution to the question of Palestine remains the basic cause of the continued tension and instability in the Middle East. In this context we support the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East. We consider that for a just and lasting peace to prevail In the region it must be recognized that every State there has the right to exist within internationally recognized boundaries. By the same token  we believe that no solution to the Middle East problem is possible without the establishment of an independent State for millions of displaced and homeless Palestinian people.With regard to the situation in Afghanistan  no durable solution can be found to the problem while foreign troops remain in that country. We therefore call for the withdrawal o£ all foreign troops from Afghanistan. Similarly  we support the call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea. On the Iraq-Iran war  we join the many delegates who have called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and support Security Council resolution 598 (1987) of 20 July 1987 and subsequent efforts by the Secretary-General in that regard. Concerning the Korean Peninsula  Kenya firmly believes that direct contact is the best way to reduce tension in the area  leading to a peaceful solution of the Korean question  in conformity with the three principles of independence  peaceful reunification  and great national unity  as set forth in the North-South Joint Statement of 4 July 1972.	 In Central America  we applaud the efforts of the leaders of the region in their continued search for peace and the democratic process. In this context  we support the evolution of the peace process as initiated by the Contadora Group  augmented by the Support Group and culminating in the Guatemala agreement  which seeks to establish firm and lasting peace in the region. In this connection  we reject externally imposed solutions.At home in Africa  the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa continue to suffer the indignity of the evil system of apartheid  despite a clear and universal consensus that the system of apartheid is evil  cannot be reformed and must be dismantled. Various measures proposed to accelerate the destruction and demise of apartheid have met with stubborn and aggressive resistance launched by the racist regime  with the support of its allies and major trading partners. This resistance has made it impossible for the Security Council unanimously to agree on measures necessary to undo apartheid. We firmly maintain that there is a moral duty on every country and people to ensure the total destruction of this abhorrent system.In the struggle to liberate South Africa from the tentacles of apartheid  we salute  and declare our unwavering solidarity with  the peoples of South Africa in their struggle against oppression  exploitation and denial of the right to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination. We therefore continue to demand the unconditional and immediate release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and detainees  so that they can participate fully in the political process in South Africa. Similarly  we call for the immediate lifting of the state of emergency  the ban on the liberation movements operating both inside and outside South Africa  and other oppressive measures. The current wave of censorship of news  escalated repression  indiscriminate detention  torture and murder of the black population  and aggression against the front-line States gives even more urgent reasons for the Assembly strongly to urge the Security Council unanimously to impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist regime  because of its persistent defiance of the demand by the international community that it dismantle apartheid.The world has for a long time been treated to a series of deceitful manoeuvres and tactics all designed to delay indefinitely Namibia's genuine independence or to substitute for an independent Government a puppet administration subservient to  > and controlled by  the racist regime. These evasive moves by South Africa to delay further Namibian independence must be brought to an end. We call upon the Security Council to convene immediately and take a firm decision with respect to the implementation of its resolution 435 (1978)   which remains the only internationally acceptable basis for the independence of Namibia. We now urge the Security Council to adopt an enabling resolution to trigger the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia's independence. This session is held against the background of a situation where the solution of the major problem of our time  namely  the elimination of nuclear danger  has entered a new phase. The ongoing negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union in Geneva and elsewhere fairly demonstrate that they have embraced the commitment of intent to reduce offensive weapons systems. They have also shown the world that significant progress in disarmament can be attained if there is political will on their part to engage in genuine dialogue and negotiations. We welcome the recently concluded agreement between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as the first ever involving an attempt at dismantling a certain category of nuclear weapons. Any success to this end should lead to further agreements on the larger issues of disarmament. Consequently  Kenya will continue to support the work of the Conference on Disarmament and the efforts of the super-Powers at arms limitation.The recently concluded Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development formally recognized and accepted that there does exist a relationship between disarmament and development. To this end  reduction of military consumption of resources could lead to a healthier international co-operation for development.I turn now to some legal aspects of the work of the United Nations which are of special interest to my delegation. Since the Law of the Sea Convention was adopted in 1982  the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has been meeting to translate the laudable principles enshrined in the Convention to a reality. My Government has noted that although the preparatory work for the implementation of the Convention and bringing into being a universal regime for the exploration and exploitation of the deep sea-bed has been disappointingly slow  the last few sessions of the Preparatory Commission have registered encouraging progress. We therefore welcome the decision of the Commission  on 17 August  in registering the first pioneer investor. Kenya looks forward to the evolution of a practical sea-bed mining regime that will assure the international community as a whole the full benefits of the resources in the deep sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction which are the common heritage of mankind.Over the past year the world economy has continued to lurch on an uncertain and perilous course. This assessment is fully corroborated by the overall thrust of our general debate here and by various analyses available before this Assembly. This adverse trend has been punctuated by stagnant and sluggish growth and widening disparities  by increasing imbalances and inequities which operate to the detriment of the developing countries. As a result the burden of economic adjustments is being disproportionately shifted to the vulnerable economies of the developing countries  thus seriously impeding their economic growth and stultifying their development efforts.This persistent world economic crisis has dealt a severely damaging blow to practically all the developing countries. Many of them are already mired in economic stagnation. Further contraction of their development process would not only undermine the social and political fabric of their societies but also pose an added threat to international peace and security. In order to avoid such grim scenarios  there is no alternative but to strive for an early resumption of world economic growth  reactivation of the development process  in particular in the developing countries  and a drastic reduction of disparities between the developing economies and those of the developed countries.International trade has traditionally been a vital engine for growth. Regrettably this function has now been gravely impaired. Rampant protectionism and numerous distorting devices  such as tariff barriers  export subsidies and voluntary quotas  together with numerous non-tariff barriers  in contravention or in circumvention of the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have in recent years eroded the effective functioning of the international trading system. Moreover  the commitments by the developed countries to ""stand still"" and ""roll back"" protectionist measures remain practically unimplemented. In fact the liberalization of international trade has not only slackened but has also run counter to the interests of the developing countries  resulting in insurmountable constrictions of their exports and severe impediments to their access to international markets. It is indeed a telling indictment of the present international trading system that the share of the developing countries in international trade has risen only very modestly over the past two decades.Moreover  their trade with developed countries has declined while manufactures imported from those countries have at the same time increased considerably and now represent a substantial portion of the total exports of the developed countries.It is almost impossible for us to discuss international trade without singling out commodities. The crash in commodity prices and the near disastrous situation in commodity markets warrant our serious and close attention. This crippling situation has affected the majority of the developing countries where commodity exports account for most of their export earnings. We are deeply disappointed with the operations of some of the existing commodity agreements. However  we urge the need to pursue the full implementation of the Integrated Programme for Commodities  including making the Common Fund operational as quickly as possible  to complete the pending negotiations on individual commodity agreements and to improve the system of compensatory financing facilities.At the heart of the current ""development crisis"" is the inadequacy of international flow of financial resources. Sharp declines in commercial bank loans and private foreign investments have accentuated the problem of reduced net disbursements from official development assistance sources. Consequently  since the early 1980s the developing countries have ironically become net suppliers of capital rather than net recipients. This reversal of financial flows is central to the payments difficulties and financial crisis facing the developing countries. The external debt crisis is the most visible manifestation of these reversals and casts a dark cloud over the entire international financial system. Few  and perhaps none  of the developing countries have been spared its adverse effects. The external debt crisis has reached alarming proportions engulfing the majority of the developing countries worldwide. Despite the most painful and strenuous adjustments by the developing debtor countries  debt servicing is also rapidly growing beyond their capacities to contain it and beyond their ability to withstand the resultant political and social pressures.Kenya was particularly encouraged by the positive and business-like climate which prevailed in the deliberations at the recently concluded seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  It is worth recalling here that UNCTAD VII was unique in that its substantive discussions remained positive  non-confrontational and constructive. We managed  for the first time in the history of UNCTAD  to adopt by consensus a Final Act recommending a number of policy approaches and measures to deal with debt problems  resources for development and related monetary issues  commodities  international trade and the problems of the least developed countries. It is now for the international community as a whole to work out the modalities for the implementation of the conclusions of UNCTAD VII and translate them into reality. The General Assembly has a major role to play in this exercise  and I urge that before we conclude our current session we should be able to agree on the necessary modalities to enable us to put into practice the content of the Final Act as adopted by consensus in Geneva on 3 August.It is true that the magnitude of Africa's development crisis was spelt out at the thirteenth special session of the Assembly. The adoption by consensus of the United Nations Programme of Action for Africa's Economic Recovery and Development 19B6-1990 raised great hopes for Africa's economic recovery. Regrettably  the international community has not yet adequately responded to the commitments it undertook in the Programme of Action. Kenya and other African countries are aware and convinced that the expected assistance from the international community as expressed in that Programme of Action can only supplement their own efforts. In this connection  and as will be observed from the records of the recent summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity  economic recovery and development continue to be given topmost priority by our Governments. African Governments have also adopted a series of bold and radical measures to save their economies from collapse and ensure fundamental restructuring and policy orientation geared to re-launching the continent on the path to self-sustained development.We have come to the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly in the hope that it will be able to establish mechanisms for the evaluation of the implementation of the Programme of Action. Kenya will participate fully  together with other Member States  to ensure a successful culmination of such exercise. At this stage we wish to reiterate once more the significance of the important role that can and should be played by the international community as a whole in the implementation process of the Programme of Action. We therefore appeal for the expeditious adoption of realistic measures to mobilize the resources required for the successful implementation of the Programme  since time is not very much in our favour.We all recognize the mutual advantages that could accrue from economic co-operation between developed and developing countries and also from co-operation between developing countries. Economic co-operation among developing countries should not  however  be seen as in any way the application of an isolationist policy. Rather  it is aimed at achieving international co-operation of wider scope. Kenya has continued to work closely with  particularly  other countries of east  central and southern Africa in pursuit of different types of economic trade and other forms of co-operation. Kenya is a member of the Preferential Trade Area (PTA)  which encompasses 15 member States of eastern and southern Africa  with a market potential of well over 160 million people. We are also actively involved in the 6-member-State Djibouti-based Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development  one of whose objectives is to give member states early warnings on drought  which continues to plague most parts of the continent. In the recent past we have also concluded agreements with most of our neighbours establishing joint consultative economic commissions  including sectoral commissions.It will be recalled that the Assembly  cognizant of the close interrelationship of economic development and environmental issues  established the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1983  through resolution 38/161. Today the Assembly has before it the report of the Commission  entitled ""Our Common Future"". I wish to record my delegation's appreciation of that excellent document  which we feel will be useful as reference material on the related issues of development and the environment. We congratulate Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland  Prime Minister of Norway  who so ably presided over the Commission. The Commission's propositions are consistent with policies adopted by the Government of Kenya  particularly on issues related to food security  energy  industry  housing and human settlements  to mention but a few. Kenya continues to appreciate and support the United Nations Environment Programme for its commendable work in the field of the environment.In another interrelated area  that of human settlements  I wish to put on record the Government of Kenya's appreciation of the role that the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT)  working closely with Governments and other concerned institutions  has continued to play to improve shelter conditions all over the world  particularly for the poorer and disadvantaged segments of the society. I also wish at this stage to reiterate the Kenya Government's full commitment to the right of all persons to an adequate standard of living  including adequate housing for themselves and their families. This year is being observed as the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless  which was successfully celebrated on the tenth anniversary of the formation of the Commission on Human Settlements  in April  at HABITAT headquarters in Nairobi  Kenya. The International Year of Shelter for the Homeless has provided an impetus in mobilizing governmental  non-governmental and international support for shelter problems. We wish to appeal for continued support for the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in order to enable it to cope with the pressing challenges of our time relating to shelter and homelessness.This year has also witnessed the successful holding of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  in June  in Vienna  Austria. Indeed  that Conference was an important milestone and a rich experience for most of us. We managed to adopt by consensus both the Declaration and the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future Activities in Drug-Abuse Control. The Vienna recommendations set forth practical measures that could contribute to the fight against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. It is now for the Assembly to work out modalities for the implementation of the Vienna Declaration  together with its Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future Activities in Drug-Abuse Control. Kenya will co-operate fully with other Member States towards the realization of such an endeavour.Finally  let me recall here that we fully share the notion that peace cannot be maintained in a world where one third of the population lives in economic splendour while the other two thirds continue to wallow in the vicious grip of economic squalor  misery and human degradation. In promoting the establishment of a new international economic order and further strengthening international peace and security the United Nations system has  over the years  continued to pursue a noble task whose objectives are manifestly enshrined in the very ideals and objectives of the United Nations Charter. Since Member States are solemnly committed to those ideals and objectives  each Member State has a role that it can and must continue to play now. It is imperative that we make positive efforts to perceive our interdependence in a more comprehensive and enlightened perspective  for it is only through such a perception that meaningful recommendations and concrete action-oriented programmes can be evolved  quickly agreed upon and thereafter implemented. Regarding the ongoing review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations  Kenya will continue to support initiatives or measures designed to strengthen the efficient functioning of the Organization. We will however resist any attempt to tamper with the fundamental principles and purposes of the Charter. Accordingly  in the implementation of resolution 41/213  care must be taken to ensure strict compliance with the provisions of the Charter.At this forty-second session of the General Assembly  we wish once again to reaffirm our commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and our respect for the rule of law enshrined in various international instruments. Such respect  in our view  constitutes the only guarantee of the continued preservation of the basic rules of conduct between States  the only guarantee of the maintenance of international peace and security.I wish to conclude by wishing you  Mr. President  the Secretary-General and all representatives gathered here continued good health and success in our individual and joint pursuit of international peace  security and development."
"77",3759,"KHM",42,1987,"﻿May I be permitted first of all to extend to Mr. Peter Florin my deepest personal congratulations on his election to the presidency of this Assembly and to wish him full success in his mission.Today I have the great honour to deliver the message of His Royal Highness Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  President of Democratic Kampuchea  addressed to the forty-second session of the Assembly. This is the message of His Royal Highness; ""It is a pleasure for me to extend to Mr. Peter Florin  on behalf of the people of Democratic Kampuchea  their Coalition Government and on my own behalf  our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session. His political and diplomatic experience  as well as his great personal skill  are tokens that will ensure the success of our work. ""May I be permitted to pay an earnest tribute to his honourable predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  an eminent son of Bangladesh  who has brilliantly proved himself to be a man of remarkable diplomatic skills  of wisdom and impartiality in conducting the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.""Last but not least  I should like to render a fervent and ringing homage to our very distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whom we hold in very high esteem. I am particularly pleased to stress that his untiring and deserving efforts strengthen the confidence we have always had in him. His faith in the United Nations Charter and his dedication to fulfilling his high mandate  which is both complex and exacting  and often thankless  have greatly contributed to strengthening the role of our world Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security.""My country  Cambodia  has the tragic misfortune of being the prey long coveted by its big predatory neighbour  Viet Nam  whose half-century-old ambition to absorb it into its 'Indo-China Federation' is now well known to all. Never in their long history have the Cambodian people endured such cruel humiliation  grief  misery and suffering as that sown by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam since 25 December 1978  the day of the invasion of my country.""Like Hitler's Panzer divisions which were dispatched for the so-called liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and Poland in 1939  the Vietnamese divisions sent to Cambodia for its so-called liberation  in their blitzkrieg and later in their countless mopping-up operations  razed entire villages  looted and destroyed public and private property  crops  fields and rice fields  and massacred or starved to death hundreds of thousands of Cambodians. With a view to eliminating any kind of resistance to their so-called liberation  the Vietnamese forces did not hesitate to use toxic chemical and bacteriological weapons to suppress all those whom they could not reach with their conventional weapons. Excelling in the art of turning themselves into victims and shifting the responsibility for their crimes on to others  the leaders in Hanoi have baptized their occupation of Cambodia 'national defence' against an 'undeclared war'. Proceeding under that banner  they forcibly conscripted tens of thousands of Cambodians aged between 15 and 45 and sent them to the battlefields to fight and die for the defence of the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. Since 1984  under the pretence of 'labour in defence of the motherland' and 'jungle clearing'  they have conscripted more than 1 million men and women  young and old alike  and sent them to carry out forced paramilitary labour in mine infested battlefields and malaria and endemic disease-ridden mountainous and forest areas. Several tens of thousands of those conscripts have been killed by mines or maimed for life  while many hundreds of thousands of others have been stricken by malaria. In the name of the 'Viet Nam-Kampuchea special friendship and solidarity'  hundreds of thousands of Cambodian villagers have been expelled militarily and their houses  fields and rice fields have been expropriated and later distributed to Vietnamese settlers who already number more than 700 000  I systematically sent to settle in Cambodia  within the framework of a well-defined settlement policy. ""In the currently occupied areas where  according to Vietnamese propaganda  a marvellous rebirth has been taking place  the population is subjugated  oppressed  arrested  imprisoned  tortured and killed under the slightest pretext or suspicion in the very presence of Vietnamese 'experts'  or simply sent to the notorious re-education camps from where people never return. The Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh regime is one of terror and oppression. ""This entire exercise of physical elimination is carried out in parallel with a planned attempt to eliminate the Khmer culture. Cambodia's history  and in particular that of its relations with Viet Nam  is rewritten/ while in schools maps already show Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea as a single geographical entity. The ultimate goal is all-out Vietnamization  body and soul  of Cambodia as in the cases of the Islamic Kingdom of Champa  which was absorbed in the seventeenth century to form the present-day Central Viet Nam  and of Lower Cambodia - Kampuchea Krom - which was annexed to form the present-day South Viet Nam  In order to escape from this Vietnamese steamroller  almost a million Cambodians have been obliged to go into exile and inside the country millions of others have fled their native villages and lands to seek refuge in remote areas or in areas controlled by our national resistance forces.""For many people  first the invasion of Cambodia and then the array and scale of the crimes committed by the leaders in Hanoi called for a heart-rending explanation. They did not understand why those same people  who for a span of 30 years of resolute patriotic struggle had managed to make their people and country a symbol of resistance to foreign domination and of struggle for national independence should have revealed themselves almost overnight to be - as we have known them to be for many centuries - a perfect model of an anachronistic imperialism  the expansionist strategy of which has become a principle of Government.""Nevertheless the persistence of the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia has enabled the most sceptical  and even some supporters of Viet Nam  to face the facts. The longer this occupation lasts  the greater is the evidence of Vietnamese crimes in Cambodia. Moreover  the obstinate refusal of the leaders in Hanoi to withdraw their forces and allow the Cambodian people to exercise their right to self-determination  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions  reveals their will to pursue at all costs their policy of Indochina Federation'  Despite their repeated denials  that policy is very much alive. In addition to numerous past and present proofs there is a quite recent one.""According to directives broadcast on 6 June 1987  the first objective of the celebration of the thirty-sixth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of the puppets in Phnom Phen was; to demonstrate clearly that the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party has its origin in the Indochinese Communist Party founded by President Ho Chi Minh and that all the victories of the Kampuchean revolution have always been linked with the revolution of Viet Nam and Laos. '""One of the keynotes of this celebration was that:'President Ho Chi Minh  founder of the Indochinese Communist Party  lives forever in the revolutionary cause of our country. '""I shall not add any comment to that exuberant and enthusiastic pride of the Phnom Phen puppets at being Viet Nam's subjects and working for the elimination of the identity of their own nation.""Judging by the endless flow of the ill-fated boat people  the regime imposed on the Vietnamese people by the leaders in Hanoi is one of the worst dictatorships that have ever existed in the world. More than a million Vietnamese - men  women  children  the elderly - have already fled their native country  preferring to risk their future to the often deadly perils of the sea rather than to living under the repressive regime imposed upon them. Thousands of others continue to do so every month. Who can still believe that the Vietnamese leaders are philanthropists who have mobilized all the resources of their country and sent hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese soldiers to fight and die for the freedom of the Cambodian people when they have not been able to ensure a decent standard of living for their own people? The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has never believed that and every year  by an overwhelming majority  it adopts a resolution which  inter alia  'reaffirms that the continuing illegal occupation of Kampuchea by foreign* - that is Vietnamese - 'forces deprives the people of Kampuchea of the exercise of their right to self-determination and constitutes the primary violation of human rights in Kampuchea at present. ' The resolution also stresses that  inter alia  'the continuing illegal occupation of Kampuchea and the reported demographic changes in Kampuchea are a threat to the survival of the Kanpuchean people and culture.'""The Vietnamese crimes in Cambodia bear witness to the fact that the war stirred up and sustained by the leaders in Hanoi is not an ordinary war of aggression as witnessed so far in world history but rather a war of genocide. As a corollary  they show that we have the right to fight against an implacable and perfidious enemy  whose cynicism is equalled only by the refinement of its hideous crimes. They explain why the sacred goal of our struggle  beyond the liberation of our motherland  is the very survival of our nation and people  the preservation of our national identity.""In 1979  after the Vietnamese blitzkrieg  the situation in Kampuchea was very gloomy and even  for many people  desperate; indeed it seemed inconceivable that small  weak Cambodia could oppose a Viet Nam 10 times more populated  infatuated with its powerful army - ranking third in the world - puffed up with pride after a long and  in addition  strongly supported and armed by the Soviet Union. For the Vietnamese leaders  the Cambodia case was definitively settled  the situation being irreversible and their dream of an Indochina federation being at last realized. Today it is well known to all that this dream  far from being a reality  has truly turned into a nightmare.""The scale and the enormity of the Vietnamese crimes have accelerated the national resistance  which is now mobilizing the entire people and an increasing number of soldiers  self-defence guards and civil servants at every level of the puppet Phnom Phen regime as they become aware of the real meaning of the struggle - which means the very survival of their nation and their national identity. The unceasing and extensive attacks launched by the national resistance forces in order to dismantle the administrative centres at village and commune levels have liberated the people and large tracts of territory and as a result have done much to dry up the human  economic and material resources of the enemy. The Khmer soldiers forcibly enlisted by the enemy in order to serve as a pillar of the Phnom Phen regime have become an important force  participating actively with us in the national resistance movement. The irresistible vitality of the national union against the Vietnamese occupation has led to the military impasse into which the Vietnamese forces have been driven for several years  to a point where they are now mainly on the defensive  confined in towns and entrenched along the main lines of communication and in some strategic positions  isolated from oneanother and kept under repeated attacks by our forces. The Vietnamese forces are caught in the guerrilla net of our national resistance and that net keeps tightening upon them year after year. The political and military map of Cambodia has drastically changed in favour of national resistance. ""Foreign observers agree on this. ""The Phnom Penh regime continues to exist thanks only to some 180 000 Vietnamese soldiers and advisers. ""The Vietnamese political and military set-backs in Cambodia have brought about inextricable socio-economic problems in Viet Nam and serious internal conflicts within the Vietnamese leadership. The country whose leader  Ho Chi Minh  gave an assurance that it would be 10 times more beautiful after liberation is today struggling with an annual rate of inflation of 700 per cent  a stagnant production  millions of unemployed  an undernourished population and widespread corruption within the party  the Government and the army. Instead of the promised paradise  the leaders in Hanoi have opened 're-education camps' for political prisoners and created more than a million boat people  who prefer the vicissitudes of exile. They have turned Viet Nam into one of the poorest countries in the world  kept afloat thanks only to Soviet aid. The irony of fate has led Viet Nam  after a long struggle for independence  to become more and more dependent on the Soviet Union  to which  in exchange for the support of its expansionist policy  it has already yielded the strategic military bases of Cam Ranh and Danang. ""Moreover  fear of Cambodia has become widespread among all social strata  as stated by Jean-Claude Pomonti in his article 'Viet Nam; Mend Itself or Sink'  published in Le Monde on 18 June 1987 ""Internal rifts between Vietnamese leaders in their race to occupy the vacant seats of power are no secret to anyone. After the Party Congress we did not know for six months who would take those seats. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs  Nguyen Go Thach  himself a candidate for Prime Minister  told Agence France Presse on 18 June 1987 that 'The election of a new Prime Minister and President of the Council of State has given rise to much debate because of varying opinions on the choice of candidates.""The new Hanoi leaders speak of reforms to alleviate the suffering cruelly afflicting their country and their people  but they continue to be intransigent in their annexationist adventure in Cambodia  which is the main cause of that suffering. Everyone agrees that if they do not end their aggression against and occupation of Cambodia and withdraw all their forces they will never solve their political  social and economic problems and proceed to the development of their country. Such development demands the mobilization of all the country's human and material resources and the creation of the climate of trust necessary for international co-operation.""But  instead of listening to reason in the interest of Viet Nam and its people and of peace  security and stability in South-East Asia  the Vietnamese leaders actively pursue their efforts in the international arena to obtain by tricks and traps what they have been unable to conquer by military force. To attain that un-avowed goal they are trying hard to conceal the root cause of the problem of Cambodia - their invasion and occupation of the country  dismember the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  destroy our national unity and prevent national reconciliation. They are also striving to sow confusion among out friends in the world and weaken  if not eliminate  international support for our struggle.""Indeed  by proposing negotiations on the problem of peace and security in South-East Asia between Viet Nam and the Indo-Chinese countries on the one hand and the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the other  the Vietnamese leaders are attempting to deny the existence of the problem of Cambodia  thus perpetuating their occupation of the country.""By proposing negotiations between the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea of certain components of that Government and the puppet regime in Phnom Penh or certain leaders of that regime  they are attempting to turn the problem of Kampuchea into an internal problem of civil war  thus bringing about the de facto recognition of the regime they have installed in Phnom Penh. Such negotiations would also make null and void the relevant resolutions adopted for eight years in succession by the General Assembly  to  Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea  and our eight-point peace proposal. They would disavow the noble and valuable support for the just cause of the people of Kampuchea and their Coalition Government granted  to date  by 115 states Members of the United Nations. If Viet Nam succeeded in this manoeuvre it would free itself from world condemnation and international isolation  and make the international community accept  de jure if not de facto  its fait accompli in Cambodia  the Indo-China Federation.""To achieve a political solution of the problem of Cambodia it is essential for the Hanoi leaders sincerely to accept reality. There is no way that they can evade the well-known fact that the problem of Cambodia is not a problem of civil war  but rather the result of the invasion and occupation of Kampuchea an independent sovereign State Member of the United Nations  by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  in flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter  the principles of non-alignment and international law. The continuance of that invasion and occupation is the principal threat to peace  security and stability in South-East Asia and Pacific Asia.""The relevant United Nations resolutions on Cambodia and the Declaration of the 1981 International Conference on Kampuchea have set out all the components of and defined the framework for a comprehensive  just and lasting solution. On 17 March 1986 I put forward  on behalf of the Cambodian people and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  an eight-point proposal for a political settlement of the problem of Kampuchea in conformity with those United Nations resolutions and the Declaration. I spoke here last year of that magnanimous proposal. I stress now that to reach a political solution it is indispensable that those now fighting on the battlefield come to the negotiating table. There can be no political solution so long as the Hanoi leaders refuse to negotiate with the representatives of those against whom they are fighting. Their proposals for negotiations are nothing but ruses and diversions to enable them to remain in Cambodia indefinitely. As evidence of our good faith and desire to arrive speedily at a political solution we have  even before the commencement of negotiations  made all the necessary concessions to enable our adversary to withdraw without losing face  in the interest of all: our interest  theirs  the region's and the world's. ""First  we propose that Viet Nam withdraw its forces in two phases  within a definite time-frame and under United Nations supervision. Secondly  even before the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces  we propose that those installed by Viet Nam in Phnom Penh participate in our Coalition Government  which would then become a quadripartite Coalition Government of Kampuchea  thus achieving national reconciliation and enabling all components to have the same rights as political forces. Thirdly  to Viet Naro - which claims that it is threatened by small  weak Cambodia - we offer an independent  united  peaceful  neutral  non-aligned Cambodia  with no foreign bases  with United Nations guarantees and with a United Nations presence. Fourthly  we propose also to Viet Nam that relations be established between our two countries in all fields  including even the signing of a treaty of non-aggression and peaceful coexistence.""What more can we offer  apart from surrender? It is this that the Hanoi leaders actually want to achieve by continuing to reject our proposals and demand that we lay down our weapons and agree to dismember our Coalition Government by eliminating one of its three components or those not to Viet Nam's liking. We must remind those Hanoi leaders of the following points; first  no law of international relations authorises them to interfere in the internal affairs of another State or impose their laws on them secondly  the Cambodian people cannot exercise its right of self-determination and national reconciliation so long as Vietnamese forces are present; thirdly  national reconciliation is not an exclusive process  but is extended to all citizens f the country} and  fourthly  it is a sacred right and a patriotic duty for a] . Cambodians to fight in every way to regain and defend national independence freedom honour and national dignity  as was true of the Vietnamese people in its pre-1975 struggle and of all the peoples of the world in their struggle against warmongers during the two world wars.""So long as Viet Nam refuses to withdraw all its forces from Cambodia  the Cambodian people and its Coalition Government have no choice but to pursue their struggle resolutely and call upon all countries that cherish peace and justice to continue to support that struggle and exert pressure on Viet Nam. If we stray from that path or lack resolve we shall lose for ever our motherland  our freedom and our national identity.""It is for the Hanoi leaders to decide whether they will continue the occupation of Cambodia  in the framework of their policy of an Indo-China Federation and in keeping with their strategy of regional expansion  and maintain their hostility towards the countries of the region and the rest of the world or agree to heed the international community's repeated calls to reason urging them to withdraw all their forces from Cambodia  abandon their expansionist policy  re-establish good relations with all the countries of the region and once again become a part of the family of nations. ""The Soviet Union bears a heavy responsibility in the Vietnamese choice. Indeed  it is the Soviet Union that provides the important and seemingly inexhaustible financial  economic and military means without which Viet Nam could not carry out its policy of 'Indo-China Federation' and regional expansionism. More particularly  Viet Nam could not have invaded and occupied Cambodia up to now without Soviet supplies. It is undeniable that the cessation of Soviet aid would rapidly force Viet Nam to withdraw from Cambodia  for even with that aid Viet Nam has been struggling for nine years already with inextricable and growing difficulties in Cambodia  at home and in the international arena. Unfortunately  the Soviet Union has thus far continued to support Viet Nam's policy of aggression and expansion and has even come to the rescue of Viet Nam so that it can maintain its occupation of Cambodia. The South-East Asian tour of the Soviet Foreign Minister was not designed to seek a political solution to the problem of Kampuchea  but rather was aimed at completing the manoeuvres to split up the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and to ease the international pressure on Viet Nam. So long as the Soviet Union continues to help Viet. Nam to pursue its occupation of Cambodia  it will not convince anyone  especially not the peoples of South-East Asia  of its 'glasnost'  still less of its peaceful intentions and willingness to establish friendly relations with all countries in the region.""Our eight-point peace proposal attests to our sincere willingness to put an end as quickly as possible to the war that is ruining both Cambodia and Viet Nam and proves the importance we attach to the fundamental and long-term interests of our two countries  which are bound to live side by side for all eternity. We are of the opinion that it is time for us to sit at the negotiation table in order to find together a solution to the immediate and long-term problems between our two peoples and nations leaving behind the past which has divided us so much. Once again we declare that the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea is ready to start at any time to embark upon negotiations with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam so as to put an end to the war in Kampuchea  to re-establish normal relations between our two States based on the principles of peaceful coexistence in the interest of our two peoples and countries  as well as those of peace  security and stability in South-East Asia  Pacific Asia and the world at large. It rests only with Viet Nam and the Soviet Union to put an end to the war in Kampuchea and tension in South-East Asia.""Peace and co-operation are not built on words and deceit  but on deeds and sincerity. Viet Nam and the Soviet Union are in a good position to understand that no power  still less a power imposed by foreign forces  however strong  can indefinitely resist the struggle of a people who unite against it and are determined to free themselves  in so far as this struggle is firmly supported by the international community. History has provided sufficient examples showing that it is impossible to suppress a people's freedom for a long time.""This forty-second session of the General Assembly is taking place in a still tense international atmosphere in which  despite an agreement in principle and some encouraging signs  no concrete act has so far been carried out with a view to a balanced and verifiable reduction of nuclear weapons  in which the race for conventional weapons and programmes of armaments modernization are being stepped up  in which local and regional armed conflicts continue to worsen and the problems of under-development  external indebtedness and the food shortages of third world countries are getting worse all the time. ""The International Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development has stressed the correlation between security  disarmament and development to such an extent that it is undeniable that the threat to peace and security is not merely military  but also social and economic  and that there cannot be development without peace. It is the balance to be brought to this correlation that will determine the stability of international relations and the continued improvement of the human condition and peace in today's world  where boundless discoveries of science and technology make interdependence even closer and international co-operation vital for all.""The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  which was successfully concluded with the adoption of the final act  again stressed this interdependence and the need to find an equitable solution to the problem of the indebtedness of developing countries and that of restructuring international economic relations for sustained  sound and balanced economic growth that benefits developed and developing countries alike.""However  those efforts of the international community to preserve international peace and security and to make life on this planet more stable and harmonious are being impeded by the repeated and continued violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter  which were solemnly proclaimed and accepted by all. This violation is the main cause of the breaches of the peace in various parts of the world  and it creates and maintains hotbeds of tension and wars that cause death  suffering and devastation for victims  prevaricators and violators alike.In southern Africa  so long as the Pretoria regime is not compelled to give up its apartheid policy and its illegal occupation of Namibia tension will only increase and the front-line States will continue to be the victims of acts of aggression  subversion and destabilization by that racist regime. The bloody events which are continuously intensifying as a result of the intransigence of that immoral and inhuman regime attest nevertheless to the Irresistible rise of the struggle of the South African black population under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and other political movements and organizations. They also attest to the favourable development of the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) ē They show more than ever before that only implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will lead to a peaceful  just and lasting settlement of the problem of decolonisation of Namibia and that the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist Pretoria regime  followed by a plan of assistance to the front-line States  will bring about the swift eradication of apartheid and hasten the establishment in South Africa of a genuinely democratic and non-racial government  which will result in the restoration of peace  security and stability in the region.""In Chad  in welcoming the recent successes of the brotherly Chadian people and Government  we wish to assure them of our constant fraternal support as they pursue of their noble and just struggle for national reconciliation and recovery of their territorial integrity.""In the Middle East  the efforts aimed at bringing the parties concerned to the negotiating table are being hampered by reciprocal suspicion  denial of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people/ failure to implement the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of foreign territory by force and reluctance in recognizing the right of all States of the region to live and coexist in peace and security. We continue to support and encourage the efforts made by the Arab countries and the Palestinian people to find a just and lasting political solution to the problem of Palestine and the Middle East. We believe that a propitious framework for negotiations could be that of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)   the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.""The tragic and devastating war between Iran and Iraq keeps intensifying and causes the greatest concern to the international community because of the risk of its spilling over to other States of the Persian Gulf  which has become alarming. The longer this painful conflict lasts  the stronger will be the conviction of all that only a peaceful settlement can bring it to an end. We wholeheartedly hope that the mediation efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General  backed by Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  will result in such a settlement.""The chaos and internal strife in Lebanon  which has been going on for more than 10 years  is a source of grief to us all. It is our sincere wish that that country might recover its cohesion and national unity  free from any foreign forces.In Central America  the initiatives of the Contadora Group  with the assistance of the Support Group  deserve the support and encouragement of all. it remains the only regional body promoting a peaceful solution based on respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the States of the region. Its steadfast efforts have caused the peace initiatives of President Arias of Costa Rica to become the Guatemala Agreement  which attests to common desire to restore peace in the region through peaceful means and democracy. In Asia  the unanimous sacred wish of all the Korean people to see their fatherland reunified is far from being realized  despite the commendable efforts made each year by Marshal Kim II Sung  President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  with a view to maximizing the process of an independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean fatherland. It is essential that the two parties - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea - meet to build reciprocal understanding and confidence that could pave the way for a peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation. We are of the opinion that the wise proposal of President Kim II Sung to organize high-level political and military talks between the two parties is a realistic one. We hope that those talks can be held as soon as possible for the good of the Korean nation and people.""In Afghanistan  after nearly eight years of a devastating and an exterminating war  the Soviet Union is more than ever bogged down and has learned to its cost the vanity of its anachronistic ambition. It is time that it realized that the sole  just and lasting solution to the problem does not reside in the slaughter and destruction it is committing in Afghanistan  or in its deceit and manoeuvres  and still less in its bombing of and pressure on Pakistan  but rather in the framework of the relevant United Nations resolutions calling for the immediate and total withdrawal of its forces  so as to enable the Afghan people to exercise freely their inalienable right to self-determination. The sooner it reaches this inevitable conclusion  the quicker it will restore its prestige as a super-Power and the credibility of its rhetoric. We should like to pay tribute to  and reiterate our support for  Pakistan  its Government and its people for their compassion towards the Afghan refugees and also for its steadfastness in not yielding to any intimidation.Last but not least  we wish to reaffirm once again to our neighbours to the north  our brothers and sisters of Laos  out unswerving support for and fraternal solidarity with their just and heroic struggle to free themselves from the same Vietnamese yoke that is also imposed upon us."""
"78",3800,"KNA",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  I wish first of all to thank you for the opportunity afforded me to make my second address to this body. I bring to you and to the distinguished personalities assembled here fraternal greetings from the Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis.May I now join the eminent and eloquent speakers who have preceded me and congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the esteemed position you now occupy. Your election to this post is a clear reflection of the high regard in which you are held and of the complete confidence your colleagues place in you  based  most assuredly  on your personal qualities  diplomatic skills and sincere commitment to the high ideals of the Organization  My delegation pledges its fullest co-operation  in every way possible  with your endeavours to carry out your duties during this  the forty-second session of the General Assembly.I also express congratulations to the previous President of the General Assembly on his capable handling of the critical issues that commanded the attention of this body during the last session and on his skilful guidance of the deliberations. My delegation cannot emphasize too strongly the importance it attaches to the role of the United Nations  in general  and to the General Assembly in particular  in recommending solutions for the peaceful settlement of international political conflicts  for the improvement of international economic conditions  and for the maintenance of human rights and freedom the world over.We firmly believe in the link established between international peace and security and political and socio-economic development. They are not mutually exclusive. They are interdependent and complementary one to the other. We  as citizens of the world community  are committed to redouble our efforts to preserve global freedom and peaceful coexistence of which we here in this body are the sole arbiters.It is a sad reality  however  that our combined efforts to achieve and preserve lasting peace and freedom are constantly thwarted by adverse national and international economic conditions  regional and localized conflicts  and repeated violations of human rights.Indeed  war and the threat of war are issues which constantly demand the attention of the world Organization. However  we are not succeeding in beating the swords raised in anger around the world into ploughshares  as is so clearly set forth as a serious objective by the Organization. Too often we find that the prospect of peace is dangled tantalizingly before a world that is eager for a respite from war - a respite that would give us all an opportunity to build rather than to destroy. Just as often  we find that prospects for peace vanish like a soap-bubble blown into the air.My delegation supports the peace initiative with regard to Iran and Iraq undertaken by the Secretary-General. The world is weary of this seven-year-old war of attrition between Iran and Iraq that has wasted vast amounts of human and natural resources. Recent events in that region clearly demonstrate the risk of the widening of the conflict  and even the possibility of super-Power involvement if the conflict continues  thereby posing а genuine threat to international peace and security.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis fervently supports resolution 598 (1987) unanimously adopted by the Security Council in July of this year  the text of which demands an immediate cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. We call upon both combatants to comply with the resolution  and States members of the General Assembly to be prepared to display the political will to exert the diplomatic pressures required to elicit compliance by the belligerents.Also in the Middle East the question of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a well-defined homeland and to a just and lasting peace is still considered the core of the Middle East conflict. However  this must coexist with the right of the people of Israel to live within secure boundaries. Here  too  strong and persistent action is needed to have all parties adhere to the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on the issue.With respect to the situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  my delegation notes with sad regret that these localized occupations are no closer to an end today despite repeated resolutions that call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from these occupied territories. The hopes and aspirations of the people of Afghanistan and of Kampuchea are being sacrificed in the cauldron of these conflicts. I call upon the General Assembly to continue to register its strong support for the liberation of the people of Afghanistan.The United Nations has a special responsibility to support its Members in their efforts to preserve individual sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence  and to denounce and act against those aggressive nations that violate the fundamental rights of other weaker and vulnerable nations. Those among us who value peace must not be dominated by others who readily resort to war. People everywhere  whether they be in the east or the west  in the north or the south  should be free to choose the government which best reflects their political convictions and aspirations. On the question of peace and stability on the American continent  the situation in Central America preoccupies us. My delegation is particularly concerned about the possible implications for the peoples of Central America  Latin America  and the Caribbean that a worsening of the crisis in this area may have. The Caribbean and Latin America need an economic revival  but this revival cannot come in the midst of civil wars and guerrilla activity.My delegation welcomes the peace initiative recently worked out by Government leaders of Central America. It is a peace plan by Central Americans for Central America. It should be given every opportunity to be effective. I call upon all combatants throughout Central America and the Caribbean to observe the cease-fire and then to negotiate in good faith for a lasting peace leading to the realization of true democracy throughout the region.Also in relation to our partner in the Caribbean Community  Belize  my delegation calls for early ratification of the Cartagena Protocol as a contribution to the lowering of tensions in the region. The fact is that the various conflicts throughout the world are being supplied with arms from seemingly inexhaustible sources. This fact  however  receives scant attention from the international community.Our attention is focused instead on the prospects for an arms reduction agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union  mainly in relation to medium-range nuclear missiles. There is great concern about the danger of nuclear weapons  and this is certainly justified because no corner of the world can be considered safe from the fallout of nuclear explosion. While  however  we seek to prevent this potential calamity  the reality is that every day all over the world destruction of life and property is being wrought by conventional weapons. It is imperative that our forum here at the United Nations spearhead urgent and continuing efforts to achieve genuine and meaningful progress in disarmament to include all weapons  conventional and chemical  as well as nuclear. It is then and only then that we will be able to mobilize fully the resources of rich and poor nations alike to address the serious economic problems which obstruct our attempts at achieving a better quality of life for all.Article 55 of the Charter of the United Nations recognizes that conditions of stability and well-being are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations. In turn  peace and friendly relations among nations are necessary prerequisites to the achievement of steady economic growth worldwide.The world debt problem is yet another deterrent to economic development. It runs counter to the efforts of this body to alleviate the syndrome of poverty and underdevelopment crippling half of the world's population as it currently bedevils all attempts by the developing countries to bring a better quality of life to their people. I share the sentiment that a concrete solution can only be envisioned if the issue is treated as the international crisis that it is.The Assembly has had to concede that the International Development Strategy for the First and Second United Nations Development Decades has remained largely unfulfilled. As we approach the end of the Third Development Decade  the developing countries do not deny the existence of their external debt  nor shun a measure of responsibility for its solution. We realize that the primary responsibility for improving our economies rests upon our shoulders. However  we cannot go it alone in this world where even the super-Powers recognize some level of interdependence- We are buffeted by changing conditions in the world at large  and are at the mercy of conditions over which we have no control. The debt problem can only be addressed in a meaningful way by a process of Worth-South co-operation. My delegation is highly supportive of the approach to this problem outlined here by the Government of Jamaica. This proposal calls for a longer-term structured rescheduling of debt  accompanied by the provision of additional capital resources  so that economic growth is not stultified by the burden of debt servicing  but rather continues in tandem with it.The more affluent countries cannot  nor should they try  to shirk their  responsibility to increase the capital resources available to the developing nations.It is the developed countries which reduce the price that they pay to us for the primary commodities we produce- It is the developed countries which increase the price of the machinery and equipment they sell to us to De used in the production of the same primary commodities  and in other vital development areas.This is the situation in which Saint Kitts and Nevis is placed in relation to its primary export commodity  sugar. The price is severely depressed. Quotas are drastically reduced. But the price of machinery to improve the efficiency of production continues to escalate. The plight of the sugar-producing countries in the Caribbean  and indeed throughout the world  cannot be addressed by platitudes or the current attitude of benign neglect. It requires the urgent serious and sympathetic consideration of the developed countries.It is clear that economic strangulation can and does lead to political instability within and between nations. Many countries find it increasingly difficult to cope with growing social and economic demands in the face of drastic adjustments. Our vigorous efforts need to be complemented by increased international assistance and co-operation. It is not enough to call for structural adjustment. This is not by itself the universal panacea. Indeed  this is already being undertaken in many developing countries. In my own country Saint Kitts and Nevis  we have already embarked on a programme of diversification which expands our agricultural sector  places greater emphasis on tourism development and gives impetus to the growth of light industry  while at the same time employing greater fiscal prudence in the public sector.It is unfortunate that some - I repeat  some - experts from the developed countries have a biased view of structural adjustment. Their interpretation in relation to the developing countries is: increasing taxation on already overburdened people} reducing programmes for social and cultural developments; and cutting back on provision of employment by the public sector.For the developed countries  however  their interpretation of structural adjustment can include: reducing taxes; increasing spending on implements or war; and reducing assistance to developing countries in the grip of structural adjustment.This approach will only further increase the imbalances which exist and widen the gap between the rich and the poor countries. In the final analysis  all of us need to realize that there must be a humane side to structural adjustment. The fiscal and economic measures which are employed nationally  regionally and internationally to improve the abstract indices of growth and development must also address the educational  social  cultural and health needs of people everywhere. The real essence of development is the development of people.The world has risen to many a challenge in the past to provide a better quality of life for people everywhere  and the United Nations has been in the forefront of the struggle. Diseases once the scourge of mankind  like smallpox  tuberculosis and poliomyelitis  have been defeated. Once again we must mobilize; we must defeat malnutrition  poverty  drug abuse and the more recent scourge. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome  AIDS  which threaten to destroy the flower of our youth who hold the keys to the future of our nations. The time has come for us to take a more humanitarian look at the world  and to divert more of its resources away from creating and proliferating the means of destruction into providing constructive and effective solutions to the problems of underdevelopment. I have so far projected a general view of developing countries. However  it has come to be universally recognized that there is within this broad framework a special category of developing countries whose problems require special consideration. This is the category of island developing countries.A number of analytical and descriptive studies  including a study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  have shown that island developing countries have characteristics distinct from those of developing countries in general. As a result  the type of development strategy regarded as appropriate in general and promoted by the United Nations may in some aspects be inappropriate for these countries in particular. The studies have also highlighted certain specific handicaps facing small island countries and dispelled some myths concerning them.Our handicaps are basically derived from the smallness and remoteness of most of us. They include vulnerability to natural disasters  such as hurricanes  to which islands in the Caribbean are particularly vulnerable; special transport problems  which are even more acute in archipelagic countries; highly limited internal markets; lack of natural resources; and heavy dependence on imports.These imports in turn ate financed by a small number of foreign-exchange-earning activities - commodity exports  tourism or emigrant remittances  for example. Given the high per capita cost of building and maintaining the economic and social infrastructure for small and isolated populations  small islands lack the critical mass to provide basic services economically for their populations. However  these services must be provided. People in island communities have as much right to life  liberty  the pursuit of happiness and basic amenities as people in large metropolitan societies. Growing recognition of the conclusions regarding island developing countries is reflected in the five resolutions on island developing countries adopted unanimously by the General Assembly between 1976 and 1982. The international development strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade specifically highlights our problems. Other organizations have also begun to focus on this group. For instance  the Commonwealth Heads of Government endorsed  in 1979  a special programme of action in favour of the smaller Commonwealth countries  and the Lomé Conventions make special provisions for these countries.However  a number of countries and institutions are clearly sceptical about the specificity of island developing countries  and some are against the proliferation of such special categories of developing countries.I say to the sceptics that the existence of sovereign island nations is a fact of life. We are real  we exist  we have a voice which is heard and must continue to be heard in international forums  and we are sovereign. We are no figment of anyone's imagination. We are here  and here to stay. I therefore call for urgent  concerted and constructive action to give effect to the resolutions in relation to island developing countries already adopted by the Assembly.The effective functioning of the United Nations in its various dimensions is vital to the resolution of conflicts  the achievement of peace in the world  and the marshalling of the resources of the world for the effective resolution of problems. Here we can come together to heal wounds and facilitate co-operation between nations.It is in this context that we renew our call for North and South Korea to become Members of the United Nations This is not to deny or preclude the goal of reunification of the Korean peninsula. We must  however  address situations as they exist  and not merely as we would wish them to be. Both countries on the Korean peninsula amply satisfy the requirements for membership. Besides  the realities of the existing deadlock dictate the need for the stimulation and maintenance of dialogue between the two sides within such a structured and supportive framework as the United Nations can provide.Finally  I turn to the question of human rights  the violation of which is another threat to international peace and security.Developing countries like Saint Kitts and Nevis are acutely aware of the premium which must be placed on human resources. Our greatest potential lies in our people  and in drawing from them the qualities of patriotism and service which can flourish only in an atmosphere which guarantees the dignity and worth of the human person. Yet  nearly 40 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the right of peoples and nations to self-determination as a prerequisite to the full enjoyment of all fundamental human rights is still being denied.Nowhere is such violation more flagrant and agonizing than in South Africa  where the evil policy of apartheid is insensitively perpetuated and consolidated. The United Nations has been in the forefront of the opposition to apartheid  and now appears to be growing weary in its efforts to bring an end to its perpetuation. Perhaps this is the design; perhaps the design of Pretoria is continually to confront the international community with arrogant defiance and frustrate it into wearied resignation and silence.My delegation refuses to be lulled into silence on this issue. We will take every opportunity publicly to proclaim our abhorrence for the system of apartheid  because it is inherently evil  and we exhort the international community and the oppressed of South Africa to stand firm in their opposition and struggle. We laud all the countries that have heeded the appeals of the various resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council and have imposed sanctions on South Africa. We are optimistic that if a persevering world unified against apartheid continues to send this signal to Pretoria the stubborn walls of apartheid must eventually crumble. We can accept nothing less than the equality of all men. St. Kitts and Nevis also reaffirms its support for Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the United Nations independence plan for Namibia. The world is so closely knit and interdependent that conflicts or tensions anywhere and of whatever nature affect us all  because we are citizens of one world. We are our brother's keeper  and as brothers we are equal. The United Nations is like a great lens which is made to capture the powerful but diffuse rays of the sun and distil and concentrate them into a unified force directed into any selected focal point. The United Nations can and should attract the diverse energies  resources and creativity of all the nations and concentrate them into a unified powerful force to be focused upon the various problems that beset mankind. I am convinced that in this way effective solutions compatible with the preservation of human dignity can be achieved."
"79",3872,"KWT",42,1987,"﻿I have pleasure in extending to Mr  Peter Florin my sincerest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is particularly gratifying in that he is a representative of the German Democratic Republic  to which my country  Kuwait  is tied by the strongest bonds and mutual interests. I am confident that his experience and wisdom will lead this session to success and positive results.I also wish to express our appreciation of the efforts of his predecessor as President  our colleague Mr  Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  the Foreign Minister of friendly Bangladesh  during the forty-first session.I must also praise the strenuous efforts exerted by the Secretary-General  Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar  in dealing with the various international issues to which he sincerely and resolutely seeks appropriate solutions while highlighting the significance of the role of the United Nations in achieving and maintaining international peace and security. We the Member States of the United Nations must spare no effort in helping him not only to uphold the Organization and its important role in the world  but also to enhance that role with a view to ensuring the better future we desire for ourselves and coming generations.The present and future of the United Nations depend on the uninterrupted and unconditional flow of material and moral support from the Member States. Of primary importance are political support  the honouring of pledges and total commitment to the obligations and responsibilities defined in the Charter and in resolutions. In the absence of a true commitment to the implementation of the Organization's resolutions  which spell out the will of the international community  our Organization would be no more than a rostrum for people who cry out and give utterance to wishes in words which ate promptly dispersed by the wind or submerged in adverse facts  leaving behind cries that undermine the prospects of peace and human well-being and progress.The Prince of the State of Kuwait# His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah  spoke of this in a recent statement as follows: ""The United Nations is the world's conscience and executive power. The conscience is in the General Assembly and the power is wielded by the Security Council. Of the latter body the world expects mandatory resolutions which reaffirm its unshakable desire for a solution to the crises that threaten international peace and security.""Kuwait  which urged and supported the consolidation of United Nations processes last year  believes that it is the duty of all Member States to honour their financial obligations as defined in the Charter to ensure the proper performance by the United Nations of its historic role in the service of world peace.The leaders of the Muslim nation bestowed upon Kuwait the honour and responsibility of presiding over the fifth summit Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in Kuwait. His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah will.' head the Organization for the next three years. At their Conference in Kuwait  the leaders of the Muslim nation discussed the political and economic challenges facing the world  and the Islamic world in particular. That summit Conference adopted a set of resolutions on regional and international issues. His Highness the Chairman of the Conference pledged tooversee the implementation of those resolutions so that  God willing  they may bear fruit.The leaders of the Muslim nation accorded the highest priority in their deliberations and resolutions to the question of holy Jerusalem - Al-Quds-al-Sharif - the cradle of religions and civilizations. That was hardly surprising; such priority flows from the basic objective of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. It constitutes the fulfilment  recognition and discharge by the Conference of its religious obligation towards the Holy City. The leaders therefore reaffirmed the imperative necessity of preserving its Islamic and Arab character and reiterated that all Zionist legislation concerning Jerusalem are null and void.The overriding concern of the leaders of the Muslim nations in their Kuwait meeting was the Iraq-Iran war  which this month entered its eighth year. This is a war between two principal members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. It was regrettable that Iran saw fit to boycott that important meeting  under false pretexts  and that it mounted an unjust propaganda campaign against the meeting and the State of Kuwait  despite the considerable efforts made by Kuwait  the host  country  and by the leaders of the other Muslim countries  to persuade officials in Iran of the necessity and usefulness of participating in the meeting to present and defend their views and listen to the views of others. But Iran has been adamant in its boycott of the meeting and rejection of its outcome and unanimous resolutions  which were a sincere  conscious contribution to the quest for a quick and just end to that war .The Conference's resolution on the war stemmed from and was inspired by the teachings of true Islam. It was an expression of the leaders' resolve to fulfil their duties towards two Muslim neighbours. It showed an awareness by the leaders of their historical and religious responsibility to preserve the unity and coherence of the Muslim nation and their desire to avoid further shedding of Muslim blood in vain. The resolution was aimed at upholding the right of the peoples of the two countries to enjoy their wealth and resources in peace  security and stability  and the right of the countries and peoples of the region to protect themselves from the dire consequences of the continuation and expansion of the war By contrast  Iran's policy has been to exacerbate matters and to push the war towards perilous extremes. The flames of that war have started to engulf other countries not parties to the conflict  thereby seriously setting back the international economy. International security and freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf have been obstructed and jeopardized by strikes at ships from countries not parties to the conflict. The Arabian Gulf has always been a bridge of love for nations of the region  an oasis of co-operation  security and peace  and a source of well-being for the world. We have to preserve its distinct character} that is our collective responsibility  we the countries of the region.This war erupted  we in Kuwait have been aware of its dangers and have sensed in it and in its undercurrents and developments the potential for expansion. Our preoccupation with the necessity for peace  neighbourliness and the tenets and ties of Islam  prompted us to initiate contacts  both on our own and collectively contacts with other States in the Gulf Co-operation Council  and other regional and international organizations  through the League of Arab states  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations  in an attempt to bring this war to a prompt and just end. Subsequently  we tried to persuade the leaders of Iran to opt for peace - just as our brothers in Iraq had done - to heed the international will as reflected in numerous resolutions and initiatives.But the Government of Iran rejected all those sincere calls  initiatives and resolutions. It erroneously and arbitrarily interpreted Kuwait's actions and endeavours to achieve this noble aim and thereby set out to target us - though we have never been a party to the conflict. Since 1984  Iran has been striking at our tankers in the waters of the Arabian Gulf. We have exercised the utmost self-restraint in the face of those provocations and assaults. We have no wish to see them intensify and expand. We have sought an end to them and have had recourse to international legitimacy as embodied in the Security Council  with a view to halting the attacks and safeguarding the interests of countries not parties to the conflict Nevertheless  the leaders in Iran are determined to continue to deprive us of the secure flow of our oil exports  thereby undermining our ability to meet our domestic and international obligations and play our role as contributors to the economic development programmes of developing countries. Paced with such a posture  we had to make certain normal and habitual commercial arrangements - arrangements previously made by many other countries  including Iran itself to ensure safe passage to our tankers.Iran raised an unjustified commotion about those commercial measures  this was a ruse by Iran to divert attention from its policies and practices directed against us. This Iranian posture is one of the most ominous aspects of the escalation currently witnessed by our region. In formulating its foreign policy  Kuwait has always held that  the security of the Gulf region is the exclusive responsibility of the countries of the region. That strategically important region supplies the world with a valuable  indeed indispensable  resource and makes a considerable contribution to the development and well being of the world. The region must therefore remain free of tensions and crises if major-Power rivalry and sinister foreign interventions are to be avoided  the use or threat of the use of force should have no place in the region.Iran's determination to continue the war  its expansion of the hostilities  its threats to and bombing of ships of countries not parties to the conflict  its mining of waters throughout the Gulf  have brought matters to their present  state  turned the Arabian Gulf into a highly volatile tinder box and led to the presence of foreign fleets and warships  each seeking to protect interests and freedom of navigation in that international waterway. It has now become clear  particularly through developments over the past few weeks  that Iran is determined to infringe upon our sovereignty and territorial integrity by all means. Residential and industrial areas in some parts of Kuwait  as well as its islands  have come under attack by Iranian missiles in overt acts of aggression that have no purpose but expanding of this war  further fanning its flames and increasing the number of its victims.Moreover  the inviolability of our embassy in Teheran was breached  its members were detained and mistreated  its contents were ransacked and burned and the embassy was  and still is  occupied in violation of the most basic rules of international law and norms of diplomatic behaviour. The tragic incident in Holy Mecca during one of God's holiest and more glorious days bears witness to Iranian irresponsibility. From this rostrum we call upon Iran to desist from such practices and to respect the rules and laws that govern relations between countries and ensure good-neighbourliness  in the interests of the region.Good-neighbourliness can never be achieved through aggression and provocation.Only through co-operation  cohesion and fraternity can people live as good neighbours.There is not a single war in contemporary history that has lasted as long as this one or has wrought as much destruction. There has never been so much effort  on the regional  international  individual and collective levels - as that which has been directed at putting an end to this war. The latest in the series of international efforts has been Security Council resolution 598 (1987). This has been a historic resolution indeed in terms of the very fact that it has been adopted  the balance  fairness and unanimity which have characterized it and the popular support and official enthusiasm it has generated.We now find that this resolution could well be the last chance to secure a just and lasting peace between the two Muslim neighbours and ensure peace in the region. The responsibility for pressing ahead towards the implementation of the resolution is shared by all. History will judge us mercilessly should we fail to make the effort and exert the pressure that will ensure implementation. Interests among countries have become so shared and interlocked that there are no longer any limited conflicts that affect only those who are party to is. Therefore  we are all partners in good and evil  as well as in war and in peace. So let us all work together for peace  and while hailing Iraq's acceptance of this resolution  let us call upon Iran to accept it fully and unambiguously and implement it without delay so that the curtain may fall on the last act of this tragedy which is at odds with heaven's values  let alone earth's laws. While we fully appreciate the unremitting efforts of the Secretary-General to implement the said resolution  especially his recent trip to both Tehran and Baghdad  we believe that we are all in duty-bound to support fully his endeavour without falling into the snares of deception or chasing a mirage.The Palestinian question was at the forefront of the agenda and attracted the attention of leaders of the Muslim nation during their meeting at Kuwait. In-depth and detailed consideration was given to the current statement; the continued suffering of the Palestinian people under the sway and oppression of the Israeli occupation forces; the continued occupation of the Arab territories  most notably Holy al-Quds  and the preventing of the Palestinian people from establishing their independent State on their national soil  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation organization (PLO).The leaders' resolutions expressed the unity of purpose and the awareness of a common destiny with regard to this sacred cause. The leaders found that moving the issue along the path of a solution will be achieved only through an international conference held under the auspices of the United Nations and attended by all parties on an equal footing  including the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.We in Kuwait have always considered and will continue to consider the Palestinian cause as our principal concern. It is a cause that involves our dignity and credibility as Arabs. Thus  while thanking the countries and regional organizations that have supported the convening of the international conference  we ask those countries that wield decisive influence over Israel to join the mainstream of the overwhelming international majority and pressure Israel in to ensuring the holding of that conference  whose purpose is to establish peace in the Middle East region and secure the Palestinian people's right of return to their homeland from the torment of homelessness and ruin.Since the brutal Israeli invasion of its territory five years ago  Lebanon continues to see parts of its native soil in the South languishing under the heel of Israeli military occupation. Despite numerous resolutions by the Security Council demanding Israeli withdrawal  Israel continues to refuse to withdraw in pursuance of its policy of expansion at the expense of others  interference in Lebanon's domestic affairs  undermining its security and destabilizing its independence. The world community must force Israel to withdraw from all Lebanese territory. We are also required to stand firmly by Lebanon and support the steadfastness of its people in order to ensure Lebanon's independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and the security of its people and institutions.The situation in Afghanistan continues to be a source of great concern to Kuwait. That question was taken up by leaders of the Muslim nation in Kuwait.They have demanded the withdrawal of foreign forces and supported ongoing efforts by the United Nations to reach a just solution to this issue  securing the return to their homes of all Afghan refugees  non-intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and the preservation of its Islamic and non-aligned character.We in Kuwait welcome the constructive efforts of the Secretary-General  through his Special Representative  and hope that the negotiating parties may show sufficient flexibility in their endeavours to reach a solution that ensures the region's safety and security. With the same attention and sense of historic responsibility accorded to the study of Zionism and Israel's continued occupation of Arab territories  the Muslim leaders in Kuwait discussed the question of racism  the persistent occupation of Namibia and South Africa's repeated attacks against its neighbours  the front-line States. They found that a comprehensive and sincere boycott of the racist regime in South Africa is the only means of forcing it to respond to the will of the international community and respect the rights of the black majority  primary among which is their right to be treated as equals.Kuwait has always supported the legitimate and courageous struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)   and believes that it is no longer permissible or fair to let Security Council resolution 435 (1978) be held hostage to elements extraneous to that resolution and detrimental to the achievement its legitimate objectives  namely peace and security in the region.On the basis of its commitment to support international and regional efforts towards a peaceful solution of political problems  Kuwait views with satisfaction the signs of agreement among Central American countries in the development of well-thought-out and approved bases for solving the political problems of that region in a manner that precludes super-Power intervention and manipulation of situations to serve their own ends. We support the aspirations of the region's nations to an environment of tranquillity and stability wherein the national energies may be focused' on development  reconstruction and the achievement of human well-being.Among the primary concerns of the Muslim nation's leaders during their meeting in Kuwait was the issue of terrorism - the phenomenon that has spread in our world today to the extent that it now threatens the very foundations of world stability. The leaders expressed their concern and dismay at the alarming proportions which that phenomenon had now reached and declared their utter rejection of the tendentious attempts by anti-Islam forces to link terrorism to Islam.Both in essence and substance  Islam rejects violence in whatever shape or form because it is a faith based on affection and fraternity and depends  in precepts and practice  on dialogue and persuasion. The Muslim nation is willing to co-operate among its members and with the world community to eradicate international terrorism and highlight the differences between terrorism and the sacred right of peoples to wage a legitimate liberation struggle. To that end  the leaders supported the convening of an international conference under United Nations auspices to draft a definition of terrorism.Whenever signs of concord in the relations between the two super-Powers appear on the horizon  their positive effects are reflected on the peace and security of the whole world. In that connection  Kuwait welcomes the tentative agreement reached between the United States of America and the Soviet Union on eliminating their medium-range missiles and nuclear warheads  and hopes that that will be the beginning of an ongoing process that leads to disarmament.Announcement of that understanding gave peace-loving peoples hope for the dawning of a new era in which co-operation will prevail among the world's major Powers instead of the rivalry which has squandered huge resources and diverted them away from their real functions of serving mankind and upholding peace. In the interests of peace  we call upon the super-Powers to give regional wars and conflicts the same attention they have accorded to their unresolved bilateral issues. We in Kuwait believe that preserving the lives of people  wherever they may be  must be our goal  because man is the maker of peace and progress and the generator of their motive power.In the turmoil of the political situation of today's world  the Islamic Summit Conference was held and concluded its work under the shadow of critical international economic conditions. The leaders discussed those problems thoroughly in the light of their commitment to the right of Muslim and other nations of the world to a secure and stable life  economic development and social well-being.Throughout  the participants in the Conference were able to steer  with God's help  the ship of the Islamic Conference clear of storms and rocks towards a new horizon where Muslims' blood is spared and their ranks closed  while basking in brotherhood  co-operation and peace.We confidently hope that the United Nations - the living model of international co-operation - will benefit from the success of the Islamic Summit Conference  to which my country  Kuwait  served as host."
"80",3918,"LAO",42,1987,"﻿The delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic would like at the outset to congratulate Ambassador Peter Florin on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the present session. In choosing him for that post the international community has paid a tribute both to his excellent qualities as a diplomat and to the tireless efforts of his country  the German Democratic Republic  for peace and disarmament in Europe and throughout the world. My delegation is convinced that under his wise and able guidance the work of this session will be successful.The Lao delegation wishes also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless and innovative efforts to strengthen regional and international peace and security and to promote and revitalize international economic co-operation for development.This session is of great significance for us since it coincides with the seventieth anniversary of the great October revolution  which opened a new era in the history of mankind  an era which has created conditions conducive to the national liberation struggle  enabling many peoples to free themselves from colonialism  to attain independence and sovereignty and to become full-fledged members of the community of nations.The international climate and environment in which this session is taking place  if not better than at the last session  are none the less characterized by the optimism aroused by the agreement in principle reached recently by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union and the Secretary of State of the United States of America on the total elimination of those countries' medium-range and short-range nuclear missiles. The conclusion of such a bilateral agreement would be a very important initial measure of arms reduction and nuclear disarmament. The enthusiasm with which all mankind has welcomed this positive event is all the more understandable since the unbridled arms race - in particular  the nuclear-arms race - not only damages its well-being but also jeopardizes its very survival. №at is a fact that can be a secret to no one.The Lao Government reiterates its condemnation of any military doctrine seeking security not through disarmament but through military and strategic superiority and nuclear deterrence. Such doctrines ignore the realities of the present-day world  which has become increasingly interdependent and in which  in this nuclear and space age  security can only be global and equal for all countries and peoples  irrespective of their size  their social and economic system and their level of development. It is therefore vital that the international community contribute actively to the development and establishment of a general system of international peace and security encompassing the political  military  economic  humanitarian and ecological fields.The Lao Government is pleased at the positive results achieved by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which was held here less than a month ago. The arms race must come to an end on earth and everything possible must be done to prevent its spread to outer space if we want considerable resources to be released and then reallocated to the economic and social development of all peoples  in particular the peoples of the developing countries.The Lao People's Democratic Republic wishes in that context to reaffirm its support for all the peace and disarmament initiatives put forward to date by the socialist countries  among them the general programme of security for disarmament adopted last January by the Soviet Union with a view to ridding the world of nuclear weapons and all types of weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000. Many peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America still confront the disastrous consequences of tension and conflict caused by the interventionist and aggressive policies of imperialism  colonialism  racism  apartheid and Zionism.In southern Africa  the racist regime of Pretoria pursues with impunity its policy of oppression and repression of the black majority population  as well as its acts of aggression against the front-line countries. It is perpetuating its illegal occupation of Namibia and committing barbaric acts of repression against the Namibian people. The Lao Government reaffirms its unswerving support for the struggle of the South African people  under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa  for the recovery of their basic human rights and for that of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  its sole authentic representative  in its heroic struggle for self-determination and national independence. It condemns the policy of so-called constructive engagement and that of linkage  which would bind the independence of Namibia to an unrelated issue; the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist troops from Angola. Namibia cannot attain its independence outside the context of the conditions set out in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The Lao Government reiterates its firm support for the front-line States in their persistent struggle to safeguard their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.In the Middle East  the situation remains tense. Settlement of the Middle East crisis  at the heart of which is the question of Palestine  cannot be achieved without the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem. It is regrettable that Washington and Tel Aviv still oppose the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the Soviet Union  the United States and all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The Lao People's Democratic Republic will always unswervingly support the Palestinian people which  under the resolute guidance of the FLO  its sole and authentic representative  is waging a heroic struggle against the Zionist aggressor and occupier for the recovery and exercise of its inalienable rights  including the right to establish its own state in Palestine.In connection with the Iran-Iraq conflict  the Lao Government welcomes the adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)   inviting those two countries to put an immediate end to their devastating hostilities and to begin negotiations with a view to finding a solution that is just and acceptable to the  two parties. The international community has for some days now been witnessing an aggravation of the situation in the Persian Gulf. The tragic incident that occurred last week is a sad reminder of the incident in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964.The peoples of Central America have long aspired to live in peace and harmony  in friendship and mutual co-operation.As regards Nicaragua  tranquillity can be restored only if the Government of the United States of America puts an end to all acts of aggression and destabilization  and ceases opposing the peace process promoted by the Contadora Group and supported by the Lima Group and made explicit in the peace plan adopted by the Heads of State of the five countries of Central America last August in Guatemala.Panama  whose people has fought unceasingly to preserve its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  is also a victim of interference in its internal affairs by the imperialist powers. We continue to support its struggle and the struggles of the other peoples of the region for self-determination  independence and genuine democracy in their respective countries.The region of south-west Asia has not yet experienced genuine peace. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan remains the victim of an undeclared war waged by the aggressive circles of imperialism and regional and international reactionary forces. We support the Geneva process of indirect negotiations and firmly support the programme of national reconciliation which the Afghan Government adopted at the beginning of this year. If implemented in good faith by all the parties concerned  that programme would make a decisive contribution to a political  comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the situation surrounding that country. The international community is still witnessing the tension that prevails in the region of the Indian Ocean due to the intensification of activities at the Diego-Garcia air and naval base and the strengthening of the imperialist military presence there. It is highly desirable that the international conference on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  delayed once again because of the hostile attitude of certain countries  be convened no later than 1990. The situation in Asia and the Pacific also is one of increased tension because of the neo-globalist policy pursued by an imperialist super-Power  which has resulted in the concentration of troops and nuclear arsenals in South Korea and certain other countries of the region. In addition to posing a threat to the peace and security of the peoples of the region  the situation of course jeopardizes their legitimate aspirations to co-operation and well-being.The Lao Government associates itself with the efforts of the international community to transform the Asia-Pacific region into a nuclear weapon-free zone. In this context  it reaffirms its support for the proposals made by Comrade Mikhail Gorbachev  the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  at Vladivostok in July 1986  for the recent proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for progressive disarmament in the two parts of Korea  and also for the Rarotonga Declaration.The peoples of South-East Asia  like those of other parts of the world  have long fervently aspired to a happy and prosperous existence free of conflicts and tension. But unfortunately the aggressive forces of imperialism and international and regional reaction have done all in their power to prevent realization of those noble aspirations. It is a secret to no one that Laos  Viet Nam and Kampuchea have worked sincerely for peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia and to make the area a nuclear weapon-free zone. They therefore reaffirm all the constructive and realistic proposals they have thus far put forward toward that The situation surrounding my country has not yet been one of genuine peace# in spite of the efforts that the Lao Government has made to achieve that end. The two rounds of negotiations held in past months in Vientiane and Bangkok to resolve the question of the sovereignty of the three Lao villages - an issue which the United Nations Security Council considered in 1984 - did not provide any final solutions. Worse still  last August other border incidents occurred in the same region and for the same reasons  thus making the situation at the Lao-Thai border even more tense. The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic expresses its deep concern at this situation and  with a view to the restoration of good-neighbourly relations as soon as possible  appeals to the Government of Thailand to show its goodwill by deciding as soon as possible to resume negotiations with the Lao side  as we have proposed.The Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea has firmly pursued its noble cause of national renewal and rehabilitation. The successes that it has won in this long-standing endeavour have been significant. Hence  taking the foregoing into account and moved by a spirit of exemplary generosity  the Phnom Penh Government recently made a public declaration on its policy of national reconciliation  in which all Kampucheans - with the exception of Pol Pot and his close collaborators - without any discrimination whatsoever based on ethnic or social origin  political opinion or religious belief  are invited to Unite for the building of a progressive  egalitarian and just society in an independent  peaceful and non-aligned Kampuchea  enjoying friendly relations with all countries  in particular its neighbours.In this spirit  the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea have agreed to carry out in the very near future another partial withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteer troops from Kampuchea  an operation which representatives of a certain number of Governments  eminent personalities and the mass media will be invited to attend as observers. This policy  which is in line with the general trends of our day and the needs of all Kampucheans who want to see their homeland prosper  deserves the active support of the international community.It is regrettable that certain countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) persist in supporting the so-called Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea with its eight-point proposal  knowing full well that that is an unnatural alliance. Internal contradictions  conflicts of interest and squabbles  which are a constant feature of that heterogeneous Coalition  have meant that the latter is at present devoid of leadership. Therefore that Government is nothing but a fiction kept alive by certain countries and circles to serve their own interests by bringing about a return to power in Kampuchea of the genocidal Pol Pot clique. It is time for the leaders of those countries and circles to agree to face the facts and respect  first and foremost  the agreement signed in Ho Chi Minh City in July 1987 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  representing the ASEAN countries  and his Vietnamese counterpart  representing the countries of Indo-China.Peace and security are meaningful for a people only if accompanied by tangible guarantees of well-being; hence the capital importance that the international community attaches to the economic aspect of security. It must be noted with regret that in this respect the gap between the rich and the poor countries has only widened  and this is due solely to the fact that the developed market economy countries are still refusing to renounce their selfish interests. Has the time not come for them to rethink their short-sighted policy and join in the efforts of the international community to find an effective remedy to the present world economic crisis  from whose harsh impact they  too  suffer? In this spirit we recognize that the reasonably positive results of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held last July in Geneva  should temper our pessimism. We are pleased with the harmonious development of relations between our country and essential United Nations agencies entrusted with international co-operation for development. In this regard we pay tribute to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)# whose role as a catalyst made possible the success of the Second Round-Table Conference# held under its sponsorship in April of last year.My country pays tribute to the fervour and dedication with which the United Nations is endeavouring to accomplish its noble task of maintaining and strengthening international peace and security and guaranteeing to all peoples on earth a future of well-being  freedom  justice  equality and prosperity  All those ideals are doomed to failure if we do not participate resolutely and sincerely in the crusade against the socio-economic  political and other ills afflicting the majority of the world's population. Those ills are: poverty; hunger; disease; illiteracy; imperialist; colonialist and Zionist aggression; apartheid; economic plundering; and so on· The elimination of those military and non-military threats to the security of peoples is imperative if we are to fashion progressively a world free of violence and nuclear weapons· New ways of thinking and political reflection - in a word  a new vision of the world - should also be adopted by all the States of the world.It is in that spirit that the Lao Government undertakes to join in the international community's efforts to create conditions conducive to the building of such a world. The Lao delegation hopes that this guiding principle will be given the attention it deserves at this session."
"81",3962,"LBN",42,1987,"﻿I should like first to thank all the speakers who have  from this rostrum  expressed their concern over and commitment to Lebanon. 1 hope that this heightened attention on the part of our friends in the world community will be a harbinger of a new resolve to reverse the course of war and destruction in our land.Mr. President  allow me to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your election is a recognition by the world community of your personal qualities and of the role your country plays in world affairs. I wish you success in your new responsibilities.I also take this opportunity to thank your predecessor for the leadership role he played in the past year and for the achievements of the General Assembly und r his presidency.The Lebanese delegation has studied with great interest the comprehensive annual report submitted by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His analysis of the state of the world  and particularly of the Middle East  deserves the recognition of all who are concerned with the fate of peace. I wish also express special thanks to the Secretary-General and to his able assistants for their continued efforts to implement the Security Council resolutions on Lebanon. The performance of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the commitment of the contributing countries are of the utmost importance for peace in Lebanon and for international security in the whole Middle East.This is my third appearance before the General Assembly. Five years ago  a month after my election as President of Lebanon  I came here with ""a message of confidence"" (A/37/PV.35  p. 2-5). I was hoping that my country would be allowed to engage in what I then described as a ""daring adventure of peace and reconstruction4 (A/3 7/PV. 35f p. 2-5). After so many years of war  I then felt I could tell the General Assembly  on behalf of all Lebanese United as we were in a ""sharpened national consensus"" (A/37/FV.35  p. 2-5)  of our determination to end the bloodshed  destruction  and despair that wracked our country. Today  I stand here to admit  with candour and sorrow  that our dedication to the cause of peace was  alas  frustrated by superior forces. The Lebanese authorities were overpowered by an ugly war which caused more innocent victims among the civilian population than in the ranks of fighters.For centuries past Lebanon had been the example of peaceful coexistence between religions  races and cultures which formed a pluralistic  yet harmonious  society devoted to the ideals of liberty and peace. Caught in the cycle of violence that engulfs the Middle East  we ask ourselves today whether those who set out to destroy Lebanon did not  ultimately  intend to destroy the Lebanese experiment and its achievements in the fields of human and political understanding. Lebanon was made to appear doomed to remain a breeding ground for war  anarchy and terror. In a country that itself had become a hostage  citizens of friendly nations were deprived of their liberty and sometimes of their lives.· These innocent individuals were used as pawns in a diplomacy of terror  their lives traded cynically as punishment or reward.Our suffering was made worse by the assassination of Prime Minister Rashid Karame  a great statesman and a man of peace. He was brutally murdered in diabolic plot reminiscent of the assassination of my predecessor and brother  President Bashir Gemayel. To add to our woes  the resilience of the civilian population is now impaired by an economic crisis which is destroying the very fabric of our society. For the first time  Lebanon is haunted by the spectre of famine.I remain determined  as I was five years ago  to pursue Lebanon's struggle for peace and the preservation of our territorial integrity  national sovereignty  unity and independence.These are days for realism. In this spirit I say that what is at stake is not only Lebanon's very existence as a State  but also the ability of the United Nations to prevent the disintegration of a Member State. The history of this Organization's founding is well known. It was established precisely to prevent the destruction of members of the world community. It was founded explicitly because  in the aftermath of the Second World War  all of us recognized that  peace and security ate indivisible. It is of this indivisibility of peace that I wish to speak to the Assembly today.Allow me to be more specific.It is no secret that a number of Middle East wars are waged both in Lebanon and across its borders through an intricate game of surrogates and proxies. These wars have caused invasions  physical destruction and the dismemberment of Lebanon.Year after year  the world community has heard us maintain that peace in Lebanon should not  and cannot  wait for the settlement of every conflict in the Middle East. Today it is imperative to go further and say that peace in the Middle East can begin only with peace in Lebanon. Unless we restore law and order in Lebanon  there cannot and will not be peace anywhere in the region.We are fully aware of what is at stake in the Middle East  from the Mediterranean to the Gulf. We know of the many courageous efforts to initiate peace processes. We are also aware of the numerous resolutions adopted by this Assembly year after year. We have subscribed to all of them In the interest of peace  justice and international security. But we firmly believe that the United Nations must approach the Middle East conflicts as a whole - not just one particular aspect of the Middle East question  but all of them together. Peace in the Middle East is indivisible. Peace cannot survive in one place while a war is under way in another. Nor can we allow ourselves the illusion that containing conflicts on the borders of nations is synonymous with resolving them. Lebanon  again  is the typical and most tragic illustration of what I mean. Truce agreements and bilateral peace accords with Israel cannot solve the Palestinian problem so long as the fate of the Palestinians living in Lebanon has not been equitably determined. Similarly  Iran's war in Lebanon must be addressed and immediately resolved in order to attain peace in the Gulf.At this point I should like to reiterate my support for an international conference to solve the Middle East question. The agenda of the conference as well as its structure should be treated as a matter of extreme urgency. Lebanon insists on being a full partner at the conference  because Lebanon has major problems to discuss in defence of its interests. For  much as we trust the international community  and particularly the Security Council  we face very high stakes. We fear that regional considerations  from which we have suffered so much over the years  might lead us to pay  for others  the price of peace. For boo long we have been paying the price of wars not of our making. Lebanon is neither negotiable nor dispensable.Pending the convening of that Conference  Lebanon finds itself compelled to resort once again to the Security Council. Our goal is to seek implementation of the many resolutions adopted since 1978.We are referring in particular to resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) of June 1978. Those resolutions mandated the creation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with the objective of confirming the withdrawal of Israel and establishing an area of peace and security in southern Lebanon. Furthermore  resolution 426 (1978) called for the reinstatement of the 1949 General Armistice Agreement  There should no longer be any pretext for not implementing it since the Cairo agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLC) has now been officially abrogated. Thus there is no longer any ground to oppose the United Nations overseeing security arrangements on the Lebanese-Israeli frontier  such arrangements  entrusted to a reinforced UNIFIL  would undoubtedly be a credible guarantee of the needed stability.As this Assembly knows  UNIFIL s mandate has been redefined  in resolutions 498 (1981) and 501 (1982). A timetable for Israeli withdrawals and a joint programme of activities between UNIFIL and the Lebanese Government was called for in resolution 488 (1981) in order to promote the restoration of its effective authority up to the internationally recognized boundaries.Other resolutions must be referred to  in particular resolution 436 (1978) of October 1978  which called upon ""all those involved in hostilities in Lebanon to put an end to acts of violence and observe scrupulously an immediate and effective cease-fire and cessation of hostilities so that internal peace and national reconciliation may be restored based on the preservation of Lebanese unity  territorial integrity  independence and national sovereignty"".Finally resolutions 508 (1982) and 5ü9 (1982) of June 1982  as well as resolution 520 (1982)  demanded: ""strict respect of the sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon through the Lebanese Army throughout Lebanon” (Security Council resolution 520 (1982). In due course the Security Council might have to meet and devise the necessary ways and means to implement the relevant resolutions. The objective must be to ensure the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and enable the Lebanese army and the internal security forces to operate exclusively throughout Lebanon  with the assistance of UNIFIL in accordance with its terms of reference.The failure to implement United Nations resolutions has prompted the Lebanese to resist with force continued occupation. The General Assembly has itself recognized this right. Yet we have not despaired and shall not despair of securing withdrawals by appealing to international legitimacy.The 13 years of war that we have survived have demonstrated beyond question that there is no substitute for or alternative to the role of legitimate and accepted institutions. Hence our determination to support our appeal to international legitimacy with a consolidated internal consensus of constitutional legitimacy.Indeed  all past attempts to bypass the legitimate forces and seek internal and external security arrangements with illegal militias have ended in tragic failures. External powers have come up against the same realities in Lebanon.Their attempts to deal with forces outside the recognized legal institutions of the State have not only resulted in similar failures but compounded their problem.The agony of State power  of sovereignty unable to exercise full authority  is coming to an end. People are increasingly disenchanted with the divisive sectarian forces which have brought Lebanon to the threshold of partition or annexation. A credible central Government  even if challenged by various partitionists and their foreign inspirers  remains the only rallying point for the vast majority of the Lebanese  whatever their religious community.In this  my last year in office  I am determined to bring to conclusion a constitutional reform which should reunite the Lebanese and enable us all to save our country  secure our independence and exercise our national sovereignty.I am calling on the international community  and in particular on the great Powers  to help Lebanon disentangle itself from violent interplay amongst the combatants. In so doing we would take the essential step  in conjunction with the international conference  towards Middle East peace. My appeal to the international community is as much in the Interest of regional peace as it is in the interest of Lebanon.If my call is not heeded  let me tell the Assembly where Lebanon is heading. It is on its way towards an economic disaster the first phase of which we are already experiencing. The next phase is likely to be a violent upheaval that will transform not only our liberal economic system  but also the democratic political system on which it is based. When this happens many of the solutions that now seem appropriate will become obsolete. Extremism of all sorts will grow in that fertile ground of despair and the spirit of moderation will be extinguished.The demands for sectarian partition  which now exist as contingent facts in time of war  will increase  creating havoc in the existing State system of the Middle East.Anarchy  unchecked by the hope of order and stability  will encourage terrorism and lead to more kidnapping  more hostage-taking  more alienation from rational policies and a wider chasm between the Middle East and the rest of the world.I have not undertaken this exposition merely to define the problem. I am here today to identify a course of action that we must undertake together. I am not making our crisis international;  it is already international  because it is regional. I am trying to define the problem  contain it and bring it to an end.This course of action begins with a programme of organic and structural reforms which will be initiated through the constitutional process. Thus we shall be responding to the ever-growing conviction that no solution to the crisis can or should be sought outside the constitutional process of a democratic system.A reformed constitution must enable the various Lebanese communities to fulfil an effective and extensive partnership in government. Executive power  exercised through the Council of Ministers  must be genuinely representative of the aspirations of one and all. The changes and needs of the Lebanese society as it has evolved must be accommodated in a manner that will shield us against external exploitation in our domestic affairs. Through a rigorous redefinition of powers and power-sharing any possibilities of hegemony by any group over others should be eliminated.Although the war was not started by the demand for reforms  I am convinced that it will not end without them. A new Government entrusted with this mission will be formed. That Government will have to disarm the militias and direct strengthened and restructured armed forces to extend legal authority over the landIt is Lebanon's historic mission and a geopolitical imperative that the dialogue between Islam and Christianity should be restored and intensified in our land and among our people  for in Lebanon  and Lebanon alone  this dialogue assume its existential dimension  an interaction within the society that will serve the cause of international understanding.Islam is today at an important crossroads. Islam should not be viewed exclusively in terms of so-called Islamic fundamentalism  expressing itself in violence. There is a rebirth of Islam which cannot be understood from the outside abstractly; it cannot be approached with fear or flattery  but only through full partnership in life  culture and government  it is Lebanon's destiny to meet this challenge. Our survival and world peace will depend on the success of the response.Our principal partner in this approach should be Syria  with which relations have often been strained since our emergence as independent states. But there is no reason for the problems between our two countries to continue. Out relations should be normalized. Lebanon is an independent sovereign country  part of the Arab world} and Syria is our closest neighbour in the Arab community. Consequently  relations between Lebanon and Syria should be not only normal but distinctive and characterized by friendship and co-operation  as befits neighbours everywhere. It is in the best interests of both Lebanon and Syria to restore that positive relationship as soon as possible.The principles for an agreement between Lebanon and Syria have been set.Within the parameters of its sovereignty and independence  Lebanon is ready to go a long way to establish the closest relations with Syria. In saying that  I have the deepest interests of both Lebanon and Syria at heart.Syria's military presence in Lebanon since 1976 has extended to over 60 per cent of our territory. This has given Syria overwhelming influence in Lebanon  which has not served the better interests of either country. Through its policy of alliances with Lebanese parties and personalities Syria has generated friendships but also enmities. Although regionally and internationally Syria is perceived as a vital actor in Lebanese affairs  it has been established that there cannot be a Syrian solution to the Lebanese question. But I hasten to add that there is no solution to the Lebanese question without Syria.Specific covenants and treaties govern inter—Arab relations; Lebanon and Syria must see to it that they are respected to the letter  particularly in matters of mutual security and strategic interests. The withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanon should and will take place in the context of those covenants.New relationships should be developed with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)· A new Lebanon cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of old  Lebanon will not tolerate on its territory an armed group of any kind. Only the legitimate organs of the State or organized forces operating in Lebanon at the request of the Lebanese Government will be permitted to carry arms. Lebanon is prepared to grant the PLO a presence on its soil for the peaceful promotion of the cause of the Palestinian people  to which Lebanon is committed. In the context of the Arab League  Lebanon will co-ordinate policies relating to the rights of the Palestinian people. Such policies  however  should not violate law and order in our country  nor lead to Palestinian implantation in Lebanon. Vigorous work requiring close co-ordination will have to be undertaken both to repair the damage done to Lebanese-Palestinian relations and to create new and enduring ties.Finally  the unlearned lessons of the Palestinians must not be ignored by others. Iran must be militarily disentangled from Lebanon. Iran's image in the region and in the world has not been enhanced by its policies in Lebanon or by the acts of violence undertaken by its followers in my country. Indeed  Iran's actions and continued rejection of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) and other Security Council resolutions will further endanger the Lebanese in the south.All Iranians who are in Lebanon by virtue of Iran's self-bestowed military- ideological commitment and without the permission of the Lebanese Government should leave as soon as possible. Yet  Iran has important religious  cultural and commercial links with Lebanon; those links can be encouraged and strengthened by agreement between the two countries  in accordance with the established norms of co-operation among independent and peaceful States.If I have digressed into what appears to be strictly internal affairs it is because  as I stated earlier  peace in Lebanon can be attained only by an encounter between the national and the international·The Lebanese were not free to choose between war and peace. If international peace and security are to be protected against the consequences of continued chaos  violence and terror in Lebanon  the world community must secure for the Lebanese the freedom to choose. I should also like to repeat my firm conviction that peace in the Middle East is indivisible and that peace in Lebanon must be the beginning and not the end.To those  be they friend or foe  who envision that the withering away of Lebanon is a solution to their problems  let me say this: the disappearance or dismemberment of Lebanon will create more problems  more tragedies  and greater violence  in years past my country was proud to be a haven for peace  a link between cultures. Now it has become a haven for terror; a link between wars.But it remains my country  and no sacrifice is too great in its defence."
"82",4008,"LBR",42,1987,"﻿It is for me a great pleasure to convey to Mr. Peter Florin  on behalf of my own President  Mr. Samuel Kanyon Doe  and the Government and people of Liberia  congratulations on his assumption of the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. His unanimous election to his high office clearly reflects the esteem in which he is held by the Members of our Organization. We assure him of our fullest co-operation and support  as we wish him every success in his important assignment.I take the opportunity also to thank his predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  for the able manner in which he conducted the affairs of the forty-first session. We extend special thanks to our Secretary-General for his efficient management of the Secretariat and for his faithful and unrelenting efforts to fulfil the mandates entrusted to him by the Assembly. In particular we commend him both for his efforts to ensure implementation of the administrative reforms required of the Organization and for his latest report  which will be guiding our work during this session of the Assembly.Multilateral coo-operation for the betterment of the human condition is the principal corner-stone upon which this Organization was founded over 40 years ago. In an increasingly interdependent world  nation-States must expand and pursue opportunities to advance their common and mutual interests. Such co-operation implies not only a sense of shared responsibility  but also the need for a collective response to common problems.The world society which we attempt to fashion through this Organization requires the pooling of efforts where resources of individual States are inadequate  the co-ordination of policies where unilateral measures may negate one another  and the provision of a framework for decisive action where uncertainty may inhibit concrete progress. Unfortunately  seething as it is with conflicts and hostilities  our world today falls far short of this perceived ideal of a wholesome environment in which global resources are devoted largely to socio-economic development.Whether it be due to the bankrupt policy of apartheid in South Africa  the frustrating denial of self-determination to the people of Namibia or the persistent crises in the Middle East  the Gulf region  Asia and Central America or elsewhere  the deep hatred created by such conflicts continues to impede the will to collective responsibility and collaborative effort in their resolution. It should therefore be no surprise that many of the issues before this Assembly have remained perennial agenda items  with hardly any solution in sight. In this context  the racist South African regime's persistence in the pursuit of the policy of apartheid has posed one of the most serious challenges to this Organization's declared aim: ""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small"". There can be no doubt that apartheid also contravenes the objective of the United Nations to build a world society free from all forms of segregation and discrimination.That is why my Government has consistently rejected South Africa's apartheid policy and calls upon those that give support and encouragement to the racist regime not only to consider the serious consequences of their action but also to reconsider their position on the adoption of sanctions against South Africa.Regardless of what is said about the merits or demerits of sanctions  the fact is that the inadequacy of the sanctions imposed thus far has apparently had the effect of rendering the racist regime all the more ruthless and intransigent in its oppression of the black majority of the population. Consequently  my Government remains convinced that the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter constitutes the last viable peaceful means of ending this ugly and explosive situation in South Africa  a situation which continues to destabilize the entire region and constitute a threat to world peace and security. My delegation takes this view not unmindful of the importance of negotiations and dialogue  but because of the long-standing refusal of the South African Government itself to meet and to negotiations with the leaders of the liberation movements.As regards the related question of Namibia  Liberia cannot accept the continued defiance of the authority of the United Nations  and considers South Africa's recalcitrance to be a grave challenge to the credibility of this Organization. It is most regrettable  in this connection  that three decades after the commencement of the decolonisation process in Africa Namibia should still be languishing under the yoke of colonialism. Our frustration is further heightened by attempts on the part of the racist regime and its collaborators to insist on linking the proposed withdrawal of Cuban internationalist forces from Angola to the question of Namibia's independence.My delegation therefore calls for the unconditional and complete withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia so that that Territory can at last gain its full independence  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  and take its rightful place in this Organization and elsewhere. We submit in this connection that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the most viable basis for the attainment of this objective. There are other regional conflicts which are also the subject of continuing dialogue and negotiation within the international community. That is as it should be  since we are enjoined by the Charter to pursue the settlement of disputes by peaceful means.Accordingly we must commend the Secretary-General for his ongoing efforts to restore peace and stability in the Persian Gulf. The war between Iraq and Iran  which has lasted for nearly a decade  has taken a very heavy toll on human life and property  disrupted freedom of trade and navigation in the region and even escalated to the point where chemical weapons have been used against civilian targets  including women and children. We must once again urge all concerned to comply with the provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which calls for the cessation of hostilities and the opening of negotiations between the two parties.In the Middle East the question of the right of the Palestinians to a homeland and the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries continues to be disputed by the parties. Those rights must of course be recognized and upheld through peaceful means. In this connection an international conference on the Middle East could prove useful  provided that it facilitated the evolution of a solution acceptable to all concerned.While taking note of recent political developments in South Korea we wish also to encourage the resumption of dialogue at ministerial level towards the reunification of South and North Korea. Furthermore  my Government believes that membership in the United Nations of North and South Korea should broaden the scope for a peaceful reunification of that divided country.It is a fundamental right of peoples to determine their own form of government and to choose whatever political  economic and social systems they may wish  free from outside interference or constraints of any kind equally  sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence are all inviolable attributes of nations. In this connection the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from both Kampuchea and Afghanistan should be accelerated to enable those countries to exercise fully their freedom.By the same token we consider the establishment and maintenance of peace in Central America to be the prime responsibility of the Governments in that region. We therefore welcome the recent Guatemala Agreement as a useful foundation for genuine peace and stability in Central America and call on the international community to lend its fullest support to that Agreement.On a similar note  my Government also invites the international community to lend its support to current initiatives of the Organization of African unity towards the peaceful resolution of the conflict between Libya and Chad Most of the conflicts and hostilities ate fuelled by an arras race that is consuming a disproportionate share of the world's scarce resources. Because the international community can ill afford to continue on such a course  we welcome the historic international Conference held recently on the relationship between disarmament and development. That Conference could be viewed as a first step not just towards a safer world but also towards a more judicious utilization of the earth's resources. Having said that  my delegation believes that any appreciable level of disarmament should be buttressed by workable guarantees for States  through effective arrangements for the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.In this connection my Government notes with satisfaction the recent agreement in principle concluded between the Governments of the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons. We urge those nations to continue their negotiations to a successful conclusion. In addition to the issues of war and peace which we have highlighted here there are also a number of serious problems plaguing the global economy  problems that continue to defy and frustrate traditional solutions. In practically every forum of the world today such issues as those concerning the need for monetary and fiscal reform  the increasing volume and cost of third-world debt  the declining level of real official development assistance  the drastic fall in third-world commodity prices  spiralling inflation  the deteriorating terms of trade  the increasing protectionist tendencies of industrialized countries  are all finding their way to the very top of the agenda. These and similar problems have been generally identified with  if not considered as  the direct root causes of unemployment  sustained poverty and overall negative growth in most third-world countries.However  what is truly noteworthy  as we know  is that these problems have arisen and persisted not because the world lacks the raw materials or the technological capacity to produce enough for its growing population  which has now reached five billion and is increasing by the second  but largely because our States have as yet not been able to agree on a fairer and more rational system of managing the world's economy.As some speakers before me have pointed out  the old alignments and configurations of the international economy will no longer suffice. For instance  no concept of development can be accepted today which continues to condemn the majority of the world's population to starvation  malnutrition  substandard living in conditions of despair. The widening gap between rich and poor countries has often been traced to the industrial revolution and to slavery and colonialism  in which the development of industry in the Western world was said to have been facilitated in great measure by massive infusions of resources  both human and material  from what is now referred to as the third world. That  parenthetically  raises a most interesting question about the unrelenting pressures now being exerted on third-world countries to repay their debts; is there not another debt that we are forgetting  that may not have been fully repaid  or even considered?The point  however  is not that industrialization did not increase the wealth of Europe and North America  or that slavery and colonial exploitation did not retard the development of the third world; the point is simply that this situation  which has remained essentially unchanged notwithstanding the great wave of decolonisation that has seen the creation of nearly 100 new independent States over the last 40 years  is no longer a tenable or acceptable proposition.The traditional  almost stereotypical  division of labour which relegated third-world countries to the status of primary producers must now give way to a new arrangement that should not only enable developing countries to engage in the manufacturing of finished and semi-finished products but also require the developed economies to consume more of those products. We commend and completely agree with those  among them the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany  who have called here for the age-old one-sided relationship between developed and developing countries to be restructured.As regards the role of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in economic development we must  of course  commend them for their untiring efforts in research and information  in policy analysis and practical action and in technical assistance  where they have contributed to the development activities of third—world countries. Only last year the United Nations convened a special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. Since then  many African countries have undertaken strong measures to fulfil their commitments under the economic recovery and development Programme adopted at that session. For example  in its own economic recovery programme  Liberia  under the leadership of President Samuel Kanyon Doe  has embarked upon a number of measures to improve the management of the public sector  to restore to its proper place the key role of private initiative and enterprise in economic growth and development and to design strategies foe integrated rural development  with emphasis on agriculture and food self-sufficiency  through a green revolution programme.But  as was recognized by the special session  the international community was expected to complement the resources and self-help efforts of third world countries for their economic recovery. Unfortunately  most donor countries have so far done very little to demonstrate  much less fulfil  their commitment to the Programme  this  my country and Government find most regrettable and disappointing.Indeed  our world today is over-burdened with political and territorial disputes and with serious economic and social crises  all of which threaten the very foundations of peace  security and development on our planet. In the circumstances  there can be no social responsibility more important or task more weighty than that of the search for efficient and lasting solutions to these problems. And in this onerous task our most urgent need is for strong leadership and a new vision  tempered by a greater sense of collective moral responsibility and a complete change of attitude based on a rededication to international solidarity.Indeed  this global village which is our common heritage will be neither a better place in which to live nor a worthy legacy to bequeath to posterity unless we can urgently return to the fundamental values of love and charity and the proposition that each one is his brother's keeper. International relations can no longer be based solely on a delicate balancing of conflicting interests  or on the unremitting and fierce competition of nations to achieve material objectives and superiority at all cost. These relations must now be founded firmly on the universally accepted principles of justice and fair play   tolerance  protection of the weak and freedom from domination by the strong. Of course  these are not new values or concepts in the United Nations.Over the years this Organization has emerged as the authentic voice of humanity's collective conscience. There is now  however  a dire need to strengthen our moral capacity and reinforce our political will to enable the United Nations to tackle more effectively its many complex problems  to which  in some cases  normal political approaches may not be applicable or even feasible.It cannot be denied that there is a moral and ethical dimension to the struggle against ignorance  disease and poverty  against such social ills as drug abuse  prostitution  slavery  child labour and torture/ and that there is such a dimension to programmes such as those which provide for the immunization of children  better housing and Medicare for the people  a greater role for women In development  food security for all and the protection of the environment. The same humanitarian spirit as recently mobilized and co-ordinated international assistance to Ethiopia  Sudan and Mexico  among others  should now be cultivated and fully extended to other areas of need in the world.In this connection  and referring again to the Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  ray delegation submits that there might be an even more poignant relationship to be considered  namely  that between disarmament and disease. Let us take the real case of the current AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) epidemic. Very soon the global effect of that deadly epidemic could reach proportions comparable only to the devastation that could result from a nuclear explosion  which knows no national boundaries. There is no doubt that much more could be done to intensify the search for a vaccine and/or a cure for the AIDS epidemic if a relatively small portion of the billions of dollars now spent on arms could be placed at the disposal of the scientific and medical community for this purpose.Two other areas of concern that the United Nations could take as a moral imperative are the problem of third world debt and the combined questions of the liberation of South Africa and independence for Namibia  to which we referred earlier. For reasons already recounted here  the problem of debt truly poses a moral challenge to the developed world and to institutions for international development assistance. Nothing short of a substantial  if not total  conversion into grants of the debts owed them by third world countries may be required to enable many of these countries to survive even marginally while their serious structural problems and the inequities of the international marketplace are redressed. My delegation firmly believes that the United Nations could play a vital role in sensitising the creditor nations and institutions to the need for urgent relief action.As for man's inhumanity to man  wherever found and whether it assumes the form of genocide  slavery  colonial exploitation or the displacement of peoples  it has always been morally indefensible. In this connection  the continuing existence of apartheid in South Africa constitutes an affront to the collective conscience of mankind. Regular reports and accounts of the brutal excesses of the apartheid regime contain disturbing overtones of torture camps in recent history. The world must surely act now to end apartheid. For its part  Liberia reaffirms its determination to carry on the struggle until the last vestiges of colonialism and all other forms of exploitation are removed from southern Africa and every other part of the world where such human rights abuses are found.It is our fervent hope that the United Nations will continue to be not only a forum in which to engage in dialogue on global matters  but also a forum in which to galvanize our collective political will and moral courage to secure the long-term interest of mankind. "
"83",4054,"LBY",42,1987,"﻿I should first like to extend to you. Sir  our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I am absolutely sure that your long experience and your well-known skills ensure positive results by this important session. We are particularly pleased to see in the Chair a representative of your country  which is a friend of the Jamahiriya and linked to it by strong relations of friendship and understanding. I assure you of our readiness to co-operate fully with you as you discharge your high task.I express my country's appreciation also to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  who presided over the forty-first session of the Assembly with outstanding skill. We believe that his guidance as President played a large part in the success achieved by that session.I pay a tribute also to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for the efforts he has made and continues to make to promote the role of the Organization and to achieve its purposes and principles  particularly in the maintenance of international peace and security.I also congratulate Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed on his appointment to the post of Under-Secretary—General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. This is the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  an organization which  despite its shortcomings and the loopholes in its Charter  remains the only hope that the international community has for the achievement of peace and security based on justice  and of the well-being and equality of peoples. The peoples of the world - and it is they who are mentioned at the very beginning of the Charter - have always looked to this Organization to fulfil their hopes and aspirations  in freedom  justice and equality.When the Organization was established  everyone believed that that would be the beginning of the end of existing international struggles and struggles based n hegemony and racial and ethnic discrimination. The whole world opposed Nazism and fascism as aberrant phenomena. The family of nations joined hands to eradicate those dangers and to stem their tide. Libya  which was one of the victims of fascist aggression lost more than half its population opposing and resisting that aggression during a long and bitter period of struggle  fully appreciates the importance of the world's and mankind's victory over fascism and Nazism.In the field of decolonisation the United Nations has achieved many successes and victories. The struggle of peoples in all the continents of the world  and in our African continent in particular  has been crowned by many victories  which led to the demise of colonization and the smashing of its chains. However  those victories in fighting fascism and Nazism achieved by the community of nations have encountered many setbacks because of the emergence of imperialism  racist Zionism and neo-colonialism. Today we see entire peoples facing extermination or dispersion.The tragedy of the people of Palestine  a tragedy caused by the alliance between imperialism  world Zionism and colonialism  is seen in the attempts to eradicate the Palestinian people. That tragedy can indeed be considered the worst tragedy in our contemporary history. The United Nations  which was used as an instrument to legitimise the aggressor and deprive the victims of their rights through the creation of the Zionist entity  has a moral responsibility to correct that historical mistake.The establishment of the racist regime in South Africa - the counterpart of the racist regime in Palestine - through the same instrument is but another example of the historical tragedies being forced upon peoples. The violation of the rights of millions of African blacks in South Africa and Namibia and the inhuman treatment meted out to them make this a shameful chapter in the history of our time. The racist regime in South Africa can be ended only if imperialist States cease their direct support for that regime. Furthermore  the independent of Namibia  to which imperialist Powers are attempting to create obstacles and which they are trying to prevent by creating new conditions  can be achieved rapidly only on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).We believe that the time has come to impose economic sanctions on the racist regime to force it into line with the will of the international community. We further believe that the racist regime must allow the people of Azania to determine its own future in freedom and without any pressure whatsoever  so that we may at last hear the voice of the black majority  which has not been allowed to be raised at any time in the past. Nor has that majority been allowed to participate in ruling its country. Stability and peace cannot be restored to Azania unless the national rights of the black majority are fully recognized.Despite the attempts by mankind and the family of nations to achieve peace  the savage campaign by the United States Administration against small countries and peace-loving peoples cannot but make the picture a very depressing picture and underline the nature of the State terrorism practised by that Administration. Mi у peoples have been in the past and continue to be subjected to that imperialist campaign  whether directly or indirectly  in every one of the world's five continents. The Vietnamese people was subjected to mass extermination·  Grenada is subjected to direct invasion and occupation; Nicaragua has been the subject of siege and aggression; Cuba is the subject of aggression; Libya was the victim of direct aggression from the north  while today it is subjected to the same aggression on its southern borders; Palestinian refugee camps have been and continue to be destroyed; there have been and continue to be attempts at the mass extermination of the Palestinian people  inside and outside occupied Palestine  with the use of American weapons of destruction and with the support of the American Administration. That Administration has provided the Zionist entity with all types of weapons to commit aggression against the Palestinian people and expand  at the expense of neighbouring Arab countries  in the Golan and in Lebanon.Furthermore  American imperialism does not hide its enmity towards the Arab world and has widely proclaimed its strategic alliance with the Zionist enemy.Old  traditional colonialism  which was kicked out of the front door  is today trying by all possible means to return through the back door. French colonialism  which suffered many setbacks in the African continent  faced defeat in Algeria and was forced to leave its colonies in the African continent  is today attempting to return through the back door. French bases on the African continent  and in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are all a direct threat to and aggression against small countries and peace-loving peoples. The continuing occupation by France of a part of the African continent  is in the case of the island of Reunion  and other parts of the world  such as New Caledonia  where the will of the people is being misrepresented  are outstanding examples of the remnants of this abhorrent colonialism.Libya  which was one of the victims of aggression and direct French intervention  cannot but draw the attention of the international community and the world to the danger of French occupation  intervention and presence in the African continent  particularly in Chad. We have heard the Foreign Minister of France speaking of the ""responsibility"" of France. What responsibility is he talking about? Is it the responsibility of the wolf to its victim? Is it the responsibility of the master to those he wishes to continue to enslave? What role has France to intervene in Africa? Perhaps it is the right of the wolf as comparable to the lamb. We say to the French Government from this international rostrum the time when colonialism could use its heavy stick has gone forever. Algeria is no longer French. Viet Nam  following Dien Bien Phu  is no longer French. Libya is no longer part of the fascist empire of Mussolini. The age of colonialist and fascist treaties and conventions to divide the world and its people has also gone forever. May I also recall that Libya  which fought fascism  Libya  which lost half its population defending its land and waters  will not give up any part of its territory under any condition. Aouzou is Libyan and will remain so. We do not need any French scrolls or documents to prove it is so.We believe in the inevitability of the victory of peoples  despite all the tragedies and plights to which humanity has been subjected. The presence of such a large number of Member States which struggled in the past against colonialism and which struggle today against imperialism is resplendent proof that history cannot be rolled back; it is proof of the inevitability of the victory of peoples. Despite the attempts of imperialist Powers to divide peoples and to sow seeds of dissent among them  we can still say  and say emphatically  that the world today realizes more than at any time in the past the true nature of colonialist-imperialist plots.What happened in 1948 when plots were made to partition Palestine  disperse its people and legitimise the aggressor will not be repeated in the name of the United Nations. The United Nations today is very different from the United Nations of yesteryear.For the United Nations to undertake its role fully  it must be changed in a way that will never allow the Organization and the members of the international community to ignore new political and economic realities that have emerged on the international scene. The paralysis of United Nations resolutions  the rejection of its will  indeed the flouting of the United Nations and the non-observance by some major Powers of their commitment to the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights must not be repeated.Certain rights and privileges of some States - the right of veto  for example - runs counter to the simplest rules of equality among Member States provided in the United Nations Charter - are an obstacle in the way of a truly effective role for the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace ; d security. The right of veto has been continually used against the international will to defend the aggressor and justify aggression and occupation. The time has come for the international community to get rid of that privilege  which is clear y counter to the principle of equality among Member States provided for in the Charter of the United Nations.We welcome all agreements between the two super-Powers to achieve disarmament and peace. However  as small peoples we have learned from our experience not to e over-optimistic. Imperialist Powers will not give up their ambitions or their objectives of hegemony and domination. Imperialist Powers exploit all attempts I peace-loving States to achieve peace and use every opportunity to attack small peoples  usurp their riches  monopolize their wealth and destroy their economies.I have said that  despite the achievements of the United Nations  hotbeds o: tension  dispute and war exist in many parts of the world. Those Powers which reject peace and justice feed those disputes and  indeed  they lead to the fanning of more such disputes in order to try out their weapons and achieve their imperialist aggressive aims. The time has come for the United Nations to achieve peace and security  based on the interests of peoples  not on those of the monopolies.The war in the Gulf must be brought to an end; it is a war between two neighbouring Muslim States whose resources must be devoted to the interests of their peoples} their joint efforts must be devoted to standing together with other Islamic and Arab countries in the region against the joint imperialist-Zionist threat. Only the imperialist Powers have an interest in the continuation of this war - a war through which those imperialist Powers attempt to gain a stronger foothold. By amassing forces in the region they wish to inflame that war. We express support for the Secretary-General's efforts to end that war as soon as possible  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.The situation in Latin America and Central America cannot be improved and peace cannot be restored to those two regions unless the imperialist intervention is brought to an end. Imperialism is supporting mercenaries in the area. We salute the efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group in Central America as represented in the Guatemala agreement  which we believe is the only way to solve the problem. We should also like to emphasize our support of  and solidarity with  the peoples of Nicaragua and Cuba against imperialist intervention and aggression.I have mentioned attempts by imperialism and colonialism to sow seeds of dissent among African brothers. Allow me to say that the solution to the Chad problem can be found essentially - as has been emphasized by various parties and even by Mr. Habré himself - in an end to French intervention  the withdrawal of French and imperialist Powers from Chad  and achievement of national interests among all Chadian factions.The Jamahiriya has always expressed its willingness to help in solving the Chad problem. Libya recently declared  through the leader of its Revolution  that it would leave the Chadians to solve their own problems and that it no longer considered that there was any problem whatever between it and Chad. Furthermore  the Jamahiriya has expressed its complete readiness to co-operate with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the good offices committee assigned by that organization at its most recent meeting held in Lusaka to deal with the Chad problem.To date  the problem of Western Sahara has not been solved in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of the OAU"" to solve the problem in accordance with the relevant resolutions and in a way that would ensure justice and equality.The Jamahiriya  which has 1 900 kilometres of coast on the Mediterranean  is very keen to see it become a sea of peace and security for all Mediterranean countries and for the world as a whole. However - and most unfortunately - the Sea continues to be a region of tension owing to the presence there of imperialist fleets in its waters and imperialist-colonialist military bases on its shores  If those fleets and bases remain in the area  that will lead only to more tension and the possibility of new conflagrations in that area. Libya has been the victim of treacherous American military aggression during which the waters and airspace of that sea were used. That aggression was directed against Libya in an attempt to abort the Libyan revolution and to kill its leader. In General Assembly resolution 41/38 the international community clearly condemned the aggression after having first agreed at its forty-first session to include an item in its agenda - item 142 - to discuss the issue.The solution to the Cypriot problem can be achieved through co-operation between the two communities in Cyprus  Greek and Turkish  on the basis of a United  non-aligned Cyprus and the elimination of imperialist colonialist British bases there. The Jamahiriya supports the efforts of the Secretary-General towards the achievement of a peaceful and just settlement of the question of Cyprus.In the Asian continent we notice many hot spots of tension. My country  which enjoys excellent relations with the Asian States believes that efforts to solve the problems and eliminate these hot spots of tension must be continued. The agreement signed by the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Viet Nam is likely to resolve problems in the area in a way that will guarantee the rights of their peoples and their socio-economic choices.We in the Arab world have been subjected to efforts to divide us. We fully appreciate  therefore  the importance of the reunification of Korea in a peaceful framework. We support dialogue and mutual understanding towards that goal and we call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korean land. I cannot fail to mention here  however briefly  the international economic situation and the economic crisis faced by the peoples of the world  particularly the third world. The international economic crisis is becoming more grave every year  and it is the developing countries  my country included  that are most seriously affected. Indeed  the peoples of those countries are already bearing the brunt of those consequences. In fact  the developing countries have begun experiencing the effects of economic stagnation  as reflected in their inability t achieve the economic growth needed to guarantee a minimum level of development and progress. The least developed countries face the spectre of hunger and poverty as well as deterioration in all sectors of their economies  particularly in the African and South-East Asian regions affected by drought. The international economic crisis can be appropriately addressed only if the world moves towards dialogue and attempts to eradicate the factors that have provoked it  in the forefront of which is the flagrant injustice being imposed on the developing and the least developed countries because of instability in international economic affairs. The developed countries must restore balance if they are to avoid the effects of the current imbalance from spilling over into their own economies. Tariff barriers on imports must be removed. Furthermore  the developed countries must devote more attention to achieving real stability in the international monetary system.The North-South dialogue will succeed only if the developed countries make concessions with regard to their selfish goals and exercise the moral responsibility they bear towards developing countries. That dialogue can be enhanced by a genuine South-South dialogue and solidarity among third world countries.The world is going through a critical stage of large military blocs and many imperialist and colonialist interventions·  hence it is in dire need of the Non-Aligned Movement  The Jamahiriya strongly supports that Movement  for we are fully convinced that it has a constructive role to play to decrease tension and achieve international peace and security. We in the Non-Aligned Movement are this year celebrating its twenty-sixth anniversary. On this occasion we hail Its many successes  some of which  unfortunately  have made many of its members the object of imperialist campaigns merely because they have held strongly to the principles and objectives of the Movement as the sole hope for humanity.May I  in conclusion  say that promoting the role of the United Nations - an Organization the imperialist Powers wish to weaken - will be a true guarantee for the achievement of its objectives·  international peace and security. Attempts to solve disputes outside the United Nations and dividing the world into blocs can only lead to undermining the Organization. Small countries  which make up the overwhelming majority of the membership of this Organization  bear the fundamental responsibility to support the Organization because small countries  including Libya  can but consider their membership of the Organization as one of the best guarantees of their independence and freedom. Pot that reason we must foster mutual effective co-operation in order to enable our Organization to fulfil its role free from any hegemony or intervention."
"84",4086,"LCA",42,1987,"﻿Sir  I take great pleasure in joining those speakers who have already congratulated you upon your election to the high office of President of this venerable world body. I am fully confident that  under your able guidance  our difficult deliberations in the weeks ahead will beat much good fruit. You may rest assured of the full coo-operation of my delegation.I should also like to thank your predecessor  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  for his excellent work in conducting our affairs during the forty-first session of the General Assembly Each session of the United Nations General Assembly is convened  as it were  by a summons to all Member nations  exhorting them: ""Come  let us reason together "" and in this regard  the words of the Saint Lucian Nobel Prize winner. Sir Arthur Lewis  are instructive;""We must continue to make the problems of each the official concern of all  that they may be resolved by discussion and mutual concession.""In the conduct of our international affairs. Saint Lucia has always been  and will always be  guided by its deep concern for the attainment of universal peace  respect for human rights and economic development and  in reflecting on the four decades that separate us from the end of the Second World War and the creation of the United Nations  we ate saddened by the realization that the insanity of the last world conflict has never really receded from international affairs during these last 42 years.The world which emerged after the Second World War has been one divided into blocks by two competing super-Powers. Their over-riding objectives of promoting and protecting their competing ideologies have led to global suspicions  tension and hostility  and have dragged nations small  young and tender  like Saint Lucia  into regional conflicts completely detrimental to the interests of these small States. Since 1945  the nations of the world have killed over 40 million of their people in local wars. Today  from Central America to North Africa  from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf to Kampuchea  local wars are raging with the consequential destruction of human life  prosperity and the environment  and from north—east Asia to Central Europe  brothers find themselves hemmed in by hostile creeds  glaring at each other across ideological frontiers. The horrors of international local wars are made worse as brother battles brother from South America to southern Africa  from East Africa to South Asia.While we have been able to avoid a Third World War  it is small comfort that a contributory factor has been the spectre of mutually assured destruction from the nuclear weapons stockpiled by the super-Powers. And although there is general agreement that a second Noah' s ark will not emerge from a nuclear deluge  neither will there be a second genesis in another Garden of Eden. The threat of a thermonuclear Armageddon remains an ever constant reality. The arms race is  however  unflagging  and expenditure on arms has continued to soar  diverting into its vortex millions of dollars that could have liberated the world from underdevelopment  hunger and disease.But in recent times there have been some small signs that a semblance of sanity is creeping back into the judgement of men; some not unpropitious events which give cause for the hope that we may be approaching a new tide in the affairs of men.The announcement early in the life of this session of the General Assembly that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed in principle to dismantle an entire class of nuclear weapons - the intermediate-range missiles - is one such welcome sign. It is the earnest hope of Saint Lucia  and I am certain of the international community  that the proposed intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty will be but the first step in a journey which we hope will end  not in the total elimination of mankind  but with the total elimination of nuclear weapons.As the super-Powers inch towards nuclear agreements  so too are there small signs of hope in those countries that have been the quintessential examples of the East-West ideological divisions that have separated us since the last world war.The recent high-level contact between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany was most significant. My delegation hopes that this historic visit is but a foretaste of the quality of co-operation and understanding yet to come.In the Koreas  we feel that many recent activities augur well for the future. Saint Lucia would welcome the peaceful reunification of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the basis of agreements worked out by the Korean people themselves. We are therefore supportive of all topical proposals aimed at a renewed dialogue between the Korean people on reunification and  in the interim  we believe that full membership of the United Nations for the two Koreas would not hinder the efforts of unity towards this end. We believe that the coming 1988 Olympics presents an opportunity .for dialogue and co-operation that should not be missed.Our region of the world has not escaped the effects of the ideological wars and rivalry of the super-Powers. Saint Lucia has for some time now been quite concerned with the situation in Central America and its implications for the peace and security of the entire region. We have always held the position that the countries of the region have the right to live in peace and to decide their own future  free from outside interference or intervention. We have also consistently maintained the view that the problems of the region are rooted in deep-seated local social and economic deprivation  and are therefore not amenable to armed or military solutions. We have therefore always supported the efforts of the Contadora Group and  more recently  the Support Group to end the conflict in Central America. We welcomed the Cancun Declaration on Peace in Central America and the Document of Objectives  which set the foundation for the inauguration of negotiations with a view to ensuring harmonious coexistence in Central America. Saint Lucia expresses its full support for the peace plan signed by the five Central American Presidents and welcomes the creation of a role for both the United Nations and the Organization of American States in the implementation of the plan. We call upon all States to pledge their full co-operation to assist in its realization. Let those who dared to draw their swords  be now courageous enough  not only to sheathe them  but to take a bold leap of faith for peace. Let all men of goodwill remember that what the poor of the region desire is not guns  but simply a better and more fulfilling way of life  and let them lend their support to the cause of peace.In the Caribbean  the Haitian people have cast off the yoke of oppression and are on the way to establishing a democratic system of government. We therefore look forward  not to the mere holding of elections in November this year  but to elections that will be free and fair and free from fear. We are confident  however  that the people of Haiti  whose forefathers were the first people to establish a free nation in the Caribbean  can and will find the wherewithal to continue on the road to liberation. But we must never forget that democracy is best created and sustained by economic progress. We therefore call upon all those who are in a position to do so to assist the Haitian people in this time of need.Amidst those signs of hope are areas in dire need of redress. And where peace should have been on the throne  it still remains on the scaffold. In Central America  Guatemala still threatens the independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of our sister Caribbean Community partner  Belize  with its persistent claim to its territory. Guatemala's uncompromising attitude on this matter has been a source of much distress to Saint Lucia. We hope that the Guatemalan President  His Excellency Mr. Vincio Cerezo Arevalo  who has shown such leadership and diplomatic skill in dealing with other Central American problems  will be magnanimous in addressing the matter.In the South Atlantic  there has been too little movement towards solving the Falkland/Malvinas problem. The restoration of democracy in Argentina has presented an excellent opportunity for renewed dialogue between two countries that  for almost two centuries  have enjoyed a great degree of friendship. We urge both sides  in the spirit of compromise  to seize this opportunity.The question of Cyprus has been on the agenda of this body for much  much too long. Saint Lucia continues to maintain its full support for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. We believe that the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the high-level agreements of 10 February 1977 and 19 May 1979 form the basis for a just and lasting settlement of the question. Accordingly  we welcome the proposal made by the President of Cyprus for the total demilitarisation of the State  and the unconditional withdrawal of all troops and settlers of occupation. We urge the Secretary-General to continue to use his good offices with a view to facilitating a speedy settlement.In South Africa  the intolerable situation continues to aggravate the international community as the apartheid regime stubbornly maintains its abhorrent system of racial oppression at home and its stranglehold on Namibia in defiance of international law. Has not the dehumanisation and brutalisation of the oppressed peoples of South Africa been affronting the world long enough? Must South Africa continue to flout every attempt by the United Nations and the Commonwealth to end its racial insanity and to restore dignity  peace and freedom to that land?Have we not realized that until the evil of apartheid is totally eradicated all of us  no matter who we are or where we are  will be accomplices in the vilest system of degradation ever visited upon man by man himself?Some of the front-line States of southern Africa have known no peace since their independence for having provided support for the just struggles of the oppressed people of South Africa. They  too  require an opportunity for peaceful development. We wish to assure them that  despite our size  they can count on us for whatever assistance we can render in the cause of freedom.The apartheid regime mocks the world even more by perpetuating its intransigence over Namibia in that it continues to use dilatory tactics to frustrate the legitimate right of the Namibian people to self-determination  Saint Lucia strongly condemns the apartheid regime for the imposition of the so-called interim government in Namibia on 17 June 1985  in defiance of the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Saint Lucia reiterates its recognition of the national liberation movement  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  as the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  and its support for the inalienable right of the Namibian people to self-determination  freedom and independence  with full territorial integrity. In northern Africa  the tragedy of famine in the Sahel  aggravated by war  continues to haunt us. In the Persian Gulf the war between Iran and Iraq drags on  destroying more and more lives and threatening to erupt into a wider conflagration as other nations dispatch their armadas into the Gulf. The admirable co-operation of all members of the Security Council in adopting resolution 598 (1987)  on 20 July last  is to be applauded  but  in the absence of compliance; we urge the members of the Council to find the necessary political will to bring the full weight of the Charter to bear on the warring parties. If Member States of the United Nations will not respect the decisions of the Security Council  then we are in fact eroding not only the authority of the Council but also the integrity of the Organization itself. This leads us to examine one more cause for concern today: the role of the United Nations itself. Some credit must be given to the United Nations for general world peace over the last 40-odd years; at the very least  the Organization has served as a palliative  bringing the moral authority of the rest of the world to bear on warring parties# and thereby helping to preclude the general widening of bilateral or regional conflicts.However  we cannot escape the fact that the United Nations has had extremely limited success in preventing  and resolving  local conflicts since the Second World War. We cannot deny that most combatants have circumvented the conflict resolution mechanisms of this Organization before going to war. And  in more recent times  as the super-Powers have jostled for supremacy  as some nations have tried to stamp their point of view on others  there has been a retreat from multilateralism. As a result  the United Nations itself suffers  as nations respond only lethargically to its basic financial needs.Saint Lucia's aspiration for universal peace is inextricably linked to a vibrant and increasingly strengthened United Nations. We continue to hold the view that the United Nations is the last  best hope for mankind. Its diminution is linked to the failure of nation States to recognize the vital role it has played in maintaining world peace in the past 40 years. It is not coincidental that there has been an almost inverse relationship between military expenditure as a percentage of world gross national product and the influence of the Organization. As that influence reached a nadir about 1980  we saw an acceleration of military expenditure to about 5 per cent per year in real terms. It now nears $1 trillion per year - well above that of the immediate post-war period  when the United Nations was at its most influential. Saint Lucia believes that without a strong United Nations  we cannot continue to hold the line that prevents local conflicts from becoming global  let alone resolve the local conflicts themselves. We must not therefore  through lack of financial support  hold the Organization to ransom for some narrow national goal with which we perceive it to be out of consonance. If the prospects for universal peace are to improve we must reintroduce the necessary political will into the halls of the Security Council and the General Assembly. We can improve on the United Nations  but we cannot do without it.Saint Lucia takes its commitment to regional and international organizations very seriously. Over the years  in the Caribbean  we have lent our full support to the process of greater functional co-operation and integration. In the eastern Caribbean in particular  we have helped forge the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)  which includes among other things a single central bank for our several countries. As the unswerving dedication of its member States has blossomed into great strength for the Organization in a few short years  we have decided to accept the challenge of the logic of its success and to take the ultimate step into a full political union of all our willing member States. The implications and logistics of this proposed political union are now being studied.If we can pool our resources - our markets  our capital  our defences  our people - if we can reduce the costs of our administrations  in which we have seven Governors-General  seven Prime Ministers and 60 Ministers  for a total population of about 500 000  we shall be better able to deliver a higher quality of life for our people and play a more effective role in international affairs· We have already received pledges of support from our colleagues in the wider Caribbean community  and we are sure that  as the wisdom of our endeavour unfolds  we shall be able to count on the support of our neighbours in Latin America  and our friends in the rest of the world.	When the Charter of the United Nations was framed  little thought was given to the conception of small States such as Saint Lucia. But countries like ours have special problems which need to be addressed quite seriously by this body. Consequently  the slow progress of initiatives in favour of island developing countries after over a decade of discussions and resolutions in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  the General Assembly and elsewhere  remains a matter of great concern to Saint Lucia. The myriad special problems of those countries  including vulnerability to natural disasters such as that which struck the eastern Caribbean only last month  continue to pose major hindrances to the development process.We therefore regret that the comprehensive review of the progress made in - assisting those countries  as mandated by General Assembly resolution 39/212 of 18 December 1984  did not take place last year. My delegation is consequently preparing some new initiatives which will facilitate the General Assembly's action on this question next year.The economic plight of the developing countries continues to be most unsatisfactory  while global output grew by 3 per cent last year  the developing countries lost $94 billion as a result of constantly deteriorating terms of trade  and national income fell by as much as 10 per cent in some developing countries. This rather undesirable state of affairs is further compounded by a seriously diminishing interest in private sector investment in the developing world  and a general weakening of official financial flows. Non-concessional bilateral credits to the developing countries have also decreased  as have credit flows from the International Monetary Fund. In fact  repayments to the Fund from the developing countries last year exceeded new credits by almost $3 billion. All o£ this  added to the burdensome debt of the developing world and the increasing protectionism in the developed market economies  is the right formula for disaster.The sluggish growth of the global economy already reflects the drag of the developing countries' economies} redressing these imbalances is therefore paramount. Each day the global village grows smaller and smaller  as all of us grow more dependent on each other. Upon being told that man would soon embark on a search for intelligent life in space  an old lady responded that it would be nothing more than a search for new enemies. ""After all""  she said  ""if we cannot get along with the man across the street  how can we expect to get along with the people up there?""In our intercourse with the various peoples of the world  there is only one conclusion that can be reached. We are all essentially one and indivisible  in reason  in form  in movement  in needs and. in ideals. Every man cherishes his liberty. No man enjoys being dominated by another. Every man wants to live in peace  to enjoy the good things of life and to see the world rid of ignorance  of poverty and of disease.For our children  and for theirs  we yearn for nothing less  and to these ends  the intellectual treasures of the Earth can and should first be harnessed.There is yet time to begin. When will we begin?"
"85",4159,"LKA",42,1987,"﻿Let me at the outset convey to the President the warm and sincere felicitations of Sri Lanka on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Sri Lanka and the German Democratic Republic have enjoyed a fruitful association of co-operation in bilateral and international affairs  an association which has been further strengthened by exchanges of visits at a high level between our two countries recently.A special word of gratitude is due from us to the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  my friend and colleague from the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC)   for his outstanding contribution to the forty-first session as President.To strike a personal note  it is now a decade since I first addressed the General Assembly as Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka. For the last 10 years I have had the opportunity to observe the vagaries of the international situation  both economic and political. Many of the items I saw on the agenda in 1977 have eluded settlement. This has not always been for want of solutions. For many of these problems the General Assembly has  often by consensus  prescribed solutions based on the principles and purposes of the Charter. Unfortunately  those prescriptions have not been dispensed  nor have solutions been implemented. However  I will not outline the reasons for this sad state of affairs. They are very well known.Permit me to look at the global economic situation. The 1980s are already being characterized as the lost decade of development. The development process as a whole stands disrupted. For many developing countries it is a tragic tale of economic stagnation  with falling living standards and negative growth rates. Adverse socio-economic consequences of these developments have led to social and political unrest. The prospects for growth and development for many of us remain increasingly unfavourable. If the developing countries are to break out of this vicious circle  there has to be a revitalization of the development process. This will be possible only in an international economic environment that is supportive of such efforts.The assessment of the world economy which emerges from the World Economic Survey 1987 is clear. World economic growth  as the Survey points out  is weak and fragile  and the prevailing uncertainties point downwards. It is equally clear that if the negative influences are not reversed in time  they could move the world economy closer to a global recession. Therefore  the urgent imperative is for the launching of policies and measures towards the stimulation of world economic growth. This has to be accompanied by an effective reinvigoration of development and trade on the basis of international economic co-operation.The present modest economic recovery in the industrialized countries has slowed down further in the last two years. The macro-economic and deflationary policies pursued by them in recent years are responsible for this underlying situation. They have had only negative consequences for the third world  as they have precipitated protectionist policies  restrictive trade measures and a decline in third world exports. The situation relating to commodities is critical and prices have slumped since 1980 to their lowest levels in the last 50 years. What is more  there are little signs of an improvement. Several developing countries  such as Sri Lanka   which face huge losses in export earnings as a result of falling commodity prices ; and the deterioration in the terms of trade  find their development efforts seriously disturbed.There is  however  a silver lining to the present gloomy situation and there is the increasing realization by the major market-economy countries of the need for greater co-ordination of their macro-economic policies and recognition of the interlinkages of issues of commodities  trade  monetary and financial policies. This awareness must be seized and broadened and deepened. The notion of Interdependence will have to be transformed into a global and co-ordinated approach reinforced by concrete policies and actions.It is heartening  therefore  that recent developments have recognized the need to address common concerns in a mutually beneficial way on the basis of International economic co-operation. At Punta del Este in September last year Ministers from developed and developing countries alike adopted a bold and ambitious agenda in launching the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. That was aimed at a greater liberalization of world trade and the strengthening of the international trading system. Again  as recently as July his year  in Geneva  the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) adopted by consensus the Final Act of that Conference. The decision represents a political commitment by the international community to work towards the revitalization of development  growth and international trade through multilateral co-operation. It remains for the International community collectively to honour commitments that have been undertaken and to implement them faithfully and effectively.Before turning to the international political and security situation I should like to refer briefly to the current situation in Sri Lanka. Last year I detailed the efforts of President Jayewardene to resist a threat to impose a separate State unacceptable to the vast majority of the people in Sri Lanka. I also detailed the endeavours of the Government to reach a negotiated political settlement with the Tamil community to redress their grievances. Today I am able to state that a new situation has been brought into existence by the signing of the India-Sri Lanka accord in July this year. The wisdom and statesmanship that led to that accord have been widely acclaimed both within and outside the Assembly. Today  terrorism is virtually at an end  with only some sporadic in-fighting between rival terrorist groups which have not yet surrendered all their weapons. Negotiations have been almost completed on the question of the devolution of political and administrative functions to the provincial councils. There will be an interim administration for the Northern and Eastern Provinces pending the transfer of responsibilities to an elected provincial council. A referendum will take place a year thereafter to ascertain the wishes of the people of the Eastern Province on the question of a merger with the Northern Province. We are hopeful that violent divisive and separatist tendencies in the Northern and Eastern Provinces will give way to the democratic process which has nourished Sri Lanka's political life for over half a century.The year 1987 was designated by the United Nations General Assembly the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless on a proposal made by the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka in this Assembly in 1982. As a consequence we have witnessed impressive programmes of national and international activities to focus attention on the problem of adequate housing and to formulate enduring solutions aimed at satisfying a basic need. On 12 October the Assembly will devote two plenary meetings to the observance of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.We see hopeful signs in the international political situation. We welcome the proposed summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union  The agreement in principle to dismantle intermediate-range nuclear forces signals the removal of an entire class of weapons of a particular range from the arsenals of the major military Powers. The threat of global extinction has not  by any means been removed  or even substantially reduced. Yet agreement is in the course of being reached on intermediate-range nuclear forces and its positive impact on the international scene make this perhaps the most significant step of the century in disarmament initiatives.Despite the easing of tension in many sensitive areas  much more remains to be achieved before we can enjoy the fruits of lasting peace and security. The horrific destructive power of nuclear weapons must itself be destroyed and a genuine process of disarmament under adequate verification must be set in motion. The nexus between disarmament and development was explored barely a fortnight а з by an International Conference held under the aegis of the United Nations. The Conference reached the clear conclusion that disarmament and development are the two pillars on which enduring international peace and security can be built and that an arms race and a more sustainable world order are not compatible. There is no denying the complexity of the issues involved  but the high-level political participation in the International Conference was indicative of our collective willingness to address those complexities and to find solutions through multilateral co-operation. Next year we shall- gather in New York again for the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. That session must not slide back from the achievements of the f lest special session on disarmament.Sri Lanka had the honour and privilege of introducing in the Assembly in 1977  on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  the resolution calling for the convening of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. The rationale of special sessions of the General Assembly on disarmament is that the imperative of disarmament affects  not only the nuclear-weapon States and those who have military muscle  but all nations.	.Nuclear disaster would make no distinction between those who can use these weapons  those who possess them  and those like us who do not fall into either category. The joint acceptance by the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union of the fact that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought  needs now to be translated into further reductions and the elimination of nuclear weapons beyond the intermediate nuclear forces. As an interim measure  negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear test ban should be conducted not only bilaterally but multilaterally as well. The Conference on Disarmament can be brought into service to negotiate the necessary agreements. This multilateral negotiating body has demonstrated its capacity in its efforts this year to complete a draft convention on chemical weapons.Few ages have faced such frightening challenges. To retreat from the nuclear race requires greater courage than to persist in a contest to exhibit military superiority. To extend this rivalry and to put weapons in outer space is to thwart the powerful development potential of the last frontier of mankind. Sri Lanka hopes to continue with other nations its efforts to reach consensus on a resolution that would help to prevent an arms race and to promote peaceful co-operation in outer space in the interest of all humanity.Another initiative in disarmament and international security in which Sri Lanka has been engaged is the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We have offered to host one of the Ad Hoc Committee meetings in Colombo next year. This meeting is of course to be distinguished from the Colombo Conference on the Indian Ocean  which is now scheduled to take place by 1990. There is another area of marine activity  economic in character  in which Sri Lanka has taken an initiative. I am happy to state that early this year  we hosted in Colombo the Ministerial Meeting on Indian Ocean Marine Affaire Co-operation. The Conference formulated a long-term programme of co-operation and a plan of action to provide a basis for concrete co-operative action among the Indian Ocean States. The Ministerial Meeting also set up the 17-nation Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Standing Committee  which held its first meeting immediately after the Ministerial Conference. The second meeting of the Standing Committee was concluded successfully early this month in Colombo.We derive considerable satisfaction from the progress achieved so far by the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) for promoting regional co-operation. The agreement reached in identifying terrorist offences for the purpose of extradition is indeed a significant breakthrough. The Bangalore Summit Declaration recogni2ed the importance of the principle that each member State of SAARC should not permit the use of its territory for terrorist activities by terrorist groups against another member State. The last Ministerial Meeting held in New Delhi mandated a group of legal experts from SAARC countries to draft a regional convention on terrorism. I am happy to state that the group of legal experts who met in Sri Lanka this month have formulated a draft convention on terrorism which will now come up for consideration before the Council of Ministers in Kathmandu  early in November this year.A call has been made for an international conference to seek a just and lasting solution to the problems of the Middle East. The fate of an entire people  the Palestinians  continues to be in jeopardy  it is our view that until Israel withdraws from Palestine and other Arab territories it occupies  and until the rights of the Palestinians are restored  no lasting settlement to the cluster of issues known as question of the Middle East can be achieved. Sri Lanka will continue to support the just struggle of the people of Palestine under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization  whose participation is indispensable in the negotiations for a durable settlement. The Arab Peace Plan adopted in Fez in 1982 continues to be relevant in this regard.The plight of the people of Lebanon has become a part of the Middle East question. Sri Lanka calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon to permit the sovereign exercise by the Government of its authority over all its territory.In the adjacent Gulf region  relations between two fellow members of the non-aligned countries  Iran and Iraq  have deteriorated into a wasteful war  which exacts a terrible toll on their peoples. Regional stability has been affected and there looms the threat of a wider conflict. Sri Lanka welcomes the initiative leading to the visit by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the area  and supports every effort to find a settlement acceptable to both parties.The Central American region presents no less a tangled web of issues  which can only be complicated further by unwarranted foreign intervention. The Guatemala Accord  a regional initiative  offers a blueprint for the construction of a solid edifice of peace. We hope that the initiative will lead to stable relationships among the countries concerned on the basis of sovereign equality  mutual respect  and the peaceful coexistence of differing political and economic systems. The international community must appreciate the wishes of the Governments of this region and respect their desire to develop their societies politically and economically in accordance with the aspirations of their peoples. Closer home  the situation in South-East Asia has been adversely affected by developments in Kampuchea. South-West Asia likewise has been affected by developments in Afghanistan. In both situations  Sri Lanka has consistently called for the withdrawal of foreign troops and affirmed the right of the peoples in the respective countries to resolve their problems and determine their political destiny without outside interference  pressures  subversion or coercion. Sri Lanka supports the desire of the Korean people to reunify their homeland peacefully  through direct dialogue  without foreign interference and in conformity with the principles of the North-South Statement of 4 July 1972.Foreign troops have occupied a portion of the Republic of Cyprus  bringing about a de facto division of the island and exacerbating the internal issues concerning the relationship between the two communities in the Republic of Sri Lanka fully supports the call of the Heads of State of the Non-Aligned Movement for the immediate withdrawal of all occupation forces as an essential basis for the solution of the Cyprus problem.The situation in South Africa offers a curious mix of the best and the worst in human endeavour. Racial bigotry that has been cynically institutionalised and piously justified in the system of apartheid displays the worst in man. What inspires us in this otherwise bleak situation is the spirit and determination of the majority people of South Africa to resist oppression  to endure suffering and overcome subjugation. Repression has only strengthened their resistance and reinforced their drive for freedom and majority rule. Comprehensive mandatory sanctions are internationally accepted as the most effective means to dismantle the ugly system of apartheid. Sri Lanka reiterates the call for the release of Nelson Mandela and others so that they can be brought into the mainstream of political life.Apartheid has also kept Namibia captive. What is particularly tragic is the in this situation to the international consensus that would bring independence for Namibia - Security Council resolution 435 (1978) - has not been Implemented. South Africa's strategy to buy time has prevented freedom for Namibia. The obstacle to Namibian independence remains South Africa's intransigence. The courageous struggle of the people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa people's Organization (SWAPO) must reach its inevitable conclusion/ and the international community must hasten this process.Beyond South Africa and Namibia  apartheid has spawned unbearable horrors on the front-line States  such as the massacre of civilians in Mozambique earlier this year. We strongly condemn these actions that seek to destabilize independent countries through such cold-blooded acts of terrorism against innocent civilians.Every year we gather here in New York to examine the international situation and to consider what our collective wisdom has to offer in dealing with issues of common concern to us. Pessimists may say that we are cataloguing failures of the United Nations and indulging in rhetoric. The measure of success or failure of the United Nations will depend on what we  the Members of the United Nations  would wish the Organization to be. For small non-aligned countries like Sri Lanka  the moral authority of the United Nations and its Charter and the international accountability it entails are important bulwarks of our security and independence.Recent developments in some areas have augured well  if not decisively bringing about solutions  at least offering in their wake promises for the future. Patient efforts over a sustained period have had a beneficial cumulative effect  ushering in new hopes  nurturing fresh optimism and yielding new avenues to overcome the failures of the past. These efforts must continue within the framework of the United Nations if decisions ate to command the confidence of the international community and to stand the test of time."
"86",4201,"LSO",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of our delegation and on our own behalf  we wish to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session. We are confident that under your wise leadership - like that of your able predecessors - the Assembly will live up to its commitment.Our profound tribute and gratitude go also to your immediate predecessor  Mr. Humayan Rasheed Choudhury  who led the deliberations of the forty-first session so splendidly last year.We also wish to pay a special and fitting tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts in managing the complicated and difficult affairs of the United Nations  and for his frequent missions of peace to areas of international conflict  which his high office must constantly monitor and try to resolve - and there are still too many areas of conflict for out general safety and comfort.The issues of war have almost imposed themselves on the yearly agenda of this Organization. That is because war is incompatible with man's mission on Earth or even the purpose for which he was created. Today man requires peace more than ever before  as modern technology has refined the instruments of war and increased their capacity to inflict maximum destruction. For man to enjoy the total benefits of peace  the United Nations must be given both the financial and the political means it so greatly requires in order to halt potential conflict situations before they erupt into catastrophes. Only when there is peace can the noble mission of the Organization - to fight the perennial enemies of mankind: hunger  disease  ignorance and homelessness - be realized. The protection and promotion of human rights and the guaranteeing of the dignity of man form the corner-stone of the social  economic and political mission with which the United Nations is charged.We have come to the United Nations General Assembly once again to renew our faith in the noble ideals of the Organization and to reaffirm our commitment to the principles of its Charter. We find it  therefore  fitting for us to call upon those Member States which have consistently violated the goals of the United Nations and its Charter by either deliberately refusing to comply with the Organization's decisions or obstructing its missions for peace to reconsider their position seriously. The result of these violations has been a general perception of the United Nations as an ineffective organization  particularly in the field of international and regional conflicts. The public apathy towards the Organization itself continues unabated  as if it is the fault of the Organization itself and not of the few powerful permanent members of the Security Council that place their national interest above everything else.Where interference with United Nations decisions is minimized  successes have been eminent  particularly in the areas of health  education and other activities carried out by the specialized agencies. The United Nations needs the full financial and political backing of all Member States  particularly in its efforts to promote peace  disarmament and a generally more equitable international order. We are very mindful of the fact that the world political situation has not improved much since two years ago  when we had the honour of coming to the rostrum to address the General Assembly. The tendency to resolve disputes by force still persists; the world political map has been dotted with at least 150 local wars since 1945. These conflicts have claimed millions of lives more than were claimed in the last two world wars - and that about sums up the sorry state of our world today.Allow us to put before this body some of the serious afflictions currently facing Lesotho and the southern African region as a whole.Lesotho is a small country  entirely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa  and - like most small developing countries - still in receipt of much-needed foreign aid. Because of this precarious geographical position  coupled with this dependency on foreign aid  Lesotho - like most small States - is exposed to considerable problems in coining to a forum such as this one and taking the rightful liberty freely to state its case  concerns  plight  and dilemmas  all of which we feel we desperately need to bring to the attention of the Assembly. As we all know  the kind of problems which small nations face in stating their concerns freely should not exist  because one of the basic and fundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter is to provide a platform for the voice of all Member States to be heard and to provide an arena for small nations  especially  to mix and participate with bigger nations free from fear of retaliatory consequences. Despite that basic principle  Lesotho and all other small States are subject to considerable external pressures to conform with the wishes and the interests of those to whom they are supposedly beholden and either say nothing or say only that which will please and is required of them.History has placed us in a geographical and economic situation such that we are completely surrounded by one country  the Republic of South Africa  a situation that is unique to Lesotho. We have watched from within the political scenario as it has been evolving  from 1910  when there was a call for a national convention to determine the future of that country and the participation of all in its administration  to the present day  when the social  economic  racial and political conflicts have developed into a violent confrontation. As a neighbour of South Africa and a member of the international body of nations  we have witnessed with growing concern and anxiety the developments in that country and the rest of our subregion. A correct political direction in 1910  guaranteeing the accommodation of the majority black South Africans in the aspirations and political dispensations of the day and rejecting colour as a basis for determining man's worth  would have ensured a happy  non-racial South Africa enjoying a healthy economic and political development. That is what could have happened.The current situation is that all the countries of the subregion are engaged in a bitter struggle for a happy and prosperous future for southern Africa. For the States members of the South African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC)  it is a struggle to protect their sovereignty and territorial integrity  to build up development strategies that will ensure their sustainable economies  dependent on collective security. It is a struggle whose central causes  whose enormous costs in terms of human misery  human degradation and human life  are often obscured and even distorted by other international interests  concerns and priorities. It is a struggle that is surely one of the most urgent and outstanding moral issues of our time to face the Assembly. Its outcome will have profound consequences  not only for us in southern Africa  but for Africa as a whole. It is a struggle that the international community - if it has the political will  for the capacity is there - could bring to a just and early conclusion  both to shorten the suffering it causes and to prevent the consequences of the alternative  which is protracted  violent struggle wherein the peace and political and economic stability of southern Africa could pass beyond the reach of all of us for many years to come.Lesotho's geographical position exposes it to peculiar challenges to its national and territorial integrity  to its freedom of action and to its right to seek more self-reliant  self-sustaining development. Those challenges  and their consequences for the rights of small nations as sovereign States  only serve to increase our sense of unity with those who are struggling for the human rights  human dignity and justice that have long since been secured  valued and respected y most of the big  wealthy and powerful nations. In carrying out our obligations under the various international conventions we shall abide strictly by the terms id conditions therein prescribed. We shall  therefore  expect all concerned to >-operate fully with us in their discharge.Our sense of commitment  sometimes coupled with frustration in the face of the :elites of Lesotho's position  serves only to commit us more deeply to the cause of the majority in South Africa  our brothers and sisters  our neighbours and friends. Our policies are and will remain one with those embodied in the United Nations Charter  in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international covenants on human rights  all of which prohibit racism and all forms of degrading discriminatory systems based on power  wealth and political manipulations. We are also committed to the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement  to the principles that underpin the Freedom Charter and to the African Charter of Human and People's Rights  whose preamble recognizes the duty of all African States to do whatever is in their power to secure the elimination of apartheid and all that it stands for.The costs - in terms of human life  human suffering and human degradation – of the conflict raging in our region  and the cost of destabilization  far outweigh the costs that would be felt by all of us if apartheid were to be dismantled and abolished immediately. Apart from the inestimable costs in human life  the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference estimated that in the years 1980 to 1984 the destabilization of our economies cost SADCCs member States $US 12 000 million  $US 4 000 million of that total being the result of direct war damage. Those costs continue to rise  outstripping the total amount of foreign aid given to our States. This kind of cost  to nations that desperately need to focusall their resources and energies on their economic development for self-reliance and the abolition of poverty  actually prevents any such development  while also undermining our credibility at home and abroad. The extensive economic potential of our region therefore remains undeveloped  and we continue to suffer from both overt and covert economic sanctions and political blackmail.Today we appeal to all the members of the Assembly actively and urgently to begin to seek the most effective means of helping all of us in southern Africa to begin to lay the foundations for a happier  new  post-apartheid order based on those principles the Assembly cherishes and has enshrined. We would therefore ask for immediate international support for the SADCC countries through the development of stronger relations and active programmes and strategies intended to lessen unnecessary dependency  to develop SADCC1 s collective security and to promote self-reliant  sustainable economies. If the international community supported such goals while actively deterring all efforts of destabilization against our countries  such support would be yet one more peaceful measure to bring about the desired changes for all of us in the region. For Lesotho  whose economic and political future will depend on its membership in SADCC and the effective help we get through it  it is our only chance to secure the political  economic and national integrity so vital to preserve and strengthen our national identity.In addition to SADCC  there is much to be gained by supporting our commitment to the Non-Aligned Movement. The securing of true peace and freedom from military threats and economic blackmail can only bring genuine political and economic stability to our region. If the basic principles of the Non-Aligned Movement are objectively examined  one concludes that there are no real dangers in alignment with such principles. Africa is looking for its own political and social forms of organization based on a combination of indigenous factors of custom and culture and 41 world values. Whether it is for the present SADCC members or for our brothers id sisters in South Africa and Namibia  a strong human-rights posture by all the members of the Assembly can only enhance the prospects for peaceful transformation n southern Africa as a whole and South Africa in particular.As we stand here today  we humbly appeal to the Assembly to re-examine the issues at stake in the light of the new realities and the new dangers of the present time and to seek to secure the undoubted influence of international pressure to negotiate  now  for a settlement that will bring true peace and genuine security to southern Africa because we may not have such an opportunity for a long time to come. We wish this Assembly to recognize that it is no longer a question of whether apartheid should be dismantled and abolished  for we in southern Africa are talking about how it will be abolished  about when it will be abolished  on whose timetable it will happen  and with what kind of outside involvement and help it will happen. It is therefore vital for all of us in southern Africa that the international community see these realities of our present struggle not in terms of any East-West conflict and not in terms of ideologies or alignments.There is a crucial  central interdependence of all the nations and races in such a resource-rich region as southern Africa. The economic experience and expertise of any one group will always be needed  as will the active partnership and skills of the other groups  in moving towards economic prosperity and stability that can only be to the advantage of all of us. We are all faced with a situation that cannot be compared with the post-colonial era  which involved the departure of one nation or ruler. We have all come to know and accept for many years now that ultimately we shall all have to learn to live together  or we shall perish together. No one will be required to leave  for we all recognize that we need each other; and those in the majority groups hope that those in the minority groups will stay  and not feel threatened or swamped. But such a state of affairs can come about only by means of a common citizenship for all and a universal franchise based on agreed formulas and a carefully worked out system of participation  sharing and representation that safeguards the rights of all.This is no wild dream; it is a vital and urgent necessity  and we seek the active co-operation of the international community to ensure that negotiations on such a transition take place in the very near future. It will not be easy  but it is the only solution if we are to avoid alternatives all too terrible either to contemplate or to allow. Because of our very peculiar and vulnerable situation in the region  Lesotho has to make a special appeal for recognition of its special position and its special political and economic needs· We desperately need more specific international help to enable us to achieve a degree of self-reliance - economic and political - in order to lessen our dependence  the degree of which at present renders us most vulnerable and inhibits and distorts our genuine efforts towards strengthening  protecting  and defending our sovereignty and national integrity. We have the will  but at present our means are inadequate  hence our special appeal.Today the world is dotted with flash-points of tension and conflict. The peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan have for many years now been the victims of war and painful occupation. Lesotho  being a small country that has suffered from war and territorial dispossession in its history  abides strictly by the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. We therefore believe that we stand on higher moral ground when we request the withdrawal of foreign troops from those countries and many others throughout the world so that their peoples can enjoy peace. We request that their sovereignty and non-aligned status be respected by all.The suffering of the Palestinian people and the people of Lebanon has been mg and painful. It is obvious that rhetoric has not brought much comfort to the Palestinian people. The Middle East situation now requires bold and imaginative initiatives by all the parties concerned. These initiatives should be geared towards bringing about an international conference on the Middle East situation in which all the parties to the conflict participate on an equal footing and without pre-conditions. The right of Israel to exist as a sovereign State with recognized and secure borders and the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland of their own and ultimately to independence and sovereignty are essential elements of a lasting and peaceful solution of the Middle East crisis.It would be remiss of us not to express our strong concern about the present situation in the Gulf. The fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq has been allowed to go on for too long  regardless of the cause. Some of us have watched helplessly for years now as two Islamic countries  bound together by traditions of culture  religion and beliefs and Members of the United Nations  have deployed the scarce resources at their disposal to destroy one another.The destruction of economic infrastructure and the disruption of shipping in the area continue unabated. As in all wars today  the outside Powers are deeply involved. Today  the outside Powers seek the imposition by the Security Council of sanctions against Iran. To us the imposition of sanctions is tantamount to a declaration of war on another front.We fully support Security Council resolution 598 (1987)   calling for a cease-fire in this conflict that has caused so much loss of life and destruction of property. We followed with great hope the mission of the Secretary-General to that troubled area. No effort should be spared to bring lasting peace to those two nations  with which my own country enjoys fraternal relations.We have been greatly encouraged by the recent agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of medium-range missiles in Western Europe. This significant development should be applauded  for it signifies a thaw in the relations between the two super-Powers and a marked reduction in East-West tension.We can hardly draw any comfort from the state of the world economic situation  especially as it affects developing countries. The most serious setback to economic development in developing countries has been the alarming levels and accelerated rates of net transfers of financial resources from developing to developed countries. The increasing debt crisis of developing countries  which is far from being resolved  remains the most severe strain on economic growth. This  coupled with the performance of world trade  whereby the developed nations are applying restrictive macro-economic and trade policies  has resulted in the most unpromising economic situation for us in the third world.The current international economic situation has been brought about by the economic and financial order of the present day  which is obviously highly unjust. Being among the least developed of the developing countries  Lesotho is committed to the resumption at the earliest possible date of the stalled North-South dialogue. We also believe that meaningful global economic negotiations are bound to lessen international tensions and insecurities. We therefore call upon the developed nations to show a more positive attitude.We are aware that the recent International Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development has drawn very encouraging and useful conclusions  which we hope will be regarded as such by all concerned. We have always felt that too many valuable resources are being wasted on rearmament and the production of weapons of mass destruction  resources which could be deployed more usefully for socio-economic development in order to lessen the gap between the developed and the developing nations."
"87",4271,"LUX",42,1987,"﻿First of all. Sir  I should like to take this opportunity to offer you my congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your long experience in diplomacy and international relations and your personal talent are great assets that assure us of your enlightened and vigorous conduct of this session's proceedings.I should also like to express my gratitude and admiration to the Secretary-General. With dedication  wisdom and tenacity  and assisted by outstanding associates  he has performed year after year the delicate and complex tasks entrusted to him. At a time when certain world and regional conflicts have entered a critical phase  his initiatives and his efforts at mediation and conciliation have taken on a special importance. I need refer only to the Iran-Iraq war and the occupation of Afghanistan. I want to say how very pleased my Government is that his mandate has been renewed and assure him once again of all our confidence.Last Tuesday  Mr. Ellemann-Jensen  the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs  addressed the Assembly as the current President of the European Community and its 12 member States. I entirely endorse the positions he expounded here on the various international questions in today's world  and shall therefore confine my remarks to the following observations.The review of the international situation in which we traditionally engage at this time of year leads us on this occasion to make an assessment that is more subtle and  indeed  more positive. We are  of course  still disturbed to see that confrontation and military occupation persist in various parts of the world. There are new outbursts of violence  and breaches of human rights are still as widespread as ever. At the same time  a majority of member countries continue to endure the hardships inflicted by the state of the world economy. However  a number of recent developments appear to indicate a more positive turn and  indeed  to justify new hopes. I have in mind  in particular  the situation in Central America  to which I shall revert later  and the situation in Sri Lanka  where a balanced agreement has been signed between the President of Sri Lanka and the Prime Minister of India providing for a conclusion to the bloody war that has been waged between that country's two communities. I should also mention the very encouraging results of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  which has just completed its work at Geneva. I would be remiss if I did not reiterate our common commitment to the fight against terrorism. Glimmers of hope have appeared with regard to the possibility of convening a Middle East peace conference. The emerging consensus in the aftermath of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development also demonstrates a new state of mind and greater convergence of interests and views. Above all  however  the evolution in East-West relations  in which my country has the greatest interest  situated as it is in the heart of Europe  is a matter that gives ground for new optimism. The question of utmost interest to us is whether international relations have indeed reached a turning point. For the first time it is my impression that we are witnessing the slow demise of the cold war and the old dogmas that have characterised post war political dogmas based on the dialectic of the world class struggle  unrelenting confrontation between ideologies  hostility and fundamental distrust between blocks. The desire to avoid nuclear disaster  to guarantee the survival of mankind and to offer prosperity to the greatest possible number is  I believe compelling peoples  and consequently their political leaders  to do some clear thinking. No one can deny that in our day the development of modern technology and the continual internationalisation of production and trade have led to interdependence among economies and States· It is only natural and realistic for political leaders of whatever persuasion to recognize the situation and resolutely and without ulterior motives adopt a policy that will bring about the conditions necessary for broader  more creative and mutually advantageous co-operation. For the present  our attention is focused on the prospects for the first real disarmament agreement  concerning intermediate nuclear forces  which should be concluded before the end of the year. This has in particular resulted from a fortunate initiative of NATO  dating from 1981  It is therefore with keen hope that we look forward to the formalization of the next summit  which should result in the signing of this historic agreement. Such an agreement would bring about a decisive strengthening of the climate of trust and the spirit of co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union  between East and West. It would help reduce tensions to the lowest level known by Europe since the end of the Second World War. It is our hope that in the wake of that initial agreement  which is of vital importance politically and psychologically negotiations on a drastic reduction of strategic nuclear forces will also be completed. In the same spirit  we very much hope that the work of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva - where many hurdles have been overcome - on the prohibition and elimination of all chemical weapons will be completed promptly. From the same standpoint of the need for stability and increased security in Europe  my country also advocates parallel negotiations on conventional forces  which we hope will lead to a balanced reduction  also properly verifiable  of such armaments. The need further to enhance the spirit of trust and co-operation requires that in the mean time existing treaties and agreements be complied with and that the establishment and development of new categories of intra- or extra-atmospheric weapons not be encouraged  for they would only create additional confusion in the already highly complex technical rivalry and would put the arms race on a new and entirely different path.It is with pleasure that we note the new directions of Soviet domestic and foreign policy. During my recent trip to Moscow I had the privilege of speaking to important Soviet leaders  and I came away believing that a change in policy really is under way. This should help bring about profound and lasting progress in all spheres  in particular respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  which many justifiably expect. In this context I would recall and emphasize our political will to act with our partners in the European Community so that the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will lead to the total implementation by all participant countries of the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act. Just as we feel entitled to consider the implications of recent developments in international relations  so we must make it clear that only actions - not resolutions - will remove the doubts and reservations that history and experience have rooted within us. In this regard  the increasingly murderous war in Afghanistan causes serious doubts to persist as to the Soviet desire for peace in its foreign policy. How can it be otherwise  while foreign troops remain stationed there and prevent the Afghan people from fully exercising their right to self-determination and to build a new society that is truly non-aligned and independent? Only the rapid withdrawal of those troops according to a precise timetable will make possible progress in the talks being held by the Secretary-General.	The agreement on a plan for the restoration of peace in Central America  reached on 7 August by the five Presidents of Central America  is another source ι : satisfaction to us. Luxembourg  acting together with the other member countries ( E the European Community  has constantly advocated a negotiated settlement  particularly at Ministerial Conferences at which its representatives have met with those of the Central American countries and the Contadora Group - first in San Joś in 1984  then in Luxembourg in 1985  and  recently  in Guatemala in February of this year. Resisting outside pressures and demonstrating a common political will  the Heads of those five nations have given the world a lesson in courage and political wisdom by saying no to any armed solution and choosing peace through a negotiated regional agreement based on dialogue  reconciliation and democracy. The first steps towards implementation of the peace process  which is certainly as difficult and delicate as any process ever has been  are encouraging and consolidate the restored climate of trust. It is therefore desirable that all countries involved in the region accept that agreement and contribute to its conversion into a genuine peace with due respect for international law. In two countries of East Asia which have for too long been subject to oppression and dictatorship  democracy has also been given a chance. In the Philippines  President Aquino has worked with determination to establish institutions truly representative of the people of the Philippines. She deserves our support as she moves along this road  which is strewn with formidable dangers. Her efforts to bring about economic recovery  to curb corruption  and to carry out the necessary social and economic reforms  particularly agrarian reform  deserve our esteem. In the Philippines  Latin America and elsewhere  success in the attainment of democracy is closely linked to the bold measures required for progress and social justice  of which those countries have so long been deprived. In South Korea  an intelligent people has succeeded in securing recognition of the legitimacy of its political and social demands  thus opening the way to political amnesty  freedom of expression and free elections. We are pleased that  as the Seoul Olympic Games draw near  this process is helping bring about a truly democratic regime through the responsible contribution of all parties concerned  including the present Government and the leaders of the opposition. The absence of any representative of the Korean people in this Hall thus deserves to be re-examined at this session. On the Question of the war between Iran and Iraq  we wish to welcome the unanimous agreement reached in the Security Council  based on an identical assessment by the five permanent members of the Security Council. This is an encouraging sign which is promising for the future of the United Nations. It signals a new trend which deserves to be highlighted and sustained. That decision proves that all the members of the Security Council  diverse as they are  are capable of finding a common political will and of shouldering the special responsibilities that the Charter and the Members of this Organization have entrusted to them for the maintenance of international peace and security. Even though this diplomatic breakthrough cannot erase from our minds the suffering of the war  we should like  from this rostrum  to applaud this magnificent precedent  achieved with a unanimity unparalleled in recent history  which should enable East and West  North and South  to work more resolutely an on a larger scale towards the restoration of international peace and co-operator It is my firm belief that the great majority of the Members of the United Nations expect to see the Council  in keeping with the spirit of the Charter  examine with equal determination other important questions and other acute conflicts that have been too long neglected. It is true that Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  of 20 July  hasn’t yet brought peace. But that only shows that that while the agreement of the Council is certainly indispensable in order to stop the conflict  it is not yet necessarily sufficient. In fact  the war is continuing  more destructive than ever. More than seven years of armed aggression have resulted in the death a 3 injury of more than a million civilians or military personnel  most of them innocent young people  whole cities have been laid waste by attacks from the air and incessant bombardments. There has been repeated use of chemical weapons  inflicting atrocious suffering  in flagrant violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925. We should unreservedly condemn their use. The war is tearing apart two peoples who are the heirs of ancient and outstanding civilizations. It has sown disquiet and caused social divisions in a number of Arab countries  and even beyond the Arab world. Because of the risks that it might spread - the tragic incidents in Mecca are proof of that - the conflict now threatens international freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf  requiring the intervention of friendly and allied countries to safeguard free passage in those International sea lanes. I join all those who have expressed encouragement of the Secretary-General's action  which is continuing  in close consultation with the Security Council  with the aim of securing acceptance by the two parties of the Security Council resolution  which alone is capable of leading to a comprehensive  just and honourable settlement. The call for the holding of an international conference on the Middle East has created a momentum which returns to the United Nations the initiative in the search for a comprehensive solution. It has become evident that this is the only forum capable of setting in motion and successfully completing a genuine peace process in the region. My country  with the other member States of the Community  supports such a conference. The consultations conducted by the Secretary-General with all the parties concerned and with the members of the Security Council strengthen our belief that holding an international peace conference under United Nations auspices has now gained an increasingly broad measure of support  as there is no alternative to a negotiated solution. We hope that the consultations will be continued and intensified. The twelve States members of the Community have several times set out the principles on which a just and comprehensive solution should be based. I refer in particular to the Declaration they made in Venice in 1988. It was based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which set forth in particular the principle of withdrawal from all the territories occupied during the 1967 conflict. The Declaration also emphasizes the principle of the right to existence and security of all States in the region  particularly the State o Israel  as well as equality of treatment for all peoples  which implies recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. I am convinced that the remaining resistance  in Israel and elsewhere  з the idea of this international conference will eventually be overcome  and that consequently the chance of a negotiated settlement will at long last be take. However  we view with the gravest concern the present situation in Lebanon  a country that has been bled dry and torn apart by 10 years of civil war and f reign occupation. The regular eruption of violence continues relentlessly  with I s macabre procession of bombardments  hostage-taking  massacre of innocents  a d inter-communal strife. Only by ensuring reconciliation between its different communities will Lebanon be able to recover its sovereignty  unity  independence and territorial integrity. Like the Secretary-General  I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  which  in Lebanon as elsewhere  continuing to supervise - despite a heavy toll of dead and Injured - the separation of the parties concerned and the maintenance of a truce which  in the absence of a definitive settlement  continues to be precarious. In South Africa the situation continues to be extremely serious and explosive. The white minority Government is committed to maintaining the system of apartheid  which is in many ways a cause of shame to mankind. Since the elections of 6 May all the promises of reform seem to have been forgotten. There is no sign of any fundamental change  and no willingness to engage in dialogue has emerged. The state of emergency continues· Thousands of people remain in detention without trial censorship is constantly being intensified. Externally  South Africa rides roughshod over the sovereignty of neighbouring countries. It is continuing the illegal occupation of Namibia. My Government unreservedly condemns this policy and these actions of South Africa.In 1985  under the presidency of Luxembourg  and again in 1986 the countries of the European Community enacted a number of measures designed to punish the Pretoria Government for its repressive policy towards the black majority. Those measures are reviewed and where appropriate strengthened in the light of developments in the situation. The Assembly and the Security Council should act likewise. Above all  the international community should respond to the desire to retain apartheid not with ineffective steps and disunity  but with a determination to demand its total and irreversible elimination. The pressure of the international community must also be brought to bear unrelentingly to end the flagrant and systematic violations of human rights in many other countries. Here I refer in particular to the situation in Chile  whose people have now been unjustly deprived of democracy  freedom and fundamental human rights for 14 years. The world economic situation continues to give rise to grave concern. Wherever one looks  economic growth is still slow and inadequate. The world's gross domestic product grew by only 3 per cent in 1986  and prospects for 1987 and later are not much better  especially in view of the 1.6 per cent per annum growth of world population. In the northern hemisphere - that is  in the industrialized countries - the situation is in most cases reflected by the persistence of high rates of unemployment  marked external imbalances and  here and there  profound and painful restructuring. In the Southern hemisphere  we note that development has been severely hindered by a number of factors; exceptionally low and unstable commodity prices  a deterioration in exchange terms  a drop in export earnings  increasingly crushing debt servicing  and obstacles to trade. In addition  adjustment policies often cause a worsening of already precarious living conditions  particularly for the most deprived sectors of the people of those countries. Generally speaking  the gap between the developed and the developing countries is becoming wider rather than narrower. In particular  the per capita income in the industrialized countries - both East and West - grew by about 3.5 per cent in 1986  whereas it declined by about 4 per cent in the developing countries. Of course  all those percentages are average figures; that tends to blur not only the disparities between countries but also the inequalities within many countries themselves. Given that gloomy picture  the countries that took part in the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII)  held two months ago in Geneva  reached a consensus which I welcome. They proved able to show moderation and realism - I would go so far as to say a new sense of individual and collective responsibility. In that regard  I draw attention to the conduct of the countries with Communist regimes  which  for the first time in history  associated themselves with the analysis of the other participants. In particular  I must emphasize the positive action of the People's Republic of China. That country distinguished itself at UNCTAD VII - as  indeed  it has done in other spheres - by its moderating and constructive efforts  which redounded to the greatest benefit of all the participants. The conclusions reached by that Conference do not of course  provide any miraculous solutions with direct  short-term effects. They do  however  involve the acceptance of fundamental principles which are dictated by the mounting interdependence of economies and respect for which is a pre-condition for the general resumption of growth  development and international trade. It is also to be hoped that the new financial and structural solidarity that is envisaged will be quickly given concrete form and that the commitments entered into by all concerned will be sufficiently precise to make possible the creation of the environment necessary to bring about recovery. The multilateral trade negotiations now going on  which are designed to ensure a greater opening up of markets  will provide an initial response in that regard. Growth is without doubt a necessary condition for the improvement of living standards in all countries  particularly the developing countries. Each of them  of course  must bear the primary responsibility for its own development. None the less  I venture to state that a development policy of some depth must devote equal attention to the effective participation of all the people  the distribution of national income  and the social effects thereof. There are clear reasons of justice for that - and also the fundamental idea that development cannot be imposed. In conclusion  let me state again - if there is really a need to do so - our commitment to the Organization. How can we still doubt that the United Nations system is irreplaceable  when we consider the crucial role played  for example  by the Security Council in such questions as the Iran-Iraq war  the Middle East  Afghanistan and the search for solutions in Cambodia and Cyprus? Can we still afford the luxury of a multilateral crisis when we realize the outstanding service rendered to peace day and night by United Nations forces in various flashpoints around the world? Can we afford the luxury of a crisis at a time when we want to see international action strengthened in order to secure universal respect for human rights? Can we afford the luxury of a crisis when countless economic and ecological challenges make sustained international co-operation more essential with the passing of each day? In that spirit  I would refer to the remarkable report just published by the international Commission presided over by the Norwegian Prime Minister  Mrs  Gro Harlem Brundtland  which shows how very alarming is the state of the world environment as well as its grave consequences for future development. These problems  transcending national boundaries  require deep thought and vigorous action  which can be harmonized only at the international level. It therefore seems to me most desirable to find a solution as soon as possible to the financial crisis of the United Nations  which not only paralyses our work but also undermines confidence. The legal commitments solemnly subscribed to in regard to this Organization  just like the primacy of international law  require this of all of us. The necessary restructuring undertaken by the Secretary-General in implementation of the relevant resolution  which was adopted unanimously  must be encouraged and quickly completed. Forty-two years ago the United Nations was established in America  this welcoming land of democracy where we meet each year with so much pleasure. This time  I have deliberately focused my remarks on the more realistic and more pragmatic new trends in international relations. It is for us  together and in solidarity  to make the United Nations a more coherent  more integrated and better-structured centre where the efforts of all nations to ensure prosperity can be more effectively harmonized. Without this  there cannot be a more secure  and therefore all-encompassing  peace. Finally  I would refer to the annual report on the work of the Organization that the Secretary-General has just submitted to us. I share very broadly the assessment made in it of the serious international problems. I therefore readily endorse the following relevant and deeply poetic words used by the Secretary-General in describing the present international context; “It is as if the sails of the small boat in which all the people of the earth are gathered had caught again  in the midst of a perilous sea  a light but favourable wind. ... [But] our global vessel will need skilful piloting and the assistance of dedicated oarsmen to navigate the many shoals and reach safe landfall in the next century"". (A/42/1  p. 2) "
"88",4344,"MAR",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco I should like  first of all  to express our most sincere and heartfelt congratulations to you. Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We are convinced that at this crucial juncture for the future of our Organization your eminent qualities as a statesman  your long experience and your deep knowledge of the complexity of international relations are great assets for the successful conclusion of our work. Be assured of the full and complete co-operation of the Moroccan delegation  in a spirit of responsibility and pragmatism  in order to respond positively to the hopes of the community of nations for progress at each session of the General Assembly in the cause of peace  stability and harmony among peoples.We take this opportunity to pay warm tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  who carried out his mandate brilliantly during the past session  allowing our Organization to bridge a particularly difficult moment of its history.We must pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who has constantly and tenaciously pursued his praiseworthy efforts to settle the many ongoing conflicts and prevent the emergence of new conflicts. We express our gratitude and pledge firm support for his initiatives.Finally  to Ambassador Joseph Reed  a long-standing friend and former Ambassador of the United States to Morocco  who has recently assumed new duties in United Nations Secretariat  we wish full success  convinced as we are that he will carry out his new functions with the sane dynamism and effectiveness he displayed while in Morocco.It is unsettling to observe that despite the efforts being made by so many men and women of goodwill throughout the world  we continue to have such a disquieting image of the world that the most determined among us could at any time sink into the depths of despair.Wars that could never be justified are raging at the four corners of our planet  the most blatant forms of terrorism are daily expanding to hitherto well-guarded Nations  the disparity between the wealthy and the poor nations is increasing with nothing in sight to break this intolerable cycle.Yet  more than 40 years have elapsed since the creation of the United Nations during that time it has so borne the hopes of all those who believe in a better world that no shortcoming in the present-day world fails to reflect upon our Organization  casting on it a discredit that is often undeserved but that some do not hesitate to stir up for selfish and purely opportunistic motives. The most elementary honesty requires us to proclaim that such discredit is all the more unfair since the United Nations  despite numerous difficulties and hurdles  has in four decades accomplished much for world peace and the advancement of mankind. Nevertheless  the future of our Organization remains very disquieting. Sufficient financial resources and political determination on the part of Member States are too often lacking.A few positive steps have indeed been taken. During the last session the General Assembly adopted resolution 41/213  the purpose of which was to improve the efficiency of the administration and financial functioning of the United Nations. The adoption by consensus of that text was a reflection of the common faith in the Irreplaceable role of our Organization. The Secretary-General has used all the means at his disposal to rationalize working methods  reduce expenditure and increase the efficiency of the Organization. We are therefore justified in formulating the hope that his efforts will receive increased support from Member States  which should show greater respect for their commitments  thereby enabling our Organization to face the changes in the international community and the new challenges of the modern world.The Kingdom of Morocco will remain faithful to all its obligations and do its utmost to further the objectives and increase the credibility of our Organization. It was in that spirit  and in order fully to shoulder its share of responsibility to the international community  that my country this year put forward its candidacy to fill for the next two years the seat on the Security Council allocated to northern Africa  in accordance with the principle of rotation which has always prevailed within the regional groups. We hope thus to have a further opportunity to continue to make our contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security. Many centres of tension persist throughout the world  despite the warnings given and the appeals to reason made every year from this rostrum. The fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  which is now entering its eighth year  continues to spread destruction and suffering among the populations concerned. That war  which every day further depletes the capabilities of the two warring countries  is gravely threatening the future of the whole region by masking the real problems and giving rise to new sources of instability in a geographical area extending from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Arabian-Persian Gulf.In July 1987 the Security Council  in adopting unanimously resolution 598 (1987)  provided a historic opportunity for the restoration of peace and security to the region. The Council followed the path o£ reason and wisdom when it implemented the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter  which are at the core of the whole system of collective security and permit the Council  once the diagnosis of a breach of the peace has been established  to demand the extinction of the fire by the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized borders. That Is a necessary preliminary to any appropriate action to deal with the crisis in all its aspects and to the just  honourable and lasting settlement already called for  unfortunately to no avail  by resolution 514 (1982)  of 12 July 1982.Those compulsory measures  which are ""without prejudice to the rights  claims  or position of the parties"" in the terms of Article 40 of the Charter  should be implemented without delay  to ensure that the credibility of our Organization and the relevance of the key provisions of the Charter are not undermined. We welcome ļ Iraq's acceptance of resolution 598 (1987) and strongly urge Iran to respond to the expectations of the international community as clearly expressed by the unanimous | vote of the members of the Security Council. In that spirit. His Majesty King Hassan II  in a message to the Heads of State and Government of the Islamic community stated the following;""Islam is above all unifying and tolerant and that should be and should remain its mission. We should therefore seek all the available means of strengthening our unitary determination while respecting our diversities."" We pay a tribute once again to the indefatigable and unceasing efforts undertaken in that spirit by the Secretary-General to reconcile the different points of view and create conditions favourable to a constructive dialogue. The fratricidal conflict between Iran and Iraq has overshadowed the Middle East tragedy and the tragic situation of the Palestinian people  who have been subjected for the past 40 years to exile and foreign occupation. The sacrifices made by that people can be measured only by the sufferings and deprivation it has undergone  and nothing can disguise them or silence the poignant appeal for justice to be done - justice in the form of the right to self-determination  to a homeland and to an autonomous State.Is it not an anachronism that the sons of Abraham  the children of a land that is the melting pot of the most flourishing civilization in the history of mankind  should be tearing each other apart  with contempt for the values that are the foundation of their very existence? Is it not time to go back to the path of wisdom and of the future outlined by the regional organizations  such as the Arab League in Fez in 1982 or the United Nations in its many resolutions? The just lasting and global solution of the Israeli-Arab conflict can be found by convening an International conference  with the full and complete participation of all the parties concerned and of the permanent members of the Security Council.The Middle East crisis has engulfed in its turmoil the Lebanese people  which daily experiences the horrors of war and intolerance  whereas it was once a people envied by many  a perfect model of cohabitation and the coexistence of communities and religions. On the basis of its solidarity with the Lebanese people  the Kingdom of Morocco calls for the cessation of all foreign Interference in that country  so that it can undertake the exciting task of reconstruction and regain the bases of national harmony. The seeds of conflict are sown and they germinate each time a people is subjected to foreign domination or to a discriminatory system that assails the dignity and fundamental rights of human beings and is therefore intolerable. That is the reason for the explosive situation imposed by the South African regime upon southern Africa  a situation that threatens the peace and security of the whole continent. While history teaches us that apartheid  which is a blatant challenge to the conscience of humanity  is condemned to disappear ř wisdom requires us to take all the necessary measures to precipitate its fall and thereby save many innocent human lives. It is therefore high time for our Organization to use the complete arsenal of provisions available in the Charter to compel compliance with the Charter's objectives and most essential principles.The Namibian people remain under the domination of apartheid and South African foreign occupation despite the adoption some 10 years ago  of Security Council resolution 437 (1978)  which set forth the United Nations plan for that Territory. The determination of the international community should remain strong if unconditional implementation of that plan in its entirety is to be obtained. The Kingdom of Morocco resolutely stands· by the Namibian people  to which we renew our full support for the realization of their legitimate aspirations to independence and territorial unity·My country  striving to preserve the coexistence of all people and the respect due to the identity of each  has always supported the right of each people to choose its own political  economic and social regime without outside interference. It therefore renews its call for the evacuation of foreign troops from Kampuchea and Afghanistan so as to allow the peoples of those countries freely to decide their destiny. Central America is not absent from our concerns. Thus we support and will continue to support the efforts of the Contadora Group aimed at bringing peace and stability to that region on the basis of non-interference and co-operation among the countries concerned. We earnestly hope that the peace plan put forward by President Arias of Costa Rica and his Central American peers will succeed in fostering harmony among all the countries of the region  to which we are bound by common and deep ties of friendship and co-operation.As a State bordering one of the most important maritime waterways - the Straits of Gibraltar  which links the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean - Morocco understandably closely follows the situation in the Mediterranean. The strategic situation of that maritime waterway and the extremely sensitive character of that area with respect to the peace and security of the entire Mediterranean basin call for special attention to the remaining sources of tension. Morocco is deeply attached to the virtues of dialogue and will pursue its chosen path with persistence and determination in order to solve outstanding disputes through concerted action. The sensitivity  the strategic importance and the vulnerability of the area call for us to combine our energies so that the Mediterranean may become a harbour of peace and prosperity for the countries on its north and south shores.Driven by that conviction  Morocco participated actively in the meeting of non-aligned Mediterranean countries held in Brioni last June  which decided to establish the bases for dialogue between countries of the northern and southern Mediterranean. It was apparent that the security of the Mediterranean cannot be considered separately and that the problems it raises require comprehensive treatment by all the coastal States.In this regard  Morocco notes with satisfaction the agreement in principle reached between the United States and the Soviet Union to remove short- and medium-range missiles from Europe. That represents important progress  that should be extended to include the missiles carried by the fleets in the Mediterranean.Security and development are intimately linked. But while world security continues to preoccupy  it must unfortunately be acknowledged that in the field of development the 1980s is a lost decade. The world economy continues to sink into an unprecedented structural crisis. International trade is undergoing the strongest protectionist pressures since the Great Depression of the 1930s. On the one hand  markets for commodity goods have been experiencing an unparalleled historic set-back for the past 50 years; on the other  the international financial system is threatened by bankruptcy under the pressure of the overwhelming burden of debt. This situation  which translates in real terms into a lower standard of living in developing countries  cannot persist without affecting the stability of those nations  and thus further compromising their development efforts Therefore  the struggle for development is not only the most important economic and social issue of our time; it is also a major political problem confronting the international community. It is thus urgent rapidly to engage in restructuring the world economic environment with a view to replacing the present relations  which are mostly based on domination  with linkages based on interdependence and genuine solidarity among all members of the human race.In this respect the external debt crisis is a major test that may prove fatal if a global approach  based on shared responsibility  is not taken in solving this problem  not only in with regard to its immediate technical and accounting aspects  but also with regard to its longer term political and social implications.It should be realized that in Latin America  as well as in Africa  the excessive burden of external debt servicing has become unbearable  and in many cases a sizeable part of the debt is already irrecoverable. I should like here  in the name of my country  to invite creditors from developed countries to show the necessary political will and a reasonable view of their own interests by lifting their customs barriers  by lowering their subsidies for agricultural exports  by supporting the commodities market and by increasing their public development assistance and ensuring an adequate flow of financial resources to developing countries during the present period of macro-economic restructuring. This endeavour should necessarily lead  on the basis of resolution 41/202 and the Final Document of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  to an agreement on debt-restructuring and new formulas for rescheduling  repayment and terms  including the reduction of real interest rates and the stabilization of exchange rates.In Africa  where many countries still experience chaotic situations  coupled with natural disasters  such as the drought that plagued the countries of the Sahel  the struggle for mere survival has replaced every hope of development. Faced with deterioration in the economic environment  the debt burden and demographic pressures  there are in Africa  according to the World Bank  about 15 countries threatened with outright bankruptcy.Yet 1987 will undoubtedly be an historic year for the African continent since for the first time more than half of the countries of the region have commissioned themselves to a liberalization process of their economic systems. Unfortunately  those reforms are taking place under unfavourable national conditions marked by structural handicaps and an inhospitable international environment.As I stated last year  and must reaffirm today  in spite of a few praiseworthy initiatives undertaken by some donor countries on a bilateral basis and by some institutions of the United Nations system at the multilateral level  on the whole  the response of the international community is not always commensurate with its common responsibility  or consistent with the tragedy of a continent crippled by its debt and cruelly affected by its recovery efforts.However  I hope  that halfway through the evaluation of the Programme of Action for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa the negative predictions will be contradicted by facts and the next session of the General Assembly will not be for our continent a meeting of betrayed hope. In our sub-region of the Maghreb  Morocco has never stopped working for a brighter future full of promise. At this juncture of emerging political and economic groups  it is inconceivable to imagine the future of the Maghreb countries without unity. The future of the peoples of the region  the fulfilment of their aspirations for progress and stability  will only be reached within the framework of Maghreb solidarity and unity. Since the dawn of our independence  the setting up of a unified Maghreb has been and remains a constant goal of our foreign policy because Morocco  which is an inseparable part of the region  entrusts its future to the global destiny of the Arab Maghreb.Aware of this requirement  the Governments of the Maghreb countries began to follow that path shortly after attaining their independence by setting up common institutions of co-operation in various areas of the economic and social sectors. The first decade of the functioning of these Maghreb institutions was promising in this regard and to a large extent responded to the will and wishes of the peoples of the region  forged out of an age-old common history and a community of religion  culture  civilization  traditions and language. The first accomplishments of this institutional Maghreb co-operation led to an increase in the exchange flows and the launching of unified programmes that benefited all countries of the region  while allowing for the possibility in future of initiating common negotiations with other groups made of industrialized countries on the other side of the Mediterranean.In our view  the Maghreb countries should give absolute priority to solving all existing disputes so as to open the way decisively to inevitable regional integration and in turn meet the many challenges ahead and face up to the technological and economic competition that will intensify within the Mediterranean region in coming years. Morocco  for its part has spared no effort to bring about good understanding and harmony between the countries of the region. Thus  we have always favourably responded to all attempts at mediation and conciliation made by leaders of friendly and brother countries aimed at restoring the climate of calm and understanding inherent in the relations among the countries of the region.We should like to take this opportunity to pay the highest tribute to the Guardian of the Holy Sanctuaries  His Majesty King Fahd of Saudi Arabia  who played an important role in bringing together two sister countries  Morocco and Algeria  and whose efforts culminated in the meeting he attended between His Majesty King Hassan II and President Chadli Benjedid last May on the Algerian-Moroccan border. That meeting resulted in a renewed dialogue between our two countries which  we hope  will further contribute to improving permanently the state of our relations  dispelling all misapprehensions and settling all outstanding disputes.Within the framework of its constant readiness to work towards the elimination of all hotbeds of tension in our sub-region  the Kingdom of Morocco last year expressed its support here for the good offices initiative undertaken by the Secretary-General of our Organization to reach a just and equitable solution of the so-called question of Western Sahara through a referendum on self-determination. That initiative has just taken a decisive step forward  since the Secretary-General decided on 24 September that a United Nations technical mission will visit the territory in the coming weeks. Mr. Perez de Cuellar has entrusted this mission with the task of gathering the necessary technical information and data available on the spot to enable him to formulate proposals designed to facilitate the holding of a referendum in Western Sahara.It is a fact that the Kingdom of Morocco favourably and promptly responded to the Secretary-General's wishes when  a few months ago  he made known his intentions to dispatch United Nations experts to the territory  so that he would be fully informed  on an impartial basis  of the actual situation on the spot. My country will do its utmost to facilitate the task of the technical mission and give it all means to exercise its prerogatives fully. According to common practice  this technical mission should be able to operate freely and without hindrance. It is up to the Assembly to give full and unfettered support to the Secretary-General and to his work in order to ensure the future success of the good office initiative and thereby promote a final settlement of this issue. In so doing  we will  at the same time  have strengthened the credibility of our Organization and helped restore a climate of harmony and peace in the Maghreb region.True  the state of the world does not inspire optimism. It is none the less also true that the solutions to the many challenges we have to face at the end of this century cannot be found in defeatism and discouragement. Through concerted action and the affirmation of our solidarity  many problems may be solved and many difficulties overcome.Dialogue  joint action and solidarity should be made the primary virtues of our Organization. It is only through such endeavour that the roots of the tree of life will continue to nourish the progress of humanity. This is the lesson in wisdom  learned from the more than 40 years existence of the United Nations. Experience teaches us that we must keep it in mind if we wish to keep alive the flame of hope."
"89",4438,"MDG",42,1987,"﻿Sir  you represent a country with which mine entertains the best of relations  and your election to the presidency of this session is a tribute to the contribution of the German Democratic Republic to the promotion of peace  social progress and international co-operation. It is also a recognition of your qualities as a statesman with which ray Government associates itself with particular pleasure since in your many activities in the United Nations you have demonstrated special understanding for the problems of the third world  particularly those that affect Africa.To your predecessor  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Bangladesh  I offer  on behalf of my delegation  sincere gratitude for his effective and responsible manner in which he fulfilled the mandate that has been entrusted to him.I cannot let this opportunity pass without congratulating the Secretary-General of the Organization on his timely and courageous initiatives at the administrative  political and economic level  in particular those for the benefit of Africa  thus meeting the challenges to multilateralism. He has our support and we wish him every success in his endeavours towards peace  his mediation efforts and the use of his good offices.The last time we were able to welcome the adoption of a real disarmament measure was on 16 December 1971  on the occasion of the adoption of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction. Since then  despite acceptance of the need for general and complete disarmament  and m particular nuclear disarmament  negotiations and discussions have centred on the concepts of limitation  reduction  control and verification. The objective demanded by the non-aligned countries of a world without nuclear weapons  has thus become increasingly illusory ' perhaps to the satisfaction of those whose strategies are still based on the precarious balance of deterrence  parity or  worse  superiority. The escalation of the arms race  the emergence of technologies at the service of theories and concepts that justify the deployment  possession and use of nuclear weapons  the promotion of a nuclear strategy based in space and the continuation of testing will continue seriously to affect international security  even if they temporarily enhance the sense of security of some states. Nevertheless  the problem is not insoluble. The non-aligned countries have on several occasions proposed collateral deterrent measures such as the conclusion of an international treaty on the prohibition of the use  or threat of the use  of nuclear weapons and the creation of nuclear-free zones or zones of peace  while the two super-Powers and the two politico-military blocs have been engaging in countless initiatives in Geneva  in Vienna and elsewhere; without giving an exhaustive list  I shall mention the treaties on strategic arms limitation  the limitation of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes and the most recent proposals on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe  the freezing and reduction of military expenditures  and conventional as well as nuclear disarmament in central Europe.We thus have a consensus which must be structured and harmonized if it is to be democratic and effective. To this end  we have available to us the Conference on Disarmament and the Disarmament Commission as well as the relevant departments of the Secretariat. We shall soon hold our third special session devoted to disarmament  the agenda for which includes the evaluation of new facts and trends  and the consideration of the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. These few indications convince us that the United Nations must be properly informed of the state of affairs and progress of negotiations on disarmament.In any event we should be churlish were we not to hail  as is appropriate  the announcement made on 18 September last by the Soviet Union and the United States relating to their acceptance of the principle and the broad lines of a treaty on the elimination of medium- and short-range nuclear missiles. From 1972  the date of the first strategic arms limitation talks  to 1987  has been a long and difficult road. Imagination  a sense of compromise and a desire for dialogue were needed to reach this result  and we shall not attempt analysis  for in truth what matters is the spirit that allowed the adoption of this very promising decision. We support the joint declaration of the six nations which  on 22 May 1987  in anticipation of the event  stated  inter alia  that it had been proved that when the political will existed it was possible to arrive at major agreements on nuclear disarmament measures.Unfortunately  such political will failed to materialize last month  when we completed our discussions on the relationship between disarmament and development. There were many points of agreement  but the doctrinaire perception of reality caught up with us at the crossroads. Indeed  if the world needs disarmament as much as it needs development  if they are the conditions for a system of international global and collective security  and if we admit the negative repercussions of the level and scope of military expenditures on the economic world situation  where is the harm in proposing the creation of a fund for economic and social development  financed through resources released as a result of disarmament measures or the limitation of armaments?Some might tell us that the time is not ripe  although the question has been under discussion  on and off  for more than a quarter of a century. We may also be told that security has priority over all other considerations. If so  we shall respond that our security requires development and that to be convinced of this  it suffices it to look at the kind of development that has been bequeathed to us.Though they use the usual language  there is agreement among international authorities and international experts - be they from the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank or the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) - that  apart from a few pockets of relative prosperity  the economy of the third world is on the verge of bankruptcy. The relevant statistics and figures are so grim that they are difficult to believe. First  for 70 per cent of low-income countries  basic commodities represent 50 per cent of total export earnings.Secondly  for half of such countries  the same commodities bring in 9Ü to 10 0 per cent of export earnings  out of which 8 0 per cent is devoted to the import of foodstuffs and fuels.Thirdly  the average deficit in the commodities sector in the period 1980-1984  for all developing countries  has been assessed at $14.9 billion per year  half of which is the burden of low-income countries.Fourthly  those countries have only received approximately 30 per cent of compensatory financial assistance  be it Stabex or Coiapex of the European Economic Community (EEC) or the mechanism of compensatory financing of the International Monetary Fund.Fifthly  in 1986  the prices of industrial goods rose by 17 per cent. The export earnings of commodities dropped by an average of 26 per cent and the losses suffered by developing countries because of deterioration of terms of trade rose to $100 billion.Sixthly  in 1986 an average of 37 per cent of export earnings were devoted to the repayment of debt  which is 50 per cent above the 25 per cent limit considered tolerable.Finally  loans from commercial banks have declined by two thirds since 198Q. Commercial credits only represent one sixth of the 1981 level. The level of direct foreign investments has plummeted by approximately 50 per cent  and official development assistance has been reduced to half the 1982 level.I need not continue  bet us simply say that we have reached the breaking-point  while international institutions are beginning to run out of steam and private banks  on which we have relied for the recovery of investments and free enterprise  are becoming more than reluctant in granting us new loans. Thus we are now bearing the overwhelming social burden of policies referred to as curative. The problems of commodities  trade and development  and indebtedness are intimately related. The reaction of some - inherited from the nineteenth century - has been to say that Oliver Twist is still asking for more. But if we wish to give real meaning to interdependence and international economic security at the dawning of the twenty-first century  let us really meet the challenge inherent in the relationship between disarmament and development. Let us think in positive terms about a common fund for commodities  and let us accept the need to establish an additional mechanism for compensatory financing while improving existing mechanisms. Let us reverse the negative trends of the transfer o± resources from developing countries and  above all  let us admit that it is important to embark upon a genuine dialogue on the problem of indebtedness. The proposal to create a stabilization fund for commodities  a monetary fund and a development fund among third world countries  which was confirmed by the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar during the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization  seems  in view of these considerations  to be most timely.It is true that in adopting resolution 41/202 and by the consensus that we supported during UNCTAD VII we have placed this dialogue in a general framework. But the dialogue must become political in nature  for above and beyond technical  financial and banking considerations it is the future and security of all our peoples for many decades to come which is at stake. That dialogue must also be open and not take place behind the screen of preconceived or rigid ideas. In other words  on the basis of the idea of shared responsibility  we must ensure that this dialogue is at no time overtaken by events. It is in that spirit that I should like briefly to recall the position of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar on the question of the debt.Our shared responsibility with regard to the rising tide of debt imposes an obligation to undertake direct concerted action between debtors  grouped together in a club of debtors  so to speak  on the one hand and their creditors on the other. If the restructuring of the debt is to be viable it requires an amendment of the rules of the Paris Club and the London Club  a one-year moratorium on interest modelled on the practices of the International Development Association and the fixing of the percentage of the export earnings to be devoted to debt servicing on the basis of the figures for several years.In this connection we have proposed the following alternatives; either to request or decide upon the freezing of debt repayment for the next 10 years or to limit the payment to a maximum of 10 per cent of the value of the export earnings of each country. The basic objective is to postpone payment of most of the debts to the year 2000.The strategy must contain elements that allow us to bring about the recovery and strengthening of our national economies. That objective would involve reconsideration of the concept of adjustment programmes  which must be based on growth and must not exist simply for the repayment of the debt. In this connection it would be appropriate to have a more equitable distribution of the burden of adjustment and to proceed to an easing of the rules of conditionality required by international monetary and financial institutions and acceleration of the procedures for subscription to structural adjustment loans. Such measures must be coupled with structural reform of the international financial system.We are pleased that elements of our position have already been reflected in some reference documents. It is not our intention to make these elements pre-conditions  for in the final analysis we must play the game of solidarity with both the developing and the developed countries if we want to avoid the blocking of the dialogue  to the detriment of the interests of all.I have just dealt  in a somewhat linear fashion  with some of the problems inherent in disarmament  development and debt  in the firm belief that we must find solutions to these problems that will contribute to the strengthening of international security. Nevertheless  our efforts would be in vain if we did not use our imagination and work together to ease or eliminate the regional tensions and conflicts that continue to beset the third world  including Africa  the Neat East and Middle East  central Africa and South-East Asia.Indeed  in South Africa the hopes born of the mass rebellion which occurred last year have been swept away by the maintenance of the state of emergency over the entire territory. Despite unanimous condemnation by the international community  the Pretoria regime continues to persist in its defiance by tightening the apartheid system. Under the pretext of better mastering apartheid by controlling it  it continues to ignore the needs of the black population. That same regime lends support to the illegal occupation of Namibia and increases its murderous acts of aggression against front-line States.How much longer will we continue to accept this savage policy of domination  this hegemonism? How much longer will we continue to accept this policy which subordinates a man's dignity to the colour of his skin? Are we to be satisfied with mere talk of condemnation in the face of the humiliation of man  the image of God on earth?It is those considerations that lead the delegation of Madagascar to congratulate and strongly support the Nordic countries  which have decided to impose economic sanctions against South  Africa  and to encourage all those that still hesitate to follow suit. We do not have sufficient power to act in these matters  much less the necessary resources to assist the front-line States  but we have the voice of reason and wisdom and we shall continue to raise it for as long as the South African regime exists.In Palestine  what crime has been committed by the Palestinian people that it should be hunted as one hunts a deer in the forest? Is it the crime of claiming its legitimate rights or of recovering its lands  its homeland? what is the reason for the persistent rejection of peace  security and stability in the Middle East? Why is it that all the parties to the conflict in the Middle East persist in maintaining the explosive situation in the region  with all the dangers inherent in it? Can one sacrifice the life of an entire people to protect the conflicting interests of all sides? Can one condemn a people to wander  like a ghost  for its entire life? We shall not cease to appeal to the international community to recognize the right of that people to self-determination and to a homeland freely chosen within the context of a peaceful overall settlement of the Middle East crisis. Such a settlement could be found through the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties directly concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  and the permanent members of the Security Council.We cannot remain silent in the face of the equally crucial problem of the Lebanese people. The soil of Lebanon continues to be occupied by foreign forces. It seems that 12 years of conflict have only sharpened the will of the enemies of Lebanon to see the country torn apart  divided and subjected to contradictory spheres of influence. Therefore  with the Lebanese people wounded  torn apart and the victim of the conflicts in the Middle East  but refusing to die and determined to defend its life and its reasons for living  we demand the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanese soil in accordance with United Nations resolutions  so that the Lebanese people may regain its full authority over all its national territory. With regard to Afghanistan  can we simply sit on our hands in the face of the efforts for national reconciliation? The Afghan people have suffered for many years. Some have confined themselves to purely and simply condemning the presence of foreign troops in that country. We will say mote; some are encouraging and continuing to support those who are against the regime. But why? Is it in order for one ideology to win out over another? Can we treat so lightly the identity and personality of a people? That is why  after considerable thought  we support the policy of national reconciliation in Afghanistan and condemn any attempt at blocking it.The same goes for the reunification of Korea  which we most vigorously support politically and diplomatically. There may be a confrontation of ideologies  but people can engage in dialogue and reach understanding.As for Western Sahara  we repeat our support for resolution 104 (XIX) of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and take note of the Secretary-General's decision to send a fact-finding mission to the Sahara. However  that mission might be a futile exercise in the absence of a prior political commitment for the establishment of an interim United Nations administration in the Territory.With regard to the Chad-Libya conflict  we respectfully abide by the decision of our Heads of State or (Government at the last summit of the OAU  namely  confirmation of the Ad Hoc Committee's mandate to organise negotiations between the two belligerent parties to find a just and lasting solution to the problem  and the search for a negotiated political settlement to their border dispute.In Central America we see a glimmer of hope  thanks to the commendable efforts of the countries of the region to ease tension and re-establish stability in that part of the world. Thus we unreservedly support the Guatemala Agreement of 7 August 1987. With reference to the Iran-Iraq war  we cannot fail once again to deplore the fact that Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  demanding a cease-fire  has not been implemented. Of course  one might fear that effective implementation of a cease-fire could be undermined by those who supply weapons  as that might run counter to what they regard to be their vital interests. Also  one wonders whether negotiations between those two fraternal countries - now enemies - could ever take place while they are obstinately clinging to their respective positions.This war makes no sense and has lasted far too long. It represents an ongoing threat to countries of the region in particular  and in light of the present state of affairs could become internationalised. Furthermore  the concentration of naval forces in the region is a real danger for the whole world  and it is truly regrettable that security for international shipping has been affected and become practically non-existent as a result of this conflict.Madagascar  through its President  has consistently called for the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a demilitarised and denuclearised zone of peace. But can we today still hope for such a development? Hence we wish to address an appeal to all parties in the Iran-Iraq war to remain calm and avoid inflaming further this most dangerous and critical situation in the Gulf. In particular  we appeal to Iran and Iraq to accept implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) on a cease-fire.It has never been Madagascar' s posture to remain on the sidelines of international affairs; thus we advocate an immediate cease-fire simultaneously with a halt on all arms deliveries to the belligerents  and the establishment of a fact-finding commission to determine responsibility for the start of the war. Finally  we support the establishment of an international force to ensure the security  safety and freedom of navigation in the Gulf.  We cannot conclude this analysis of regional conflicts without emphasizing in the Assembly that these regional conflicts might have been solved but for the persistent policy of interference in the internal affairs of third-world countries.We have come here to seek peace  justice  social progress and co-operation - ideals and objectives which we shall attain by displaying the utmost responsibility and the needed generosity. A reading of the Charter always leads us to conclude that it is in keeping with the common good. Even though peace remains  as it should  our primary concern  in these 40 years priorities and realities have often changed.Our Organization's role is also to allow for the necessary adjustments with due regard to our purposes and principles. And when initiatives sometimes reflect ideals set forth in the Charter it is not intended to counter or bypass them  but simply to clarify their scope by bearing in mind the evolution of international relations on the ideological  political  economic and social levels.Thus  our support for the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security stems from two considerations; to give the United Nations another chance to play its legitimate role  after the failure of our commitment to a system of collective security; and to recognize that the time has come to renew and ennoble our debate on the basis of tolerance  mutual respect  dialogue and interdependence.It has never been a crime to proclaim one's dedication to peace and to advocate a security system for all individuals  peoples and nations. At the end of our quest and efforts  may peace  justice  social progress and co-operation reign į and no longer be empty words. May our Organization be the master builder. May the ; peoples of the whole world be the beneficiaries. "
"90",4476,"MDV",42,1987,"﻿Sir  it is indeed a pleasure for me and the members of my delegation to extend to you our sincere congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your election to this high office is a tribute to your personal qualities and record of distinction in your career as well as a recognition of your experience. It is also a well-deserved tribute to your country  with which Maldives has most cordial relations. I am fully confident that under your wise and able stewardship the Assembly will make positive and substantive progress and reach successful conclusions. My delegation joins previous speakers who have expressed appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasneed Choudhury  for the able and exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. As a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation  we were particularly proud and honoured to be associated with him and with his successes in our deliberations during the last year.We are meeting at a time when important changes are taking place in the world and historic trends are taking shape. Some of these changes are to be welcomed  as unprecedented opportunities emerge from them for the advancement of peace  justice and security  while others pose new problems and challenges confronting the international community. While recalling the momentous and timely decisions taken by this Assembly to revitalize the functioning of the United Nations and to strengthen its role and its capacity in facing the enormous challenges confronting the international community  we are happy to note that the significant developments that have taken place in several areas of international relations have resulted in renewed confidence in the vital and irreplaceable role of the United Nations and recognition of the values upheld by this body. It is with satisfaction that we note the distinct improvement in the international climate and in particular in relations between the East and the West.Like a number of previous speakers  we warmly welcome the agreement in principle reached last month between the United States and the Soviet Union on the complete elimination of intermediate- and shorter-range nuclear forces and we hope that this accord will lead to further agreements on the larger issues of global concern  such as strategic and space armaments. We also hope that this significant agreement will enhance the new atmosphere with respect to the multilateral disarmament negotiations aimed at genuine arms limitation and complete disarmament. In this context  we should like to see the Conference on Disarmament  in Geneva  progress rapidly in its deliberations on a chemical weapons convention and continue dealing with the vital issues on its agenda  such as a comprehensive test ban and the prevention of an arras race in outer space.We should also like to acknowledge the link between disarmament and development as highlighted by the recently concluded Conference on Disarmament and Development.Maldives resolutely continues to support all efforts being made towards the objective of disarmament and demilitarisation. It is also our belief that  while the bilateral agreements between the super-Powers and multilateral negotiations to provide the necessary catalyst towards general disarmament  ample opportunities exist for regional and sub regional arrangements which would eventually contribute towards the ultimate objectives of disarmament. It is for this reason that Maldives has supported the proposals for establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace in various parts of the world. We have  obviously  given particular importance to the United Nations Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace and the proposal for establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia  where Maldives is located.While highlighting the significant events that have taken place during the past year  I should also like to recall the conclusions of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII)  convened in Geneva this summer  and to note with satisfaction the positive trends embodied in the final act of the Conference  which we genuinely hope will lead to a resurgence of momentum in North-South dialogue and signal a reversal of the current sceptical and adverse situation regarding international co-operation for development. While we are encouraged by the positive developments in the overall international climate  we remain deeply concerned at the mounting dangers and problems which threaten international peace and security  some of which are well within the issues discussed and debated again and again in this Assembly for many years.There is no doubt that the most urgent concern of the international community at the present time is the conflict between Iran and Iraq  two independent countries  Members of the United Nations  have been engaged in a senseless war for seven long years  during which hundreds of thousands of people  including civilians  have lost their lives and enormous material destruction has been inflicted. The international community has now recognized the dangerous implications of this conflict for world peace and security. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) reflects the grave concern of the world community over the issue and the need for intensified efforts in halting that bloody conflict. As before  Maldives renews its call to the combatant nations to stop the fighting and resolve their dispute by peaceful means. It is our belief that the United Nations has an important role to play in the achievement of a peaceful and just solution to this conflict.The aspirations of the Palestinian people to their inalienable national rights remain unfulfilled. Israel retains its unyielding hold on Arab and Palestinian lands  including Al-Quds  and continues relentlessly to go ahead with its policy of establishing illegal settlements in Arab lands. We have long acknowledged that the question of Palestine is the very core of the Middle East problem and that its just settlement is the only way to peace in the Middle East. We have called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied Palestinian and Arab lands. We firmly believe that there cannot be a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question and the aggravated crisis in the Middle East unless the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination is recognized and fulfilled. Maldives strongly supports the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East  with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in order to find а comprehensive solution to the problem.Maldives has always condemned the odious policy of racial discrimination and resolutely supported measures towards its elimination. In particular  we resolutely condemn the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid practised by the regime in South Africa and consider it a crime against humanity. We view the latest developments in South Africa with the utmost gravity and concern. The crisis situation  as it continues to unfold  demonstrates the fact that South Africa's black majority is under virtual siege. The racist regime has shown itself to possess neither the policy nor the capacity for progressive change. We believe that apartheid cannot be reformed or improved upon by trifling incremental measures. It must be dismantled in its entirety. We are disappointed that agreement has not been reached on applying comprehensive and effective sanctions against the arrogant regime in Pretoria. However  we welcome the decision made by some multilateral corporations to stop their operations in South Africa.The racist regime in Pretoria continues to occupy Namibia in defiance of international law and world-wide condemnation. It is plundering the immense natural resources of Namibia  to the benefit of the privileged white minority  and  to our deep regret  it is doing so with the help and complicity of some other States Members of the Organization. We believe that the only basis for a peaceful settlement in Namibia is Security Council resolution 435 (1978)   and we reject any attempts to link the question of Namibia's freedom to extraneous issues.The situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea have remained tense  without any significant developments towards a settlement. We reiterate our conviction that only through a comprehensive political solution on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops can the sovereignty and territorial integrity of those countries be restored  allowing their peoples to determine their own affairs for themselves. We pledge our full support for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General in these complex issues.Another conflict that needs our attention is the one in Cyprus. This prolonged conflict should be solved urgently  with due regard to the national integrity of Cyprus and the aspirations of its people. We appreciate the tireless and sincere efforts of the Secretary-General in seeking the settlement of that conflict.The world economy still continues to be caught in serious imbalances and dislocations  while the majority of developing countries are faced with serious difficulties in adjusting to structural changes imposed upon them by such reversal factors as the debt burden  exorbitantly high real interest rates  the fall in commodity prices and the arrogance of protectionism. On the other hand  the significant decrease in the growth rate in the industrial world has caused much disparity in an already aggravated situation. Debate as been going on for many years about the world economic order. A dialogue was initiated between the North and South without any concrete results. My delegation hopes  as I mentioned at the beginning of my statement  that with a new positive trend emerging in the international climate steps will be taken towards the implementation of measures capable of meeting the needs of global economic reform.In a world which is teeming with tensions  conflicts and wars and in which mankind is still hostage to awful nuclear arsenals of its own creation  the importance and indispensability of the United Nations cannot be overemphasized. Although our Organization has its problems and difficulties  we feel that there is no better institutional arrangement than the United Nations to deal with problems and grievances among States and of peoples. Our firm belief in the constructive role which the United Nations is playing will not be diminished by its shortcomings  which are often caused by the deliberate and self-centred acts of a few. We will continue to have full confidence and trust in the United Nations and will support it as best we can."
"91",4523,"MEX",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President on behalf of the Government of Mexico  I should like to congratulate you on your well-deserved election. I should like also to assure you of my delegation's willingness to contribute to the success of your presidency. Your competence and experience are a guarantee that we shall achieve our aim.Allow me also to reiterate Mexico's support to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. The initiative that he undertook last November  together with the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS)   regarding the Central American conflict  as well as his recent mediation between Iran and Iraq  are proof of his unswerving commitment to the cause of peace.This illustrious Peruvian diplomat has been entrusted with conducting the work of the United Nations at a particularly difficult time  when doubts are being expressed concerning the effectiveness of multilateralism and even the very validity of the precepts upon which the world Organization is based. In his arduous tasks he has the backing of Latin America and the developing countries. This solidarity is part of a larger contribution the aim of which is to establish an international system based on genuine co-operation among all States.A year ago from this rostrum  President Miguel de la Madrid emphatically stated Mexico's unswerving commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. That declaration faithfully reflects the strength of our foreign policy commitment in subscribing to the norms that lay the foundations for peaceful coexistence of all peoples based on respect and solidarity. They constitute the backbone of Mexico's international conduct. For Mexico  compliance with law and respect for the essential rules of international coexistence are basic elements of its foreign policy. It is not a matter of merely postulating universal values in the abstract  but of sustaining principles that are necessary for the preservation of national sovereignty - that is  rules of behaviour that have acquired a special meaning for us within our social system and history and are at the core of our nation's values.Ethics and law as applied to political action necessarily lead to a search for just agreements in international relations that eliminate confrontations among States; to the establishment of dialogue in which there is real communication  to the achievement  through active and flexible diplomacy  of the conciliation of opposing interests  and to the curbing of the arrogance of the powerful - in a word  to the promotion of international co-operation as the basis for a peaceful coexistence based on justice and equality. Mexico repudiates all forms of intervention wherever they occur. By defending this principle we protect our own interests and thus ensure against interference in our nation's affairs. By upholding the self-determination of peoples we avoid the temptation of limiting our own sovereignty or imposing upon ourselves political models alien to us. We insist also on the peaceful solution of disputes to ensure that the community of States submits to legal order and abandons the tendency towards the use of force  power and arbitrariness in international relations.These tenets  the application of which we have demanded without distinction  are not ours alone but a fundamental part of modern international law. Their enforcement protects the legitimate interests of the community of States in general. Hence my country's unswerving support for the work of the United Nations  which embodies the shared ideal of strict observance of the legal order.The consistency of Mexico's foreign policy with these unchanging principles explains the policy of the Mexican Government  and the other member countries of the Contadora and Support Groups with regard to the Central American conflict. It should be recalled that in January 1983 there was a climate of confrontation and distrust in the isthmus  where mounting political tensions and the militarization of the region were the harbinger of an imminent conflagration.The Contadora Group emerged as an example of mediation in good faith with the will to co-operate with the Central American Governments so that seemingly insurmountable antagonisms could be channelled through negotiations. We have worked towards dialogue and reconciliation among the parties to restore a climate of political trust and thus overcome the danger of armed confrontation and intervention  seeking a fair balance with regard to the political interests of the States of the area. The activities of the Contadora Group do not respond only to a generic imperative or the memory of foreign interference and internal and international armed conflicts that have distorted the organic development of the Central American nations. We are trying  by promoting the diplomatic settlement of disputes  slowing the arms build-up and negotiating the economic and social development of the region  to avoid the extension of confrontation and guarantee the legitimate national interests of each of the Contadora countries  while protecting the political stability of Latin America.The violation of the legal order in the isthmus undermines the possibility of claiming one's rights. The arms race and the state of war force the conflicting parties to allocate ridiculous amounts of investments to defence. The displacement of refugees also contribute to the creation of social tension. Recent history shows  too  that regional conflicts  limited at the start  can spread beyond the original area to neighbouring regions. It is essential that our nations prevent war and find a just  comprehensive solution to Central American problems. This is a task that cannot be postponed.In Central America there are two opposing interpretations of the world  different political ideas and contradictory feelings about Latin American history and the means of contributing to the settlement of international conflicts.The first adheres to a system of areas of influence that even in contemporary strategic terms seems obsolete and that would make force the main motivation for the conduct of States. This approach promotes war as an instrument for hegemonic affirmation and denies the pluralism of our peoples for the benefit of a supposed national security. At the same time  it deepens contradictions within the s  societies  which it claims have political freedom  preventing them from developing their own institutions and denying them the opportunity to make their own decisions. The second sees politics as a privileged means of making history. It discusses antagonisms at the negotiating table and tries to resolve them through diplomacy. It believes that the peaceful solution of the Central American controversy is in both the short and the long term in the abiding interests of all the countries of the region. This interpretation upholds the basic tenets of Western moral and intellectual traditions - that is  a social and international order which is based on reason  that identifies human progress with intelligence and creativity and that stems from the indissoluble link between political practice and ethical principles - and affirms the concept of man as a potential for irreversible freedom.For more than four years now we have persevered in an effort to guide the Central American conflict in accordance with this political logic. We are gratified that those actions contributed to the peace agreement signed in Guatemala last August by the Presidents of the Central American countries.Those agreements mark a new stage in the life of the region and reflect the fundamental commitments of those of us Who have struggled to carry out our task of mediation: national reconciliation through dialogue and political action; pluralistic democracy that guarantees human rights and promotes social justice; free exercise of the right of self-determination; the cessation of support for irregular forces and the corresponding obligation to refrain from the use of one's own territory for the illegal activities of those groups; and a decision to continue negotiations on security and arms limitation - in short  to foster international co-operation in meeting the most urgent economic needs of the societies of the region.I reiterate the Mexican Government's satisfaction at the signing of the Guatemala agreement and its readiness to participate  together with the Contadora and Support Groups and the Secretaries-General of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations  in the International Verification and follow-up Commission to give effect to the obligations assumed by the Central American Governments. I reiterate also our determination to contribute  in association with the member States of the international community  to the fulfilment of a reconstruction project to increase substantially economic co-operation between the five countries of the area.Undoubtedly the Governments of Central America have shouldered their responsibility. We now need the international community's respect and assistance. Other States  especially those with interests and ties in the region  now have an obligation to co-operate with specific action in ensuring the realization of the aspirations to reconciliation of the Central American countries.Latin America is today confronting the most serious economic crisis in its contemporary history. An adverse international atmosphere combined with age-old deficiencies in the region's production infrastructure has created stagnation with inflation and a decline in the standard of living of its communities and has reduced the possibilities of progress and development in the region. It cannot be denied that in great measure the crisis has its origins in outside factors beyond the control of our Governments. A series of international circumstances combined to transform us into net capital exporters. Interest rates at unprecedented high levels  continued lowering of commodity prices and growing protectionism in the industrialized countries.The countries of Latin America have made an enormous internal effort to adjust our economies and face the debt-servicing problem. Even so  the region as a whole has not been able to achieve its necessary development objectives.We have noted with concern the direction that the industrialized countries wish to give to the plans to resolve the crisis. The proposed programme does not contribute to the design of an international co-operation system based on the principles of the United Nations Charter  nor does it help distribute the developing countries' burden of adjustment or reactivate in a symmetrical and balanced manner the functioning of the international economy as a whole.In fact  when the allocation of financial flows is tied to programmes of commercial liberalization  for the purpose of providing resources in debt restructuring negotiations and obtaining new capital  the international financial organisms discredit the very foundations of the multilateral trade system non-discrimination and most-favoured-nation treatment. Thus the developing countries' possibilities of promoting greater access by their exports to the international market based on centralized negotiations in a preferential system that compensates for disadvantages  are diminished.If to this is added the growing recourse by industrialized countries to the imposition of new conditions for access to their markets  demanding the opening up of the service and high technology sectors  direct investment and a stricter interpretation of the norms that govern intellectual property  the conclusion must be that the developing countries are seeing the advent of a new plan for an international economy that does not necessarily meet their interests.Latin America has chosen to face these challenges by strengthening and widening its consultation  co-operation and co-ordination mechanisms to achieve greater participation in the negotiation and operation of the international economic system. Through regional economic organisms and special mechanisms such as the Cartagena Consensus and the Group of Eight  we intend to strengthen the structure of an international economic order that will contribute to establishing a more solid basis for the collective self-sufficiency of the developing countries.The regional action does not adversely affect the search for new understandings among the developing countries designed to strengthen their collective action with regard to world economy. The new directions that are proposed in the fields of currency  finance and trade necessitate attempts to reach a new consensus and new negotiating strategies so as to regain the initiative in the process of changing the international economic system.The magnitude of the challenge demands United  logical action by all the developing countries  focusing on international co-operation that will protect their legitimate interests and prompt the industrialized countries to enter into dialogue and negotiation on all matters on the international economic agenda.The question of development problems necessarily leads to that of disarmament. Only a few weeks ago we examined in this forum the undeniable link between these problems and the arms race  with the consequent diversion of funds and attention in the political and economic spheres  to the detriment of a more just distribution of wealth. We referred to the expenditure on the accumulation of arsenals and the resultant distortions in the international economic system. The existence of nuclear weapons constitutes a threat to life on this planet and  while it is true that the responsibility for eliminating the danger of a holocaust falls chiefly on the nuclear Powers  the cause of peace and disarmament is that of all States.This is the purpose of the initiative of the Group of Six: the Heads of Government of Mexico  Argentina  India  Greece  Sweden and Tanzania have reclaimed our right to life. Their call to the super-Powers stresses two crucial themes: avoidance of the militarization of space and the prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. Both measures would represent a decisive political advance towards the achievement of broader agreements. I reaffirm in this forum my country's readiness to collaborate towards the eventual establishment of a verification system for a moratorium on nuclear tests.Three years ago when the Group of Six began its negotiations the disarmament talks between the super-Powers had been suspended. Today  fortunately  they have not only been resumed but offer promising prospects. My Government trusts that the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union will soon culminate in a treaty that eliminates short— and medium-range missiles from the planet.We are pleased to see the beginning of an understanding not only to halt the development of new weapons but to eliminate an existing category of weapons. This must be only a first step towards the reduction and eventual eradication of strategic weapons.We insist that nuclear disarmament is a priority  but we cannot neglect the problem of conventional armaments  the development of which complicates the stability of  the various regional conflicts  in which the super-Powers are involved and which must be resolved through dialogue and negotiation. We demand for Kampuchea and Afghanistan the same respect for the principle of non-intervention that we claim for Central America. We demand the independence of the people of Namibia and the elimination of the odious system of apartheid. On the South Atlantic  we again call for a political agreement that will protect the inalienable rights of Argentina. We emphasize that a definitive comprehensive solution to the Middle East controversies can be achieved only on the basis of respect for and compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.We wish to express our special concern over the situation in the Persian Gulf. We trust that the principles of the United Nations Charter will prevail. We call on the Governments of Iran and Iraq to resolve their differences in accordance with the recent mandate of the Security Council. The mission of good offices undertaken by the Secretary-General must be recognized and supported in order that a dignified and just agreement may be achieved.Mexico will continue to strive for the strengthening of the United Nations system and the preservation of the basic tenets of multilateral actions dialogue and the balance of interests. To that end we shall spare no effort to strengthen the institutional forums of the community of nations. We shall also continue to participate in the informal groupings of collective diplomacy whose final aim is to strengthen those tenets. Hence we shall maintain our active and responsible commitment to the political efforts of the Contadora support groups  the Cartegena Consensus and the Group of Six. Similarly  we have formed  together with Argentina  Brazil  Colombia  Panama  Peru  Uruguay and Venezuela  a group of eight Latin American democracies to establish a permanent mechanism for consultations and concerted political action. We are making every effort to guarantee autonomy  respect and dignity for our countries and to ensure for coming generations a future of peace  freedom  democracy  economic well-being and social progress.Next November the Heads of State of those eight countries will meet in Mexico. Their discussions could contribute to the definition of new modalities with regard to the role of our region in world affairs. We are convinced that at that meeting new proposals will emerge in order to make of Latin America a more United region that is more at one with the interests o£ the developing world and more willing to fight for the basic principles of the international legal order.From its inception the United Nations has promoted understanding and co-operation among States and their commitment to the principles and purposes that emerged from a long  civilizing undertaking begun at the end of the cruel experience of two world wars. Its aim is basically to further multilateral co-operation in order to promote the shared progress of nations  to enhance the dignity of the human person  to promote respect for fundamental rights and  above all  to ensure permanent peace that banishes the scourge of war and its attendant suffering and devastation.The drafters of the Charter were never naive enough to believe that the community of States could be built on some abstract Utopia  indifferent to the asymmetrical distribution of power. The structure given to the Security Council reveals the extent to which political realism and the need to provide the United Nations with the instruments for effective action defined the shape of the Organization - hence the powers vested in certain States regarding matters of exceptional importance  especially those concerning peace and security. It must be underlined  however  that such attributes are more a responsibility than a privilege  more an obligation for moderation and balance than the possibility of adapting international relations to unilateral interests.Unfortunately  those ideals of civilized political behaviour have suffered serious setbacks. Bipolarism and efforts to consolidate spheres of influence bring about alignments that render peace and progress towards international democracy more difficult. The weakening of multilateral organizations in turn erodes the fundamental norms of international law. The arms race threatens our existence and sharpens economic imbalances. Grave regional conflicts persist and could produce wider confrontations. The development needs of the vast majority of countries represented here have not been satisfied  and they require adequate and urgent attention.We have not yet succeeded in imposing the rule of law over the use of force  dignity and respect over the abuse of power and the aspirations of independence and self-determination over hegemonic designs. Nor have we been able to replace efforts to dominate and exploit by those who have a concentration of resources with a world of international co-operation. No one should therefore be surprised at the recurring discouragement and scepticism regarding our Organization.But it is also true that without this forum to further and regulate the international order  relations among States would be dominated by a policy of unrestricted power. Without failing to recognize the aims and limitations of the United Nations  we should rid ourselves of the notion that it has failed  for it has registered considerable success in a variety of areas of international co-operation  as we have described on past occasions. That being said  it is clear that the great tasks facing the Organization make it imperative that all Member States  without exception  fully assume their responsibilities. Improvement in international life requires our concerted political will. All nations have the obligation to make concessions in secondary matters in order to agree on fundamentals  to adopt constructive approaches in order to find practical solutions beneficial to all  to be always open to dialogue while setting aside sterile confrontations and useless recriminations  to renounce all attempts at domination and unjust privileges - in short  to strengthen our genuine solidarity.In reaffirming its unwavering determination to contribute to the full attainment of these purposes - the greatest conquest of our political culture - Mexico urges Member States to persevere in the constant effort to make reason and law prevail among individuals and nations."
"92",4618,"MLI",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of Mali  I should like to join preceding speakers in congratulating you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I have pleasure in paying tribute to you as a statesman and also a distinguished representative of a country with which Mali has excellent ties of co-operation. The wealth of your long experience gives promise of real success in our deliberations here. I should like also to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  who  thanks to his competence and dedication  presided so effectively over the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.1 also pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the renewal of whose mandate to head our Organization shows the high regard in which he is held by the international community.Article 1 of the United Nations Charter sets forth the objectives of our Organization. They are  inter alia  international peace and security  international co-operation  development and respect for human rights. Although the interdependence of these purposes has often been restated  over the last 20 years particular emphasis has been placed on priority to be given to development programmes. So there has quite rightly been a movement away from the drafting of standards to the application of procedures and the establishment of bodies. Development has become an integral part of all the relevant programmes of the United Nations system.Yet  despite the United Nations capacity to manage multilateral co-operation for development  the world  in particular the developing world  has been characterized for more than a decade by a continuing deterioration in economic situations. This deterioration in the world economy has been discussed by many speakers  sometimes in a very moving way  and today it has become intolerable for the developing countries. The present world economic system embraces relations between States and the internal regimes of those States. The division of the economic system between industrialized countries and developing countries is no justification for structural imbalance or exploitation.While the developed countries have had positive growth rates  the economies of the developing countries with rare exceptions# have continued to stagnate or even deteriorate. The combined impact of the constant fall in the export prices of commodities  the constant increase in the prices of imports  the increase in and instability of world interest rates  the excessive and unforeseeable fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies and the fall in development aid have led to a deterioration in the economic situation of the developing countries  in particular the less-developed of them.While for many countries exports guaranteed their ability to repay their external debts  creditors adopted protectionist measures and other discriminatory practices having a similar impact against exports from developing countries. These factors militated against the growth of the world economy in general and the economy of the developing countries in particular- To repay foreign debts  these countries have been forced increasingly to transfer abroad resources that should be available for development. Not always having those resources available  and in order to honour deadlines  they have been forced to ask for new loans  thus getting into a vicious circle  the outcome of which is difficult to foresee and which in any event will not help them to regain solvency. However  we have to recognize that most of those countries have made tremendous efforts towards achieving structural adaptations in their economies. Continuous rescheduling  the adoption of austerity measures and basically restrictive adjustments have not been able to slow down or ease the burden of foreign debt. Notwithstanding the heavy sacrifice  the expected results have not always been attained. Unfortunately  in many instances the situation has even deteriorated.It is time for all those involved to consider the implications of the foreign debt of developing countries so as to arrive at solutions that are more just and humanely acceptable. Such an approach would involve initiating a real dialogue and effective consultations between debtors and creditors on the basis of shared responsibility and within the context of a strategy oriented towards growth and development. It is time for creditors to understand that strengthening national economies  improving collective negotiating positions and remedying the fundamental imbalances of all kinds are indispensable elements for economic and political security. It is only if those conditions are met that the advent of the just and democratic society so wholeheartedly desired by the United Nations can become a reality.Mali endorses the idea of inviting the international community to consider  as soon as possible  the series of initiatives adopted by the Organization of African Unity  the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 with a view to bringing an equitable solution to the debt crisis and to the imbalance in the international economic system. It reaffirms its commitment to the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development and the proposals to re-launch the North-South dialogue  including global negotiations  the programme on remediate measures and  lastly  the convening of a conference on currencies and finance.It is essential to re-launch the global negotiations that are currently frozen  in order to arrive at a consensus on the establishment of a new international economic order that is more just and more equitable and that will put an end to its many current distortions. Today the North-South dialogue is  for developed and developing countries alike  an unavoidable imperative. In this connection the results of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) justify many hopes  provided that the conclusions and recommendations are followed by concrete measures of implementation.The serious economic concerns have not made us forget the equally disturbing disruptions in the international political situation. Foremost among these is apartheid  that abominable practice which has accurately been declared a crime against humanity. The racists in Pretoria have already demonstrated to the international community that they are the enemies of peace  both in South Africa and throughout the region. While developments throughout the world show that it is time to recognize the legitimate aspirations of the black majority  the racist minority in Pretoria is stubbornly perpetuating the abhorrent system of apartheid.In Namibia  as in South Africa  every day people are arrested  tortured and killed for the sole crime of having peacefully demonstrated against pass laws  forced displacement to bantustans and arbitrary arrests.Ten years ago  when the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (197b)  the world recognized that the process of independence for Namibia had entered a decisive phase  and more than one observer rightly thought that Namibia would soon ' regain its independence. Unfortunately the advocates of apartheid persist in linking independence for Namibia to questions having  nothing to do with it.Mali stands in solidarity with the heroic struggle of the liberation movements in South Africa. We also support the struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  its sole  authentic representative. Hence we have always advocated the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa and the immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Those positions flow from Mali's conviction that peace and harmony can reign in southern Africa only after apartheid is abolished and Namibia has acceded to independence.It is in the name of that peace and that harmony that my country encourages the steps now under way to find appropriate solutions to the other tensions and conflicts that disrupt Africa  in Chad and Western Sahara. In contributing to a positive solution to those various crises  the international community would be doing tremendous service to the peoples of those regions and to Africa as a whole.With regard to the Middle East  Mali is concerned over the tragic fate of Palestinians and the situation in Lebanon. It can never be said too often that the Palestinian question is at the core of the Middle East problem and that peace can never reign in the region until there is a just and lasting solution to the question.Accordingly the international community advocates the convening of an international peace conference in the Middle East. Unfortunately  that proposal has encountered opposition because there is a desire to settle the Palestinian problem without the Palestinian people and the PLO  its sole  legitimate representative.Very near to occupied Palestine and martyred Lebanon  the brother peoples of Iran and Iraq are killing each other. Mali is profoundly concerned over that fratricidal war and repeats its appeal for an end to the tragic conflict. In terms context my delegation hails the recent peace mission of the Secretary-General to the region  and we urge him to persevere in his efforts. Similarly  dialogue must triumph over weapons  and war yield to peace  in Afghanistan and Kampuchea.On the question of the Korean peninsula  Mali has often expressed its position on the matter and supports the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation.Mali is opposed to any partition in Cyprus. That is why my Government supports initiatives to safeguard the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country.Committed to a return to peace in Central America  Mali welcomes the peace agreement concluded on 7 August 1987 in Guatemala City. Furthermore  it encourages the Contadora Group and the Support Group to continue their efforts to bring peace and co-operation to that region.Our peoples want to live in a world where peace will be guaranteed on a lasting basis through genuine disarmament. To that end  we must become convinced of the imperative need to limit defence systems and the geographical proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. My country welcomed the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development and prospects for continued dialogue between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The step-by-step approach to questions will help to establish the climate of mutual trust so essential in the search for appropriate solutions. What is at stake is of vital significance to the human race  to its very survival is in the balance. My delegation welcomed the recommendations made last year to enhance the effectiveness of our Organization. While supporting those recommendations  we emphasize that criteria for choosing measures to implement them must take account of the universality of our Organization and its objectives  which can in no way be identified with those of a commercial enterprise. In this situation  marked by violence and by the continuing and disturbing deterioration in international relations  we must reaffirm that our Organization is an irreplaceable mechanism for the maintenance of international peace and security.Whether it be a question of collective security  dialogue between rich and poor countries  peace and disarmament  or the international economic crisis  our Organization has served as an appropriate forum for the reconciling of views  a place where many answers have been given to many questions.Lastly  the international situation in the economic and political spheres continues to be a matter of serious concernЂ However  day by day man demonstrates that he is able to take action to affect his environment. Perhaps  alongside the prodigious scientific and technical developments  man must get down to dealing with another kind of development  namely  cultural development. We should not confuse such development with that of knowledge or of how to do things. What I refer to is developing our understanding of how to live so that people can accept one another  transcending their differences  so that generosity  solidarity  tolerance and freedom can inspire all people in their daily lives.In any event  our Organization  because of its vocation  can play a role in this new cultural development. May I here reconfirm my country's belief in  and dedication to  those ideals of peace  security  democracy  equality and freedom. "
"93",4659,"MLT",42,1987,"﻿May I begin by congratulating you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. We look on your election  as well as on other elections to office  not as a matter of routine but as an expression of our conviction that each and every Member State has a constructive role to play in the deliberations of this world Assembly  and we are convinced that you will fulfil your role with distinction. Our congratulations go also to the other officers who have been elected  as well as to the outgoing President for his positive contribution in leading the work of the forty-first session. I also wish to pay tribute to the untiring efforts of our Secretary-General  Mr  Perez de Cuellar  for the persistent active role he is playing in the service of the Organization in trying to bring together parties to a number of conflicts to reach negotiated solutions of their problems  such efforts deserve our full support.It has been 20 years since the Head of Government of Malta last addressed the Assembly. The newly elected Government of my country naturally faces hard and urgent tasks at home. But fully conscious that domestic issues should not be allowed to overshadow our equally important role as a member of the international community of nations  I have taken this opportunity to confirm our confidence in the role the United Nations has to play in the maintenance of peace in the world  the enhancement of security for each and every Member State  the substitution of dialogue and negotiations for armed conflict  and the encouragement of co-operation at all levels and across the barriers of race  ideology  size  power and wealth for the welfare of mankind. At the same time  we are fully aware that this potential for positive action has not yet been fully exploited and  indeed  at times it may appear that it has been abused  misused or ignored in the pursuit of perceived national interests.National interests cannot be ignored. We are here as individual nations/ some of us grouped in formal or informal joint defence  economic or regional interests. Yet our presence here should be a declaration of faith in the common interest of humanity beyond the limitations of frontiers  and our main objective should be to harmonize national interests for our mutual benefit.Malta has always believed in these ideals  and our initiative 20 years ago in this Hall  when we launched the idea of the sea and the ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction as being the common heritage of mankind  is evidence of this. The progress of this initiative over the years  under different administrations and in the context of ever-evolving political and economic realities  should encourage us to be both bold in our ideas and more active in pursuing them.My party is now in Government in Malta and my presence here is a confirmation that the same ideals which inspired my predecessor  Mr. George Borg Olivier  guide us today.In this connection I should like to submit two considerations which seem to me to be of real importance in this period between the signing of the Convention on the Law of the Sea and its fully coming into force.The first is that there is a great need for some kind of forum where the representatives of States can meet with those of the United Nations specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations  in order to discuss ocean affairs in an integrated manner. No such forum exists today. Several different proposals worthy of consideration have been advanced to fill this gap. The most important thing is that  in view of the interrelatedness of the multiple uses of ocean space on which the Convention is so insistent  the gap be filled. The second point is that a major result of the Convention  especially with the establishment of the exclusive economic zones  has been the vast extension of national jurisdiction over large areas of ocean space. It is also clear that many nations will however be unable to benefit from the new resources at their disposal  either directly or in co-operation with other nations  unless they are able to establish effective management systems. It is not difficult to realize  however  that many nations will not be able to set up the appropriate national institutions without at least the scientific and technical help of the international community.Let me take this opportunity to expound to this Assembly the policy of my Government and the way it will be manifested in our attitude during this session of the General Assembly and at other international gatherings. The Maltese people believe in democracy  where the rule of law is supreme; where governments change as a result of the freely expressed will of the people at regular elections. We do not take things for granted  and we do not wish to convey any chauvinistic impression. Our belief in a pluralistic democracy has passed through a period of trial  but it has passed the test and it is the stronger because of it.As a result  I speak as the Head of Government of a nation that has recently introduced an important amendment to its Constitution reflecting a consensus in Parliament. Malta is declared today a neutral State actively pursuing peace  security and social progress among all nations by adhering to a policy of non-alignment. We intend to adhere to this constitutional provision and to interpret it with the responsibility and seriousness that it deserves  we want to engender confidence. We mean what we say and we say what we mean.Neutrality does not imply for us a passive disinterested role in all that goes on around us. To start with  we are not colourless in our ideological beliefs and without condemning the beliefs of others we Intend to defend and stand up for the democratic  social and cultural values in which we believe. We attach great importance to human rights and to the freedom to exercise such rights without undue restriction for the benefit of the individual and of the society in which he lives. Such freedom should not be restricted by race  creed or sex and therefore we cannot support the apartheid policy in South Africa  and in so far as it is in our power to do so we shall seek not so much to condemn such a policy verbally as to make a positive contribution towards its elimination. We do not believe that armed conflict is the best way to bring about such changes; simmering confrontation  which inevitably bursts out in armed conflict from time to time  is not to be supported; honest negotiations and constructive dialogue - and the United Nations should be the ideal place for these - should be encouraged. Guided by these ideals  we do not want to be associated with sterile statements of condemnation  especially since routine condemnations tend to become stereotyped and discriminatory in nature. Worse still  they are not likely to make any positive contribution to the initiation of dialogue and resolution of problems.On our agenda we are faced with many situations of conflict  some of which have defied solution for more than a generation. We should not let ourselves fall into the position of accepting such issues as a permanent feature of the international scene. Boldness of vision and a break with routine sterile attitudes is required if solutions are to be found. The change that is required is not so much one of military might or geographical distribution  as one in the minds of men  a change that can best come about by enhancing confidence in one another. We look on the recent agreement in principle between the United States of America and the Soviet Union on the elimination of short- and medium-range nuclear missiles as a positive step along the lines we have just stated. As the representatives of other States have already remarked  we should all be careful to see that the easing of tension at the focal points of confrontation does not lead to an increase in tension on the flanks.The Mediterranean  right in the centre of which Malta sits  is both a focal point of confrontation and the flank of other points of conflict. We do not pretend to have any magic formula for resolving the several  interrelated conflicts and strands of tension that criss-cross that historic sea. What we strongly believe is that allocating blame and mutual accusations are negative in character. All Mediterranean countries  big or small  African  Asian or European  as well as their allies and friends  including those non-regional States with a military presence there  have a role to play. No one can be ignored} no one can impose on others; no imposed solutions  including military ones  will be lasting; and we cannot rely on the passage of time to produce a solution. A solution has to be the product of positive action  through dialogue and negotiations  if need be in an ad hoc international conference in which all interested parties will participate on an equal footing.Mentioning first the Mediterranean in general as an area of conflict that needs urgent consideration does not imply that we are not conscious of other areas that demand our attention. We note with interest and appreciation the efforts put forth by the Secretary-General  the Security Council  the General Assembly itself  regional groupings and individual countries to bring about peaceful solutions to long-festering wounds.Such are the relations between Israel and the Arab States; the sorry state of the Palestinians  who are still denied a State of their own; the plight of war-torn Lebanon  vividly depicted by President Amin Gemayel in this Assembly a little while ago; the escalating and dangerous tension in the Gulf resulting from the long-drawn-out conflict between Iran and Iraq; Afghanistan  which is still occupied by foreign forces; the explosive situation in Central America  not yet pacified by the recent agreement reached by the States of the region; Namibia where the people are still denied self-determination in an era when colonialism is an anachronism; the sorry situation in Kampuchea where foreign troops are still present; Fiji  which recently added another element of uncertainty in that area; and  nearer home  Cyprus  still a divided island.All efforts to defuse tension and bring peace deserve not only our praise  but  more important still  the genuine support of the world community. Each of us in his own way has a role to play; the most powerful States  as well as the other permanent members of the Security Council  have a very special responsibility. As long as they go on enjoying a privileged position in the United Nations  they must also assume special responsibilities. But we would stress that we do not share the simplistic approach of those who view the unfolding world developments in terms of super-Power rivalry only. World expenditure on armaments  usually at the expense of social and economic development  particularly in developing countries  is not attributable solely to super-Power activity. There cannot be flourishing arms producers unless there are also willing arms purchasers; and a surfeit of armaments  be they nuclear or conventional  can only encourage conflict and lead to the temptation of pressing claims and solving issues by the use of those armaments. As a small island with negligible armed forces  we look on this situation with stark realism  fully conscious of its implications for our security  independence and territorial integrity.A common strand in what I have been saying is that while we all face global responsibility - and indeed the United Nations came into being as a direct result of global conflict - many of today's problems are regional in character. The Importance of geographic regions was not lost on the founders of the United Nations  and we have the regional economic and social Commissions. Other regional developments have taken place since then  both within and outside the United Nations system. Perhaps the time has come for a serious study of the role of regional institutions within the United Nations system as a positive and practical contribution to more effective co-operation in the various fields of security and economic and social development. We may have to supplement the present continental regional concept with overlapping but equally valid regional approaches. The Mediterranean is one area which springs to mind automatically  and indeed in the field of environment  progress has already been made. We are happy to host in Malta a United Nations regional oil pollution combating centre.Regional centres for the advancement of marine science and technology ate foreseen in articles 276 and 277 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  but none has so far been established. My Government proposed the setting up of such a centre for the Mediterranean region at the fifth ordinary meeting of the contracting parties to the Barcelona Convention  in Athens last September. We proposed that the centre's structure should be based on the models of the EUREKA and EUROMAR projects. This means  among other things  that both private and public enterprises  as well as national and international organizations  should be involved in the financing of projects judged to be of general benefit. We believe that the Mediterranean region is an ideal context for pilot undertakings of this kind  in which the co-operation of both developing and developed countries is desirable and reciprocally beneficial.I should like to stress the view that funding agencies in the fields of development and co-operation  both national and international  should orient their support much more than hitherto in the direction of scientific research and technological development projects. So far these have tended to be neglected; yet it is in these areas that over time investment is most likely to make the most enduring contribution to bettering the relationship between North and South in a constructive way.Security  independence and territorial integrity are basic to law  order and progress  but unless they lead to improvement in the quality of life and the dignity of the individual they remain hollow words. Indeed  we are all aware of instances of the domination of a people being perpetuated  only the dominators having changed. The world community cannot ignore or condone such developments.However  there are more genuine instances in which  in spite of serious efforts by Governments of independent States  the goal of viable economic and social development has been found to be rather elusive - quite often owing to circumstances over which one has little or no control. When these external causes are dramatic  such as natural disasters  world co-operation tends to be more easily forthcoming than when the causes are chronic and less dramatic. As a European country  Malta looks forward to the time when all Europe  from the Atlantic to the Urals  is united. However  that ideal can be reached only step by step. As a nation with a Western European character  history  culture and way of life  not to mention our overwhelming economic and commercial ties  Malta has had long-established co-operation with the European Economic Community (EEC) through an Agreement of Association. My Government feels that the time has now arrived to seek the right conditions to enable us further to enhance this association by becoming a full member of the Economic Community.It is a well-known fact that political issues cannot be separated from social and economic issues. The development of our economies and our social structure is a corollary of wider political issues. It is a recognized fact that security and development are necessarily interrelated. Malta  as a small developing country  is aware of the unsatisfactory state of the world economy. It is for us a matter of deep concern that the international community has still not resolved such problems as large external and internal imbalances  instability in exchange rates  reduced flows of resources to developing countries  limited access to markets  particularly for the exports of developing countries  and the low prices of primary commodities.In pursuing adjustment programmes and instituting a number of wide-ranging policy measures and reforms  some developing countries have had to undergo tremendous economic and social upheavals. Malta is no exception. As a small developing country with a net import economy and foreign earnings mainly from the export of manufactured goods and tourism  the international economic environment conditions our economy.My country's struggle for economic viability has to be conducted within the constraints of a developing island economy limited by its small size and its lack of resources. It is imperative that friendly countries which are bigger and stronger assist us in overcoming such difficulties.The world economy is passing through a difficult stage  but this should be an added reason for closer co-operation between the developed and the developing countries  the importers and the exporters  the free-market and the centrally planned economies  the commodity producers and consumers. The tendency to protectionism is understood but world progress cannot be achieved unless there is a balance of benefits spread as evenly as possible among the various parties.May I also call upon the organizations and specialized agencies of the United Nations system to increase their financial and technical assistance to Malta. At this point I wish to reiterate my country's disagreement with the criterion which has been adopted by the United Nations system and continues to be the yardstick for assisting small developing countries such as my own  namely  that based on the per capita national income. This has effectively cut off the much-needed resources for the development of my country. While some headway has been made in reversing such a misguided approach  much more is needed in order to bring to fruition the efforts of countries which are dependent on outside assistance in their development process.From time immemorial Malta has been a meeting-place of different cultures. Peoples of different nationalities have transformed our island into a microcosm of world history. The many tourists and personalities who visit our country  with its rich cultural heritage  stable and friendly environment  are agreed that this small island in the Mediterranean could serve as a place where human-resources development could flourish and its national experiences in the educational and technical fields could be fruitfully put at the disposal of other countries. Today I would like to reiterate my Government's willingness to offer Malta as an international centre for academic studies where facilities exist for training programmes  meetings and seminars; where the attempts to achieve understanding through dialogue and negotiations could evolve in a quiet ambiance; where the warm traditional hospitality of the Maltese people could be utilized for the benefit of nationals of other countries. The International Ocean Institute  the Mediterranean Institute and the International Environment Institute are already in place at the service of the International community. The setting up in Malta in the very near future of an institute on aging  within the framework of the United Nations  will enhance further activities in training at all levels in skills relevant to the implementation of the International Plan of Action on Aging.During the last few days the Assembly has been witness to many expressions of support for peace and co-operation among all States; for a halt to armed conflicts; for radical reductions in and in some cases the abolition of  entire categories of nuclear weapons; for the cessation of nuclear tests; for a reduction in military expenditure; for agreements on multilateral arms control; for the improvement of the economic and social conditions of all peoples of the world  in particular those of the developing countries; for the promotion of and respect for human rights; and for other noble causes.Agreement on these complex issues must be pursued vigorously and with a sense of urgency. For 42 years this Organization  with its specialized agencies  has been contributing towards this end. One thing is certain: many problems still exist. While these goals have inspired us all along  we are still far away from an ideal world.Far from being discouraged  we in Malta are determined to carry out an independent foreign policy for the benefit of our people and as a contribution to the peace and stability of our region and the rest of the world. We are friends to all and foes to none  and our aim is to contribute to a peaceful solution of international disputes  renouncing violence and war as an instrument of policy."
"94",4705,"MMR",42,1987,"﻿May I first of all congratulate Ambassador Florin most warmly on his unanimous election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly  The delegation of Burma believes that the deliberations at this session will prove constructive and fruitful under his able guidance  I take this opportunity also to pay a sincere tribute to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury for his most valuable contribution to the work of the Assembly at the preceding session.The regular sessions of the General Assembly have always afforded us a very welcome opportunity to look at the years that have gone by and to look ahead  into the future. During past years  and particularly since the last World War  the winds of change have swept all over the world. We have seen the collapse of colonial empires and the birth of newly independent States. Science and technology - the essential key to modern progress and prosperity - have marched apace with all the attendant developments  both positive and negative  in our international environment. The world's population has been multiplying  and we have witnessed the rising tide of expectations among people throughout the world for such fundamental rights as equality and dignity  sovereignty and independence  peace and security and  above all  economic and social well-being.It is perfectly fitting that the United Nations Charter opens with the solemn vow ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind ..."" and ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"". The provisions of the Charter thus continue to reflect the constantly changing mood and aspirations of present-day human society and the circumstances of our time. This surely is proof of the continuing validity of the Charter principles  which constitute the foundation of our Organization.No aspects of human life have been spared the impact and influence of the forces generated by the constantly changing circumstances of the international environment. Consequently  the history of the post-war years is particularly one of an endless and extremely difficult process of great human endeavours to adjust and readjust to the rapidly changing needs of the time. The United Nations has indeed played a very necessary  an essential role in charting our challenging path towards a more secure and prosperous world. Notwithstanding that fact  the international scene has been clouded by tensions  instability and uncertainties which are very much in evidence wherever we look - in the political and social spheres  in trade and commerce  in transport and communications  and so on.This brings us to the question of international peace and security. The collective security system envisaged in the Chatter is based on the recognition that  by and large  the maintenance of international peace and security depends on the big Powers which have  together or individually  the capability to make or mar its prospects. It was on the basis of that very recognition that the founding fathers of the United Nations saw to it that a special status of permanent membership was conferred upon the big Five in the Security Council  the supreme body in matters of war and peace. Indeed  the grim reality of today is also the continued dominance of the super-Powers in international relations.Unfortunately  the harmony that marked the relationship between the big Powers when the Charter was being hammered out in San Francisco and before  diminished rapidly after the conclusion of the Second World War. Meanwhile  the problems that confront our Organization have increased many fold  broadened in scope and become increasingly complex. Any effort to promote peace and security in any part of the world can be restricted by sheer indifference or greatly enhanced by the support of the big Powers. A certain degree of understanding between them is essential before we can hope to gain tangible results in any peace-making process.The foremost issue of international concern is the prevention of a war in which nuclear weapons will be used. This is a common danger that all countries face and no national security policy can protect States from that threat  for the dynamics of a nuclear war know no sanctuary. In past wars it was possible to destroy a village  a town or even a country. Now  nuclear weapons threaten all mankind in its planetary dimension. So long as nuclear weapons exist there can be no guarantee that they will not be used and we cannot dismiss the possibility of an outbreak of nuclear war due to accident  miscalculation or failure of communication. World peace and security cannot endure indefinitely in conditions in which the spiralling of the arms race  particularly the nuclear arms race  continues without respite. The attainment of general disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons are issues of paramount importance not only to the major Powers but to all other countries of the world.The United Nations came into existence a few short weeks only before the age of nuclear weapons and the implications of the nuclear age were not fully anticipated when the Charter was constituted. However  the collective security envisaged therein  born of the realization of the Second World War  requires that nations settle their differences by peaceful means without resource to arms  and is to be realized through disarmament.From all accounts the bilateral process of disarmament negotiations has not only been intensified but also accelerated recently. In our view  these are steps in the right direction worthy of universal acclaim and we are encouraged by the present course of developments.The situation in the Middle East and its implications for international peace and security continue to be of concern to the United Nations. The international community has reiterated year after year that the success of the continuing search for peace in the Middle East lies in the solution of the Palestine problem. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) remain valid as embodying the principles for a just and comprehensive settlement. These  indeed  are essential prerequisites for a peaceful solution. Moreover  central to the solution of the problem is recognition of the right of all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to regain their national rights  including the right to sovereignty and independence.The viable option towards the path to peace lies in a negotiated settlement among all the parties concerned. That is why the idea that has once again been gaining ground of the convening of an international peace conference and the need for the Security Council to take initiatives on this matter is indeed a positive development.Lebanon is still tottering under the impact of external encroachment upon its sovereignty and independence. The two major Powers in the region  Iran and Iraq  have been fiercely locked in armed hostilities. The situation in the entire region of the Middle East is really ominous. Unless timely action can be taken to bring them under control there is a very real danger of the hostilities spilling over to other areas  thereby engulfing all the countries in the region. The delegation of Burma highly commends the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General with a view to bringing about a process of negotiation in the spirit of the Charter and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.The Assembly continues to witness a situation in South Africa in which there is no sign of improvement as the country's regime continues  by the perpetuation of the system of apartheid  to deny the majority its rights as a people. The illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African regime continues to deprive the people of that country of their independence  and its acts of aggression against and territorial violations of neighbouring countries pose a continuing threat to the peace and stability of the region. South Africa shows no inclination to begin the process of peaceful dialogue. The international community has condemned apartheid with one voice and the need has been recognized for a concerted course of action by the United Nations consistent with Chapter VII of the Charter  to exercise pressure in a peaceful way so that the South African regime may abandon its present policies and practices.Nearly a decade has passed since  as a result of foreign intervention and occupation  the peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan were deprived of their independence and the right of self-determination. The restoration of their rights has been consistently on the agenda of the United Nations. Moreover  the peoples of those two countries have suffered much  and that has given a humanitarian dimension to the problem. Although the situations are somewhat similar in their basic character  they arose out of particular developments and circumstances in the region and their solution lies in resolving the problems of each country within the regional context. The similarity is that the solutions to the problems would require the complete withdrawal of foreign forces and a negotiated settlement of a comprehensive character between the parties concerned. Despite the complexity of the issues  the United Nations General Assembly has  year after year ř adopted resolutions  with the support of the vast majority  embodying the principles and modalities for a just and negotiated settlement.Burma has consistently supported the General Assembly resolutions on Kampuchea and Afghanistan since it believes that peaceful settlements on the basis of those resolutions would create the conditions for the restoration of the right to national sovereignty and self-determination of these two peoples.With regard to the situation in Kampuchea  the implications for regional peace and stability are of particular concern. We believe that the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Kampuchean people would create conditions favourable to the mutual trust and understanding which are essential for the realization of regional co-operation on peace and development. At the same time a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan would also create conditions for peace within the region  which in turn would enhance the prospects for the solution of international issues with global dimensions.The performance of the world economy has been sluggish for some time. Two years ago  three major factors - namely  the fall in the price of oil  the value of the dollar and interest rates - gave rise to some hopes for more vigorous growth in 1986 and 1987. The general assessment now is that these hopes did not materialize in 1986 and that the prospects for 1987 are also far from bright. Developing countries generally rely on their export of primary commodities to earn the precious hard currency for financing their investment projects and essential imports. The dramatic decline in the prices of primary commodities started some 10 years ago and has continued without much interruption. They have subsequently fallen even faster. This situation is true for most primary commodities  agriculture and forest products and minerals and metals alike. On the other hand  the developing countries have to pay ever higher prices for the import of manufactured goods from developed industrialized countries. These factors naturally set in motion a chain reaction of adverse effects for all developing countries in terms of their capacity to save  to import and to invest  thereby creating grave difficulties in their balance of payments and terms of trade and necessitating resort to more and more borrowing abroad.This is how the developing countries come to be overburdened with an immense volume of international debt and debt-servicing needs  which has the effect of dissipating the most energetic efforts of the developing countries in their search for a viable economy  which proves elusive. Over-indebtedness and an increasingly deteriorating balance of payments and trade cannot be expected to be confined to any country or group of countries or to any sector or sectors of the world's economy. They cannot but be pervasive and far-reaching in effect. This has indeed been evident in the difficulties encountered world-wide by both developing and developed countries  and also in the recent upheavals caused to the international banking and financial institutions.At this points to only one conclusion if we are to overcome the present economic difficulties - be they trade and aid  money and finance or development - all Member States must work together in a spirit of co-operation in order to explore ways and means for the effective reversal of the current trend and place the world on the path of sustained and balanced growth.Last year the United Nations faced a crisis in its history which ostensibly was financial in nature but the root cause of which apparently went deeper. Out of such difficulties arose an opportunity for the United Nations to improve its administrative and financial efficiency  which led to a decision on a broad range of measures. My delegation believes that the agreement is the first essential step in the implementation of the measures necessary to improve the structural and financial efficiency of the United Nations. It was without doubt due to a spirit of accommodation on all sides that consensus prevailed on such a broad and complex issue. The decisions reached go far beyond organizational reforms. It can be said that they constitute a commitment on the part of all Members to the view that a viable and effective United Nations is needed if it is to serve the noble purpose for which it was intended. Such a commitment requires that Member States fulfil their financial obligations under the Charter. The decision last year to reform the United Nations system was a step in the long-term effort in which we all should persevere. What is essentially necessary is a spirit of accommodation and co-operation which should continue to prevail for the effective implementation of that reform.The delegation of Burma fully sympathizes with the Secretary-General  who must lead the Organization at this critical phase. We wish him all success in his tireless efforts to bring about the requisite consensus and spirit of mutual accommodation with a view to resolving the current problems. The delegation of Burma hopes that the deliberations of the current session will go a long way to infuse renewed vigour into the work of the Organization."
"95",4762,"MNG",42,1987,"﻿Permit me  on behalf of the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic and on my own behalf most warmly to congratulate Mr. Peter Florin on his election to the high post of President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-second session. This great honour confers on him by the international community is a recognition of his rich experience as a diplomat and also a tribute to the prominent role of the German Democratic Republic in world politics and in the cause of strengthening universal peace and security. We are confident that under his skilful leadership this session of the General Assembly will achieve fresh success and concrete results in its work. At the same time I should like to express our gratitude to your predecessor  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  Mr. Choudhury  for his skilful conduct of the proceedings of the previous session of the General Assembly.Our delegation would like to take this opportunity once again to wish the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  good health and every success in his tireless work.The general debate at this session of the United Nations General Assembly naturally mirrors the complex world situation and the most urgent problems of our time. Deep anxieties over the destiny of mankind are juxtaposed with guarded hopes for a turn for the better in international relations.A confrontational approach arising from the policy of duress  neo-globalism and the settling of old scores still dominates the statements by representatives of the leading Western Power and some of its closest allies. In this way history is deliberately distorted and truth is unscrupulously trampled underfoot.On the other hand  it is clear that a constructive and responsible approach  a spirit of dialogue and negotiation  which takes into account the realities of the nuclear age is steadily gaining ground. Such an encouraging change is the result of the tireless efforts of the socialist countries  the non-aligned nations  and all other peace-loving forces that advocate a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world.Today these forces can only feel satisfaction and optimism at the recent agreement in principle reached between the Soviet Union and the United States on the elimination of their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles. The realization of such an agreement will constitute an important break in the vicious circle of the arms race and a first step towards genuine nuclear disarmament. An important supplement to this is the Soviet-American agreement on the establishment of centres for the reduction of the risks of nuclear war.	 The joint soviet-American statement of 18 September 1987 gives us hope that the two sides will make further efforts to work out a treaty on the reduction of strategic weapons in the spirit of the talks at Reykjavik while preserving the anti-ballistic missile Treaty. Similarly there is a prospect of full-scale and step-by—step negotiations on the prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests.The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic hopes that ell these changes will pave the way for realization of the Soviet programme on the step-by-step elimination of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000. Such a hope is strengthened by the tangible progress being made at the negotiations on the prohibition of chemical weapons.In our view  progress in these directions will give real impetus to the efforts for the implementation of the proposals put forward by the State  parties to the Warsaw Treaty for a substantial reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments from the Atlantic to the Urals  The carrying out of the initiatives advanced by the German Democratic Republic  Poland  Czechoslovakia and other European States for the establishment in the centre and other parts of Europe of corridors and zones free from nuclear  chemical and other weapons  and free also from the concentration of armed forces  has now become a matter of immediate urgent and practical significance as a first step towards the attainment of this goal.The article by Comrade Gorbachev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Onion  ""Reality and safeguards for a secure world""  contains a comprehensive programme of measures for the elimination of the danger of war and for the establishment of a reliable system of international security through the collective efforts of all states under the auspices of the United Nations. To our mind  this document further elaborates and develops.  In the new circumstances  the ideas and objectives of the historical Decree of Peace proclaimed on the day following the victory of the October Socialist Revolution  the seventieth anniversary of which is observed this year by progressive people everywhere. This major event of the twentieth century ushered in an era of freedom  independence and social progress of peoples. It has made peace and peaceful co-existence a State policy. Further testimony to this is the military doctrine of socialism proclaimed by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. The process of restructuring and the acceleration of socialist construction currently under way in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries strengthens the material foundations of universal peace and security.The Mongolian Peopled Republic holds the view that the implementation of practical disarmament measures will pave the way for the creation of a crucial component of a comprehensive system of international security  namely  in the military and political fields. Another element of such a component is the removal of hotbeds of tension and conflict.My Government is in favour of enhancing the emerging positive trends towards convening an international conference on the Middle East  and of an immediate and just settlement of the situation on the basis of ensuring the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  and an effective guarantee of the national independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon and other States of the region. We believe that United action by Arab countries and cohesion in the ranks of the Palestinian resistance movement are of crucial importance in the attainment of this goal.The policy of national reconciliation and the constructive international action set in motion by the Governments of Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Nicaragua have created favourable conditions for a political settlement of the situations caused by the intrigues of imperialist forces and their regional accomplices against these countries. The right of the peoples of these countries to develop along the path they have chosen must be respected by all. Good will and realism should be matched by a positive response and must not be exploited for selfish and imperialistic ends.The Mongolian People's Republic has consistently supported the constructive efforts exerted by the countries of Indochina  the Contadora and Lima groups  and the Sandinista Government  and by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his representatives to bring about a political settlement of the situation in these hotspots. My Government also supports the steps taken by the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  in pursuance of the Security Council resolution on the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. Mongolia associates itself with the appeal for an immediate end to this fratricidal war. The Mongolian delegation has  on more than one occasion  stated from this rostrum that the collusion of imperialist and racist forces is the main cause of the aggravation of the situation in southern Africa. The Mongolian People's Republic condemns their subversive acts against Angola  Mozambique and other front-line States and supports the struggle of African countries and of the Organization of African Unity for the strengthening of peace  independence in the continent  and social progress.My delegation is in favour of the immediate granting of independence to the people of Namibia and of the eradication of the apartheid regime in South Africa. We resolutely reject attempts to link the solution of the question of Namibia with the withdrawal from Angola of the Cuban internationalist servicemen.Mongolia favours the strengthening of the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and the immediate removal of the foreign military presence in its territory.Disarmament measures and an improvement in the international situation in different parts of the world create favourable conditions for the solution of the problems of economic and social development. That truth has been abundantly proved by the outcome of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development held recently under the auspices of the United Nations.The possibility of ensuring the economic and social security of States on a global scale depends  in our view  on transforming their economic interdependence into genuinely equal and mutually beneficial co-operation among all countries in the interest of solving the cardinal problems of human progress. The Berlin declaration of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  of 29 May 1987  envisages ways and means of solving these problems  in particular the most pressing issues; the overcoming of the underdevelopment of developing countries and the establishment of a new international economic order. Within the context of advancing those objectives  Mongolia takes a favourable view of the results of the extraordinary ministerial conference of non-aligned countries on South-South co-operation.Proposing that concerted efforts be made towards the creation of the foundations of a comprehensive system of international security  the socialist countries urge the world community to work for a common response to the challenges of the nuclear age. There is no alternative to collective and equal security for all and to peaceful coexistence on the basis of respect for the right of peoples to choose their own way of life and for the right to peaceful and constructive work.We do this in the spirit of the United Nations Charter and in the awareness of the need for the development and practical implementation of its provisions under new conditions. We are also drawing on the experience accumulated so far in international relations. The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Harare declarations of the non-aligned countries ace important assets in this regard. We believe that those documents  among others  can serve as important basic sources for working out a concept and the content of a comprehensive system of security.The report of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues  set up by the United Nations General Assembly in 1982 and headed by the late Olof Palme  deserves greater attention. That report  entitled ""Common security -a programme for disarmament""  draws the conclusions that the well-worn path of military competition is a blind alley and that  in the nuclear age  nations cannot achieve security at each other's expense and must begin to organize their security policies in co-operation with each other. In its foreign policy  the Mongolian People's Republic proceeds from the assumption that the strengthening of trust  mutual understanding and co-operation in the Asia-Pacific region has become extremely significant and important for the creation of a comprehensive system of international security. The vast network of economic  scientific and technical potential of the Soviet Union  the United States  Japan  China  India  Australia and the so-called newly industrialized States provides a unique material basis for the development of multifaceted co-operation for the benefit of all  in the interests of strengthening peace and security in the region.The Soviet Union in its 1986 Vladivostok initiative and in the replies by Mikhail Gorbachev to the questions of the Indonesian newspaper Merdeka in July 1987  put forward wide-ranging proposals for building regional international relations precisely along those lines. Those proposals are designed to remove hotbeds of tension and conflict by peaceful means  to reduce the intensity of political and military confrontation in different parts of the region and to develop mutually beneficial co-operation on an equal footing.Stressing the broad practical significance of the Soviet initiatives  our leader  Comrade Batmunkh  has pointed out that the realization of those initiatives undoubtedly would not only promote the strengthening of the security of the States of the region and the achievement of the universal aspirations for a nuclear-weapon-free world  but would also reduce tension  mistrust and the danger of the outbreak of new conflicts and would make sea and air communication routes in vast areas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans safer. Peaceful proposals by the socialist countries and other countries are of particular urgency in the light of the deteriorating situation in the Asia-Pacific region. Militarist and revenge-seeking circles are seeking to turn the region into a new breeding-ground for confrontation with socialist countries and other peace-loving States. Here  the United States first-strike nuclear and missile weapons are being built up increasingly on land  sea and under water and a dangerous partnership is taking shape in plans for the miniaturization of outer space. Attempts are being stepped up to destabilize the situation in progressive and peace-loving States  as is interference in their internal affairs.On the other hand  we have observed many events  many trends  which would indicate that ideas of improving the situation and expanding peaceful co-operation in the region are making headway.The realization of the agreement  in principle  on the elimination of Soviet-American medium- and shorter-range missiles on a global double zero basis  will have an exceedingly favourable impact on the situation in the region.There has been further noticeable improvement in the relations between the USSR and the People's Republic of China in the political  economic and other spheres and this is of great significance for an improvement of the international situation.Vietnam  Kampuchea and Laos have added new impetus to their efforts to improve relations with the People's Republic of China and with the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and for turning South-East Asia into a zone of peace  stability and co-operation. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a number of new initiatives designed to eliminate tension on the Korean peninsula and in the Par East and to create the conditions necessary for the peaceful reunification of Korea. We consider particularly timely its proposal for a stage-by-stage reduction of armed forces of the North and South along with the simultaneous withdrawal of American troops and weapons from South Korea. My delegation associates itself with the view that only a reunified Korea could become a Member of the United Nations.The entry into force of the Rarotonga Treaty  which consolidates the process of converting the South Pacific into a nuclear-weapon-free zone  is a significant event in the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons in the Asia-Pacific region. The Mongolian People's Republic calls upon the United States  the United Kingdom and Prance to follow the example of the Soviet Union and China  which have signed the relevant Additional Protocols to the Treaty. My Government supports the struggle of the countries of the region to put an end to nuclear tests in the Pacific.The movement to turn South-East Asia and the Indian Ocean into a nuclear-weapon-free zone and a zone of peace has been intensified. Our country supports the efforts made by India  Indonesia and other States to that end. The Soviet-Indian Declaration of Principles for a Nuclear-Weapon-Free and Non-Violent World represents a major political step in the promotion of new political thinking. Broader application of the spirit of that Declaration in the relations between States of the region would be of great significance for the cause of strengthening international security.The Mongolian People's Republic is endeavouring to promote confidence and mutual understanding and the development of good-neighbourly relations among countries of the Asia-Pacific region and actively supports all constructive initiatives to that end. Mongolia  in its turn  is taking concrete steps to promote its idea of establishing international machinery designed to rule out effectively the use of force in the relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific.The withdrawal by mutual consent in April-June this year of a substantial part of the limited contingent of Soviet troops temporarily stationed in Mongolia at the request of my Government serves to strengthen the atmosphere of trust and mutual understanding in the region.A number of important international meetings of State and public representatives of countries of the region have been held recently in ray country on the problems of strengthening peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. Our relations with the countries of the region have been considerably expanded and the level of political dialogue with many of them has been raised. My Government will continue to make efforts to promote the strengthening of mutual understanding  good-neighbourly relations and co-operation among the countries of the region.The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic believes that the role of the United Nations has increased as never before as an instrument for the maintenance of international peace and as a centre for harmonizing the efforts of States with a view to finding appropriate solutions to universal problems. It reiterated once again its consistent support for the activities of the United Nations during the memorable visit of the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  to my country in May this year. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic attaches great significance to the broad range of ideas and concrete proposals contained in the article I have mentioned by Mr  Mikhail Gorbachev on enhancing the role of the United Nations in strengthening world peace and in establishing the foundations of a comprehensive system of international security. In the opinion of my delegation  the proposal of the United Nations Secretary-General on the establishment in this Organization of a multilateral centre on the reduction of the risks of war and his ideas concerning regional centres for the promotion of peace and disarmament are timely. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic shares his view that outer space should remain free of weapons. We maintain that while developing international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space it is imperative to pay particular attention to the strengthening of international instruments prohibiting the use of space for military purposes  especially the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States In the Exploration and Use of Outer Space  including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.The Mongolian People's Republic considers that the time is ripe for our Organization to deal with matters relating to the prevention of an extremely dangerous potential type of terrorism  namely  nuclear terrorism  by adventurist elements.The adoption at this session of the General Assembly of the declaration on the enhancement of the effectiveness of the principle of non-use of force in international relations would constitute a practical contribution by the United Nations to the reinforcement of the concept of equal security for all. It would also promote the practical implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security and of the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace  previously adopted by the United Nations. My delegation hopes that this session of the General Assembly will mark an important milestone towards the achievement of the goals of enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations in implementing the provisions of its Charter. For its part my delegation will do its utmost to promote the success of the work of the session.In conclusion I should like to announce that the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic  as a token of its consistent support for United Nations activities  has decided to make a voluntary contribution of $US 20 U0U during 1987 and 1988  bearing in mind the financial difficulties the United Nations is at present experiencing. Certainly  the sum is very modest; nevertheless I hope the motives behind the gesture will be clear to all who are conscious of the need to lend every support to our Organization. "
"96",4804,"MOZ",42,1987,"﻿It is for me a great honour to address this Assembly  an important forum in the struggle for the preservation of peace and the consolidation of friendship and solidarity among peoples. The United Nations plays an essential role in easing world tension and containing conflicts. It is the cornerstone of closer diplomatic ties between Member States and of the struggle for progress and development.In addressing the forty-second session of the General Assembly I should like to express my delight at seeing the presidency in your hands  Sir  you are an experienced diplomat who has achieved a high standing in international relations and I am confident that the present session of the General Assembly will benefit greatly from your wisdom and even-handedness. I should like to pledge my country's determination to co-operate closely with you in carrying out your duties.I also congratulate the President of the forty-first session  Mr. Huraayun Rasheed Choudhury  Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  on the energy he devoted in bringing that session to a successful conclusion. I have the pleasure of conveying a message of appreciation and recognition from the Mozambican people to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. Your commitment and devotion to the search for solutions to problems besetting humankind have earned you  Mr. Secretary-General  the admiration and esteem accorded to great international personalities. Your name will forever be associated with the international community's efforts aimed at seeking solutions to serious problems obtaining in southern Africa. Your name will be particularly associated with all that has been done to relieve the human suffering caused by natural calamities and the war of aggression against Mozambique.Ten years ago the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique  Marshal Samora Moises Machel  addressed this Assembly for the first time. We brought a message from a country that  having just won its independence by force of arms  fully understood the need for peace to build a future of prosperity and well-being. Samora Machel devoted all his energies to the search for solutions to southern Africa's problems.On 19 October 1986 Samora Machel was returning from yet another mission for peace and development when the aircraft in which he was travelling was diverted from its normal route by an unregistered radio beacon (WR). As a result of that diversion  the aircraft crashed in South African territory  causing the death of President Samora Machel and 34 people accompanying him. We are convinced that this radio beacon (VOR) was deliberately installed and operated with criminal Intent. The Mozambican Government reaffirms its determination to pursue the investigation until the whole truth is revealed. Those who assassinated Samora Machel are the enemies of peace  progress and justice. Those who killed Samora Machel are the enemies of the purposes that guide the United Nations. In evoking the memory of President Samora Machel  I should like to thank all those who  in those tragic moments  enveloped us in the mantle of their sympathy and strengthened our determination to pursue the struggle for peace.My country continues to experience a difficult situation brought about by an undeclared war waged against us by South Africa. With repeated massacres and massive destruction of our social and economic infrastructures  this war of aggression  which initially was led by the racist and minority regime of Ian Smith of the then Rhodesia and was taken over in 1981 by the apartheid regime of South Africa  has reached an unprecedented scale. At various moments this war has involved either direct military aggression by the South African armed forces or attacks by mercenaries and terrorists recruited  trained  armed  directed and supported by Pretoria. As a backdrop to this war  and using the vast financial and technological resources at its disposal  the apartheid regime resorts to threats  blackmail  economic blockade  sabotage and a campaign of d is in formation and calumny against our country.The Nkomati Agreement  signed in 1984 by the People's Republic of Mozambique and South Africa with a view to establishing a climate of peace and good neighbourliness between the two countries  has not yet fully achieved its purpose. As the Gorongosa documents have amply demonstrated. South Africa  instead of ceasing its involvement in the aggression against Mozambique  has escalated the infiltration of terrorists into our country and increased military support to them. Despite the unmasking of this scheme  through the irrefutable evidence provided by the Gorongosa documents  Pretoria has remained captive to its plan of waging an undeclared war against Mozambique  Despite the immense propaganda effort made by the circles that finance the armed banditry in an attempt to give it an acceptable face  these terrorists and mercenaries in the pay of Pretoria remain faithful to their criminal  anti-social and anti-national character. That is proved by  among other things  the massacres perpetrated by the terrorists in Homoine  Manjacaze  Mandimba  Mechungwe and Sena. It is proved by the destruction of property and social and economic infrastructures and by the looting  robbery  rape and sadistic mutilation of defenceless populations.Without being exhaustive  the following are some of the nefarious effects of the attacks perpetrated by the terrorists: From 1982 to 1986  the terrorists destroyed or looted 1 500 shops and consumer co-operatives  1 800 schools  affecting 315 000 students; 490 hospitals  health posts and centres  affecting more than 2 million citizens  who lost access to regular health care. In the same period  more than half a million people died as a direct or indirect result of the terrorist attacks; more than half of this total is made up of children below the age of five.But who are these criminals that indiscriminately sow death and destruction? Who are these murderers that  under the command of foreigners  brutalize and massacre the Mozambican people? Who are these terrorists - or armed bandits  as they have become known in Mozambique and throughout southern Africa? They are agents of colonialism who were always opposed to the liberation struggle of the Mozambican people and who  after the triumph of this struggle in 1974  desperately attempted to prevent the realization of our rights to self-determination and independence. In their ranks we find drug addicts  thieves  outlaws and criminals  mercenaries and murderers. Their creation and leadership were dictated by objectives and interests foreign and hostile to the most legitimate aspirations of the Mozambican people. On the testimony of their very creator  the former head of Rhodesia's intelligence service  Ken Flower  this group was formed in 1974 in Ian Smith's Rhodesia  It was created as a pseudo-guerrilla movement based on Ken Flower's experience gained from the Portuguese array in Angola. To this pseudo-movement the Rhodesia secret services gave the name of MNR in the middle of 1976.As a consequence of the war Pretoria is waging against us  and of the natural calamities that affect our country  4.5 million Mozambicane have been displaced inside the country or have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. In the face of this catastrophe  the international community has shown gratifying understanding and solidarity. On the initiative of the Secretary-General  and in response to our appeal  an international meeting on humanitarian assistance to Mozambique was held earlier this year. As a result. United Nations specialized agencies  governmental and non-governmental institutions  humanitarian and religious bodies have been giving our country precious support in foodstuffs  clothing  medicine  seeds and tools. Thanks to this programme  it has already been possible to save the lives of thousands of Mozambicane.On behalf of the Mozambican people  I thank all the donor countries and the entire international community for the support given our country  without this support it would have been impossible for us to cope with the countless difficulties faced by the population displaced by war or returning from neighbouring countries where they had sought refuge. The war in southern Africa is a creation of the apartheid regime. The forces that carry out the massacres are an extension of Pretoria's army. The South African regime wants to subjugate the whole of southern Africa. That is very obvious to the countries in the region. Therefore  Zimbabweans and Tanzaniane are today fighting in Mozambique  side by side with Mozambicane  against South African aggression  in operations that have the logistical support of Angola  Zambia and Botswana. The front-line States understand that what is at stake in Mozambique is the future of the region as a whole. The war being waged against Mozambique is a struggle between freedom and oppression  between equality and racial discrimination  between independence and colonialism.Even beyond the borders of the front-line States  we are beginning to note positive signs of co-operation intended to bring an end to this terrorism. That is the case of Malawi  with which we have signed a security agreement that is being implemented with positive results.The broad movement of solidarity we enjoy from member States of the Organization of African Unity  the Non-Aligned Movement and the international community in general strengthens our determination to fight and our confidence to Our economy reveals deep structural and conjectural distortions  as a consequence of a combination of factors such as the financial and trade imbalances  the unprecedented reduction in prices of commodities which constitute the main source of revenue for developing countries  unemployment  the disproportionate increase in the prices of manufactures from industrialized countries  high real interest rates  the adoption of protectionist measures that hamper the access of exports from developing countries to developed countries' markets  recurring hunger that affects millions of human beings  the critical situation inherited from colonialism; the losses occasioned by the implementation of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia direct and indirect military aggression and economic blockade pursued by South Africa; natural calamities  and our managerial shortcomings in the implementation of our economic policy  as recognized by the Fourth Congress of our Party.Of all those factors  it is the war of aggression being waged against us by the South African regime that most aggravates our economic and financial difficulties.Between 1975  the year we became independent  and 1981 we scored successes in our national reconstruction. During this period our gross domestic product achieved a reasonable annual growth rate. Our exports reached a peak of $OS 280.8 million. In the field of education  the illiteracy rate  which was 92 per cent at the time of independence  was reduced to 72 per cent by 1980. Our success in the field of health resulted in the establishment of 900 rural health posts. In 1981  for the first time in our country's history  every district had the services of a health professional able to provide diagnosis and treatment.Significant achievements were registered in many other economic  social and cultural fields. It is those successes that are being threatened by the escalation of South African aggression.Between 1981 and 1985 our economy registered a decline every year  which brought a decrease in standards of living and an increase in our foreign debt.Analysing our situation  we concluded that  although the war was the main aggravating factor in our economic crisis  we could not wait until its end to adopt fundamental measures to deal with and overcome the crisis. On the contrary  rehabilitating our economy was a condition of paramount importance for us to win the war. So at the beginning of this year our Government devised an economic recovery programme that envisages  among others  the following measures: a new system of exchange control that encourages exporters! the abolition of price control on some goods; incentive to producers by means of an increase in the prices of produce; better management methods in the co-operatives; reorganization and rationalization of some State farms  with a resultant redistribution of land to the family sector  co-operatives and private farmers; and a new salary policy  with the aim of increasing productivity. The goal of this four-year programme is to revitalize the national economy and to obtain a level of growth in gross domestic product of the order of 12 per cent by 1990. The assessment made of the first six months of implementation of the economic recovery programme has been encouraging. In the first six months of this year  industrial production rose by 34 per cent over the same period last year. Furthermore# there is likely to be a rise of 12 to 15 per cent in agricultural marketing this year over 1986  owing mainly to an increase in production in the family sector.In general  we note that the various economic elements are reacting in a positive way to the measures that have been taken and there are indications of a trend towards an overall recovery in our economy. It should be pointed out that there is inevitably a high social cost to be paid for the adoption of an economic programme such as this one.The international economic crisis  the impact of the war imposed on us by Pretoria  and the disproportionate increase in foreign debt servicing that absorbs or even exceeds our export earnings have all meant that Mozambique  like many other developing countries  finds itself in a strait-jacket of foreign debt which  little by little  is restraining our efforts and initiatives.To complement our national efforts  we have negotiated the rescheduling of our debt. In May of this year we came to a better understanding  and the terms agreed on were reasonably favourable.The recent meeting of the Consultative Group for Mozambique resulted in encouraging promises of new resources to revive our economy and sustain a new start. However  we note that in reality a large part of the additional resources will enter our country only to leave almost immediately in the form of payments of outstanding obligations. We therefore add our voice to the growing demand for profound reforms in international financial and economic relations and for lasting  effective and equitable solutions.In this context  we share the views held by many countries  organizations and personalities  such as the Vatican  on an ethical approach to the issue of international indebtedness that emphasizes the need for both creditor and debtor countries to share equitably in the sacrifices and efforts required by the adjustment programmes  and criticizes the prescription of authoritarian and technocratic measures that do not take into account the particular circumstances of each country. This view reinforces the authoritative stand taken in favour of an equitable settlement of the debt of the developing countries.Some of these concerns are echoed in the Venice Declaration made by the seven industrialized countries  which shows an awareness of the need to encourage structural changes and to review the intolerable interest rates. It is my hope that this awareness will generate the necessary will to work out a just and equitable solution of the debt problem.The undeclared war waged against Mozambique by South Africa is part of the latter’s strategy of domination of the whole of southern Africa. The twin vectors of this strategy are to maintain the essence of apartheid within the country  on the one hand  and to impose South Africa's hegemony on the region  on the other. This hegemony has been challenged by the triumph of the national liberation struggle in Angola  Mozambique and Zimbabwe.The attempts to mask apartheid through cosmetic reforms that do not change the essence of the system are firmly opposed by the South African people. The South African people are not struggling for the modernization of the racist regime: they are fighting for a democratic society in which all women and men have equal rights and duties  and where all - black  white  Coloured and Asian - are simply citizens of one country. The declaration of a state of emergency  the strikes  the demonstrations and the mass arrests are clear signs of the failure of the reformist option in South Africa. In response to the popular uprising  the regime is becoming more deeply entrenched in obstinacy and violence. It has now become more obvious to the international community that Pretoria is not sensitive to the demands of the South African people for freedom and democracy and that it refuses to negotiate the end of the apartheid system.The international community must firmly support the struggle of the South African people under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ÄNC) and other democratic forces in South Africa. It should  moreover  exert effective pressure on the South African regime to persuade it to accept the only peaceful means of solving the conflict  namely  to abolish the racist laws  to free Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  to legalize the ANC and other democratic political bodies  and to negotiate with them the political future of the country.We note  with satisfaction  that wider and wider circles in the South African white community understand the need to tread this path. The movement against apartheid inside South Africa draws to its ranks thousands of white South Africans  especially the young  who want to destroy the artificial barriers imposed by racism and to play a role in building a non-racial and democratic society. Significant political  economic  social  cultural and religious circles in the white community are establishing contacts with the ANC in the hope of finding a solution to the problem of South Africa. Since its independence in 1975  the People's Republic of Angola has been facing devastating invasion and attacks carried out directly by the South African armed forces. It is the duty of the Assembly to reaffirm its condemnation of the South African aggression against Angola and to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the South African regime's troops. We reiterate our fraternal solidarity with the people and Government of the People's Republic of Angola.Regarding Namibia  we pay a tribute to the recent proposals made by the People's Republic of Angola aimed at bringing to an end South Africa's aggression and occupation of parts of Angolan territory and creating conditions conducive to a negotiated settlement of the issue of Namibia. We once again reject the policy of ""linkage"" and demand immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We salute the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole  legitimate representative of the Namibian people  who are struggling with courage and determination for Namibia's independence.It is encouraging for us to note that there is  on the part of the international community  an increasingly clear understanding of the real nature of the conflict and the difficulties southern Africa faces. Evidence of this can be found in the growing support that the front-line States enjoy in their efforts to establish a lasting peace in the region. The international community must ensure the strengthening of the defence capability of the countries in the region so that they may effectively face South Africa's aggression.The international community in general and the Western countries in particular should make a firm commitment to promote the economic and social development of the independent countries of southern Africa. This commitment could find expression through bilateral or multilateral channels  particularly within the framework of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC)  which has shown itself to be a valuable instrument in the struggle for economic emancipation and to lessen our dependence on South Africa.The proliferation of conflicts in Africa  the Middle East  Asia and Latin America  the continuous growth in stockpiles of nuclear arms and other means of mass destruction  the steadily widening gap between developed and developing nations - all are issues that represent a grave threat to the future and the very survival of mankind.Despite the efforts made by our Organization in the promotion of peace and international security  it has to be admitted that the progress achieved so far is modest.On the African continent  the occupation of parts of the territory of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and the denial of the right of the Sahraoui people to self-determination and independence continue. We are still convinced that solution of this problem will be made possible by implementing the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations. We reiterate our support for and solidarity with the Sahraoui people.Speaking of the conflict between Chad and Libya  we regard as positive the acceptance by both parties of a cease-fire  as announced in Ethiopia by the current Chairman of the OAU. Similarly  we hope that Chad and Libya will co-operate with the efforts of the ad hoc committee that recently met at the summit level in the Zambian capital  Lusaka.Regarding the issue of the Middle East  the People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms its support for the just cause of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  their sole  legitimate representative: the establishment of a free  independent and sovereign State. We favour the convening of an international conference on the Middle East as a step towards a negotiated settlement of this question.We demand that Israel withdraw its forces from all Arab territories occupied since 1967 and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the States of the region  including Lebanon.We renew our appeal to the Governments of Iran and Iraq to bring to an end the fratricidal war that is devastating both countries and to co-operate with the United Nations endeavours for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.We support the efforts being made by the Secretary-General with a view to helping the two Cypriot communities find a just solution to the problem of Cyprus without foreign interference.The Asian continent continues to suffer from violence and war.We urge the withdrawal of foreign forces occupying the territory of East Timor  in order that the Timorese people may freely exercise their right to self-determination and independence  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council.We express our solidarity with the struggle of the Timorese people  led by FRETILIN  for the attainment of their legitimate and inalienable rights.On the Korean peninsula  the People's Republic of Mozambique supports the initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a peaceful reunification of that nation.We encourage the Secretary-General to pursue his efforts aimed at finding a just and lasting solution to the question of Afghanistan.One can consider positive the results reached in the negotiations between Indonesia and Viet Nam on the issue of Kampuchea. My country is following developments in Latin America with attention and concern. We express our solidarity with the people of Nicaragua in their struggle in defence of their national sovereignty  territorial integrity and peace. We pay a tribute to their repeated readiness to find a negotiated settlement of the conflict affecting Central America. We are in solidarity with the struggle of the people of El Salvador for the triumph of democracy in their country. The efforts made in that region to resolve current conflicts by means of negotiations - and particularly the Agreement reached by the Central American countries in Guatemala - offer hopeful prospects for the restoration of peace in the region. №e People's Republic of Mozambique supports these initiatives and hopes that the international community will do likewise.In the South Atlantic  we favour a negotiated solution to the question of the Malvinas. The good offices of our Secretary-General can play an important role in this question.Turning now to the Indian Ocean  of particular interest to my country are the efforts being made to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  free of nuclear weapons.In this context  we urge all Member States to co-operate with the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  so that it can successfully complete its work and fulfil its mandate without further delay  and pave the way for the early convening of the international Conference on the Indian Ocean. It is with anguish that all humankind notes that the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction at current levels entails in itself the danger of destroying the life of our planet. It is essential not only to halt the development of these means of mass destruction but also to ensure their limitation and complete elimination.The People's Republic of Mozambique regards as highly significant the talks between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with a view to reaching agreements on the limitation and elimination of nuclear weapons and other arms of mass destruction.We welcome the result already achieved on medium-range missiles. This is a significant step towards general and complete disarmament. We hope that the commendable efforts made and the flexibility demonstrated by the two parties will continue. We look forward to seeing the redoubling of the political will of all those whose contribution is relevant to the success of this endeavour. Detente between the nuclear Powers will decrease tension and the tendency to create zones of influence detrimental to the interests of the world community as a whole. The reduction of arms will release resources that must be used to the benefit of the harmonious development of nations  particularly developing countries.The Mozambican people are steadfast and determined. We love freedom and we prize independence. Now  as in the past  we are making huge sacrifices to preserve our freedom and independence.Today  when we take up arms  we do it solely in defence of a nation that is ours  in defence of a freedom that was achieved through a hard-fought struggle. We do it in defence of the interests of our people  of the objectives of our non-aligned State  of our ideals of liberty  peace and social progress. The solidarity we enjoy is evidence that the international community understands that this is the guiding force of our people and the main aim of our State.In saluting the international community  governments  international institutions - the United Nations specialized agencies in particular - and non-governmental and humanitarian bodies for the assistance rendered to our country  we urge them to continue and increase their support so that our people may defend themselves more effectively from the aggression to which they have been subjected.In concluding  I want to reiterate our adherence to the principles of the United Nations. We reaffirm our determination to co-operate with the United Nations system and all countries in the realization of the objectives of this great world Organization  namely  the elimination of focal points of tension  the containment and elimination of conflicts; the establishment of a just international economic order  disarmament  the elimination of wars  small or big  local or world-wide  and the preservation of peace and security. Our active non-alignment is the foundation of the strengthening of our friendship and co-operation with all nations regardless of the economic and ideological systems they embrace. We are always ready to co-operate with all those that respect our independence and those that wish to work with us on the basis of mutual respect and all the universal principles of the United Nations.I am confident that representatives will faithfully convey to their peoples and Governments this message of co-operation  friendship and peace. The struggle continues."
"97",4849,"MRT",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the Mauritanian delegation  Sir  may I first congratulate you on your well-deserved election to the presidency or the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Your moral and intellectual qualities and the wise  constructive positions taken by your country are assurances of the smooth functioning of the work of the session. We also congratulate your predecessor  the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  on the outstanding way he presided over the work of the forty-first session  and Ambassador Reed of the United States of America on his appointment to his lofty office.I also express to the Secretary-General once again out country's respect and confidence in him and I thank him for the effective  far-sighted way in which he performs the task entrusted to him. We also welcome his efforts to promote international peace and security.	.A rapid survey of the international situation makes clear the scale of the dangers threatening the future of mankind. The economic crisis continues to worsen and its effects are being felt more severely each day. The North-South dialogue  on which such great hopes were placed  is  and may continue to be  stalemated. World growth is below the level recorded in the 1960  which suggests there are several years of recession ahead for our economies.The gap continues to widen between the developed and developing nations. The per capita income of the developing countries fell by 4 per cent at the very time when a 3.5 per cent increase was recorded by the industrialized nations. The conjuncture of deteriorating terms of trade  the debt burden  protectionism and the acute instability of financial markets explains this alarming trend.The deterioration in terms of trade reached new heights in 1986 with the fall of commodity prices to their lowest level since the Second World War. At the same time  the price of manufactures continued to rise  wiping out the results of efforts to redress the balances of payment of the developing countries.The strengthening of protectionism in the developed countries  the weakness of commodity markets and the meagre South-South trade are throttling our young industries. Lastly  the scale of debt and above all the scale of debt servicing have resulted in a veritable financial haemorrhage for our economies and have seriously undermined our export earnings  already weakened by the deterioration in the terms of trade.The consequences of these factors for the economies of the developing countries have been disastrous. Unemployment  hunger  disease  illiteracy and social crises are becoming widespread. Several development projects and social programmes have been rendered impossible  and everything suggests that this tendency will continue in future. This situation cannot but be a cause of concern to the whole international community  since no one can live in isolation and it is unthinkable for a minority to continue to live in opulence while the overwhelming majority of the peoples of the world have intolerable standards of living.We are duty bound to become involved in a process that can overcome the present crisis. This process should begin with global negotiations  characterized this time by the determination to achieve concrete results. The short-term objective must be to take immediate steps to believe the suffering of the peoples of the third world  and  over the long-term  the objective must be to make deep-seated reforms in the international economic system in order to establish a just and equitable new order. That is the path of salvation  prosperity and peace  and no one is entitled to stray from it.This economic situation has seriously afflicted Africa  which alone has to bear one fifth of the debt burden of the third world. We continue to place our hopes in the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  and we whole-heartedly desire a special conference on the African debt to be convened.One of the scourges threatening our continent is drought and desertification  which persist despite a slight improvement in rainfall. According to forecasts by specialists  the forests of Mauritania  for example  could disappear in a few years if there is not a marked improvement in climatic conditions. Mauritania has joined with other States of the Sahel  within the context of regional organizations  to combat that threat and promote the economic and social well being of the peoples of the region. Nationally  a vast programme of economic recovery and growth has been in effect since 1985 and tangible results - such as a substantial reduction in the budget deficit - can already be seen.The rural sector occupies pride of place in this programme. The long-term objective is to achieve food self-sufficiency  in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development.At present we are receiving significant food assistance  and we take this opportunity sincerely to thank friendly countries and United Nations agencies for this generous aid. Unfortunately  everything suggests that for several years to come we shall continue to have to appeal to them  but we are already beginning to earmark this assistance for production.Our policy of ""Food for Work"" and the assistance rendered by the Common Counterpart Fund for Food Aid are intended to encourage and stimulate activities for community development. The donors are fully involved in the distribution and management of food assistance. That testifies to our determination to work in an open and businesslike way.Our National Government  led by Colonel Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya  President of the Military Committee for National Salvation and Head of State  is convinced that the battle for development requires the mobilization of all our energies and the establishment in the country of a climate of confidence. That conviction prompted the decision taken on the morrow of the restructuring of 12 December 1984 to declare a general amnesty for political detainees and to restore all individual and collective freedoms to citizens.	·The participation of the citizens in the management of their own affairs became a reality with the organization in December 1986 of free and democratic elections in the municipalities - the first in the history of our country. The elections took place in complete freedom  with many candidates and without any trace of pressure. Our citizens will soon vote in all the departments  in the same conditions  to choose their local representatives.Mauritania is experiencing a climate of unprecedented freedom. The rights of the citizens are respected and protected  and  internationally  this policy has been crowned by the ratification of several international instruments relating to human rights.Another  no less important  dimension of our policy is the fight against illiteracy  the clarion call for which was given in the historic appeal of 20 January 1986 by the Head of State himself. The objective is to eliminate illiteracy by the 199ÛS and to make all citizens aware of the stakes  challenges and realities of our age.Mauritanian women are playing an increasingly important role in various sectors of national life. Educating them is a particular concern of the public authorities. The programmes against illiteracy are particularly directed to women  and their full involvement has become a fact with the attainment by several women of senior posts in the Government.The international political situation is still characterized by instability and the persistence of flashpoints of tension throughout the world. In the Middle East  .Israel continues to carry out a policy of constant aggression and systematic occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories. It is frantically undertaking changes in the physical and demographic character of those territories  with a view to their final annexation. This policy of fait accompli  expansion and aggression maintains a climate of violence and instability  and it endangers international peace and security.The question of Palestine is the core of the Middle East conflict  and there can be no just and lasting peace in the region without total and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from the Palestinian and other occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of El-Qods  and recognition of the territorial and national identity of the Palestinian people by means of the free exercise of its right to self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign state in its homeland  under the leadership of its authentic  legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).	.In that context  the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations  with the full participation of the PLO on a footing of equality with all the other parties  would be an important step  and Mauritania welcomes the efforts deployed towards that end this year.In southern Africa  the apartheid regime  an ally and partner of the Zionist entity  is pursuing with equal zealousness a hateful racist  repressive and expansionist policy against the peoples of South Africa  Namibia and the front-line States.Within the borders of the Republic of South Africa  the Pretoria regime is taking an increasingly hard stand  demonstrating that the so-called constitutional reforms were a mere farce. Mauritania rejects Pretoria's racial policy and reaffirm its support for the heroic  just struggle led by the African National Congress. In Namibia  the Pretoria regime is pursuing its policy of occupation and repression and systematically violating the relevant United Nations resolutions  particularly resolution 435 (1978)  adopted unanimously by the Security Council.That resolution remains the sole acceptable basis for a just and lasting settlement of the question of Namibia. Pretoria's aggressive policy is directed against all the States in the region and indiscriminately harms civilians and the vital economic facilities of those States. The regime's constant use of force  in defiance of international law  is a challenge to our Organization and to the entire international community.Mauritania remains convinced that no just and lasting solution to the problems of southern Africa can be achieved without the total elimination of the policy of apartheid  the establishment of a democratic  egalitarian regime in South Africa and the complete independence of Namibia.In the Gulf  the deadly war between two neighbours that are Members of the United Nations continues. It effects every country of that vital region of the world and is a dangerous threat to international peace and security. Mauritania is deeply devoted to agreement among Islamic nations and desires the security and stability of the Gulf countries. For seven years  therefore  it has been calling for an end to that war by peaceful means. The United Nations  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and other bodies with the same good will have taken initiatives to that end. Today we are witnessing the danger of an extension of the conflict  with threats to freedom of navigation in the Gulf; hence it is vital that the international community do its utmost to implement as soon as possible Security Council resolution 598 (1987). In this regard we pay tribute to Iraq's openness to all the peace initiatives  particularly Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  and hope that Iran will follow the same course.	 With regard to the question of Afghanistan  Mauritania remains convinced that only a political solution based on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country and respect for its independence and sovereignty - thus opening the way to national reconciliation and the establishment of an independent and neutral national government - can restore peace to that struggling brother people.As regards Kampuchea  Mauritania reiterates its support for the resolutions of the Assembly on the question  and reaffirms the need for foreign troops to be withdrawn from Kampuchea so that the Khmer people may freely decide their own future.With regard to the situation in Central America  Mauritania commends the efforts of the Contadora Group and its Support Groups to promote peace and stability in that sensitive region  and hopes that their efforts will be crowned with success.I return to the African continent and the fratricidal conflict between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Chad. We ardently hope that the ad hoc committee of Heads of state set up by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to find a final solution to the conflict will be successful.On our immediate borders  the problem of Western Sahara continues to be one of our major concerns. With its many close links to the parties to the conflict  Mauritania considers that there can be no just and lasting solution without a shared desire for understanding and dialogue. Therefore  we support the commendable efforts being made  particularly by the United Nations and the OAU  to find a solution to the conflict.Peoples of our region yearn for such a solution  which will allow the freeing of all the potential that exists for the construction of the great Arab Maghreb. Mauritania will firmly resist any attempt to involve it in that fratricidal war  and will maintain its policy of strict neutrality. My Government will continue to do its utmost for the restoration of peace and harmony in our region and for the building of a united and prosperous Maghreb.The conflicts to which I have referred are taking up nearly all the resources of many developing countries  preventing them from devoting those resources to the well-being of their peoples.Astronomical sums are devoted each year to the design  production  development and stockpiling of weapons  at a time when more than two thirds of mankind cannot meet their basic needs. That is a challenge to morality  common sense and logic. It is terrible to have to say that never has mankind been so close to self-destruction  in a century in which man has discovered the secret of the atom  conquered space and acquired considerable socio-political rights.It is scandalous that despite our great scientific knowledge and technology and the enormous social and political progress that has been made  we cannot even guarantee the perpetuation of the human race  the fruit of the suffering  sacrifices and laborious efforts of past generations  which lived in a much more difficult environment.General and complete disarmament  a fundamental goal of our Organization  unfortunately appears as remote as it is crucial. My country devoutly hopes that the efforts both within the United Nations and outside will contribute as soon as possible to the realization of that goal  and thus remove mankind from the scourge of war and at the same time release part of the enormous resources currently devoted to the arms race to economic and social development.The growing impoverishment of the overwhelming majority of mankind and the imbalance in international economic relations  the persistence of armed conflicts and the arms race are challenges to our Organization  which is called upon to bring about a world of peace and international solidarity and ensure economic  social and cultural progress for all peoples. History will judge our Organization on the extent to which it realizes the principles and purposes of the Charter.In that regard  the Member States - especially the great Powers - have particular responsibilities; they have the duty to do everything possible to ensure the success of the noble and universal mission of this indispensable instrument of international peace and co-operation. Therefore  their words and their deeds  their principles and their purposes  should flow from their adherence to the Charter.The complexity  universality and seriousness of current problems relating to peace and the world economy make multilateralism indispensable. Its strengthening demands the renunciation of all kinds of selfishness and compliance with the requirements of our age - the sovereign equality of States  democracy in international relations and the establishment of a just and equitable economic system.My country is aware of the institutional weaknesses and imperfections of the United Nations  but it also fully appreciates its important successes in such diverse fields as the economic  social and cultural  decolonization  peace  education  health and other related specialized areas. Mauritania reiterates its firm attachment to the noble ideals of the Charter and its faith in the need to develop friendly relations between States  achieve international co-operation based on mutual respect and advantage and preserve the United Nations as an instrument for harmonizing the efforts of nations to achieve those common goals.That devotion to international co-operation  peace and the peaceful settlement of disputes results from the nature and history of my country. At the hinge between Africa and the Arab world  Mauritania is a land where cultures and civilizations meet. Its geographical position makes it the pivot for understanding and co-operation between those two nearby  complementary regions. That role dates back several centuries  to the time when our Mahadras welcomed students from all the regions of Africa and our scholars went to teach in the great Arab universities. Moreover  our land was  and still is  a crossroads and a trading centre.Our devotion to peace also derives from our roots in Africa  where persuasion and debate are the usual course of conduct  and from the teachings of our holy religion  Islam  which makes understanding  assistance to others and tolerance a religious duty. Those principles recur as a leitmotiv in the Koran and the Sunna. Thus Allah  the All-Powerful  tells us in the Holy Book:""Help ye one another in righteousness and piety.But help ye not one another in sin and rancour."" (The Holy Koran  v: 3)"
"98",4895,"MUS",42,1987,"﻿It is a privilege and a great honour for me to address such a distinguished gathering. May I take this opportunity to congratulate most warmly Mr. Peter Florin on his unanimous election to the presidency  a fitting tribute to his personal qualities and to his country. My delegation has no doubt that with the benefit of his extensive diplomatic skills and vast political experience our deliberations will take place in a spirit of understanding and friendship.I wish also to extend my congratulations to his predecessor  Mr. Choudhury  for the skills and finesse with which he conducted the last session. We are grateful to him for his valuable contribution to the resolution of critical issues  so vital to the survival of the United Nations  which is the repository of the hopes and aspirations of mankind.I wish also to place on record our deep appreciation of the dedicated work of Mr. Perez de Cuellar in pursuance of the goals set by the Charter of the Organization. Thanks to his vision and statesmanship  the United Nations has played a key role in the maintenance of stability and world peace. The tasks ahead of the Organization remain as complex as ever. Although it has been said time and again that the United Nations has no teeth  yet the decisions taken by the Assembly have without doubt influenced the march of events. That goes to show that United Nations resolutions still matter  although more often than not only as a moral coercive force.Disarmament  and especially nuclear disarmament  is one of the major problems of our time. Should this vital problem not be resolved in the minimum lapse of time we face the prospect of mass destruction and annihilation. It is to this task  in my opinion  that we should address ourselves with all our energy and courage. It must be obvious that massive and sophisticated weaponry can be no guarantee of world peace. The alternative is too horrible to contemplate. I am confident that we are level-headed enough to promote collective security arrangements in the name of future  unborn generations. The positive contribution of the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations cannot be denied and it is my view that every effort should be made to strengthen those forces for the sake of stability in world affairs. Sanity dictates that course of action.We have on many previous occasions spoken on the tremendous amount of resources and human ingenuity devoted to devising more and more elaborate and efficient instruments of death. Global arms expenditure is now close to $US 1 trillion annually - that is nearly $US 200 a year for every individual on earth today. The per capita gross national product figures of several of the least developed countries do not even match that figure  while other developing countries are hardly better off. This stark contrast must surely constitute one of the most profound paradoxes of our time. The adoption of the Final Document by the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development is an important step by the international community towards rectifying this anomaly. While we regret the lack of concrete financial commitments  we fully endorse all the measures contained in the action programme of the draft final document of the Conference and appeal to all Member States  particularly the major producers of arms  to implement them fully. Only a temporary and uneasy peace can be achieved through armaments; lasting peace is more likely to be established through economic development and the sharing of wealth and resources on an equitable basis.I feel it is my duty to refer again to the abhorrent system of apartheid in South Africa. The consensus is now universal that the system of apartheid as it stands today cannot be reformed; indeed  there is a growing awareness that the system should be dismantled. Mere moral exhortations or attempts at coaxing Pretoria into a genuine change of heart have failed so far to bring about any significant change. All the half-hearted pressures that have been applied by those who possess the economic leverage to have an effective influence on the South African regime have not had the desired effects. We therefore wish to reiterate the numerous declarations adopted at several international meetings and conferences to the effect that the Security Council should impose measures for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.Pretoria still continues to stall and manoeuvre against the process of the emancipation of Namibia. Practically all the conditions required for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) have now been fulfilled  yet Pretoria  in its obstinacy in perpetuating its Illegal occupation  continues to hold the freedom of the Namibian people hostage to the resolution of completely extraneous issues.Once again we are concerned that preparatory work for the conference on the Indian Ocean is still far from being completed. In fact the report of the Ad hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean seems to suggest that the holding of the conference could be postponed indefinitely. In the meantime the militarization of the region continues to be built up  thus increasing the peril to world security.It is deplorable that there appears to be a definite lack of collective will and effort to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  yet the necessity for such a move is more than obvious. It is our view that only the full and active participation of all the permanent members of the Security Council and the users of the sea lanes for either trade or communications will ensure the convening of the conference  which is long overdue.I should like to remind this Assembly in this connection that the Chagos archipelago  which belonged to Mauritius  was excised from our territory before we obtained independence  in clear violation of the principles of the United Nations. Its inhabitants were coerced into permanent exile to clear the way for a military base in Diego Garcia. The key strategic role now assumed by Diego Garcia has brought the nuclear peril right into the heart of the Indian Ocean region. The loss of Chagos has also meant the denial to the Mauritian people of access to the significant ocean resources around the archipelago. We renew our demand for the rightful restitution of the Chagos archipelago to the national heritage of Mauritius. We are grateful to the States members of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  as well as to other friendly countries  for their strong and consistent support of our just claim. The Iran-Iraq war now poses a new level of threat to peace in that region drawing to the recent entry into the Persian Gulf of military units belonging to several major Powers. This endless war has already had appalling consequences in terms of material and human losses  and the tally continues to rise on both sides. In a very rare and welcome show of unanimity. Security Council members recently adopted a resolution demanding the immediate cessation of hostilities. We appeal to both belligerents  with whom we are on friendly terms  to abide by the resolution's provisions as a first step towards a just solution of the conflict. The consequences of an escalation of the war and possible chain reactions at the regional and international levels have become so unpredictable in the face of the awesome display of foreign military forces in the Gulf that it would be horrifying as either side to raise the stakes.As we near the end of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless  we fish to highlight the special plight of those who are not only homeless but have also been driven from their own lands by foreign military occupation - the Palestinians  Kampucheans and Afghans  among others  who must wait for peace before :heir double objective can be attained.All foreign intervention and military occupation must be brought to an end in Afghanistan and Kampuchea and their non-aligned status restored without further delay. For too many years  the incessant flow of refugees from those two countries has created tension and security problems in neighbouring States. Far too often in modern times  liberation has been used as an excuse to deny some people their inherent right to self-determination.As has been stated here and in numerous other forums  by nearly the whole international community  the Palestinian problem is the central issue in the Middle East situation. There appears to be some indication that the idea of an international conference on the Middle East has recently gained ground. Such a conference  as we have often repeated in the past  must include the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization. To be lasting  any settlement must include the full restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.For the first time in more than 150 years  the peoples of Central America were recently able to meet and discuss their common problems and succeed in achieving an agreement that has been welcomed overwhelmingly by the international community. That success of regional concertation must be given every chance to be implemented  and we sincerely hope that no extraneous constraints or pressures will be brought to bear on that indigenous Central American peace process.It is heartening to note that a peace settlement has recently been achieved in Sri Lanka  a country that has known war and strife for many months. In this connection  I must particularly praise the role played by both the Indian and the Sri Lankan leaders and the display of statesmanlike qualities and spirit of compromise and conciliation so readily shown by the two sides.We in Mauritius have always been proud o£ our record of living peacefully among groups of people of various ethnic origins  and we welcome the peace settlement in Sri Lanka as it reinforces our own conviction that people of diverse origin can successfully build up a peaceful and harmonious nation.In regard to Korea  the Korean people have now waited almost 40 years for the peaceful reunification of their country. Hostile diatribes must give way to confidence-building measures. We have no doubt that all the people of Korea  both of the North and of the South  will eventually join the rest of the international community in the United Nations.The world economy appears to be continuing its sluggish course  as some of the major industrialized countries still seem reluctant to stimulate their economies and generate demand and production. World trade has followed the same trend. It increased in volume by only 5 per cent last year  and by only 3.2 percent in 1985. Primary commodity prices have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly 50 years  and the majority of developing countries  which depend on trade of primary products for most of their export earnings  have seen a 30-per-cent decline in their terms of trade with developed countries. Protectionist measures by large developed countries have further compromised the creation of a more favourable environment for accelerated growth in international trade.The recent adoption by consensus of the Final Act of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) represents a timely and essential contribution to the prospects of multilateral co-operation for resolving some of the aforementioned problems. It is noteworthy that this document spelled out the respective responsibilities of both the developing and the developed countries in this tremendous task  particularly with respect to the debt crisis.The results of that conference  which followed closely the overall positive outcome of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the African economic crisis  thus reaffirm the spirit of equal partnership which should prevail between developed and developing countries in multilateral co-operation activities. Together  those two meetings represent a welcome and significant boost to the revival of the North-South dialogue.Although it may be premature at the present time to offer a meaningful assessment of the progress made in implementing the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery  it nevertheless appears that the pace and magnitude of the flow of resources required have fallen short of expectations thus far. Measures for clearing the books on official debts  for example  especially in the case of the poorest sub-Saharan countries  should be more comprehensive than is such measures  and other debt-relief plans  including more lending from banks  are among the key components of the international support action required to establish sufficient financial flows to reverse the negative trend in development of several African countries. And as UNCTAD VII has emphasized  action by developed countries on commodities and international trade is urgently required. Such action will assist African countries that are highly dependent on earnings from the export of primary products in restructuring their economies and honouring their debt obligations.He in the developing world very much hope that a more favourable climate will be created to help alleviate the untold difficulties besetting us. In this connection  we appeal for improved trading opportunities with the industrialized countries for primary commodities and textile and other manufactured goods. Such action would help us to sustain the export diversification policies we are pursuing. While many developing countries are under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMP) to liberalize their exchange and trade systems at high political and social costs  industrialized countries are resorting to trade restrictions and subsidies in various guises. But we are encouraged by the glimmer of hope provided recently as the IMF and World Bank annual meetings ended with promises by some industrialized countries to take a more active role in reshaping the world economy.Every year as we gather here and debate repeatedly the numerous protracted issues that still elude solution within the framework of the United Nations  we should also remind ourselves of the equally numerous problems  especially in the economic and social fields  that the Organization is continuously dealing with much more successfully.The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  held in Vienna earlier this year  constitutes perhaps the most important milestone yet in the concerted action by all Governments against this scourge. Until then  international co-operation in the war on drugs had been less effective as consumer and supplier countries shifted the main responsibilities for drug abuse control on one another. We are therefore grateful to the Secretary-General for his timely initiative to put an end to this sterile debate.Among the measures for fighting against drug abuse and illicit trafficking  we wish to emphasize those which would improve exchange of information on narcotic trafficking  improve and harmonize extradition treaties and facilitate the disclosure  forfeiture and seizure of assets obtained from trafficking.As we have often affirmed in the past  the smaller and weaker members of the international community have no other alternative than to turn to the United Nations in times of crisis. We are therefore very much concerned every time the principle of multilateralism becomes the object of assault by those who perhaps harbour nostalgia for earlier times when only a handful of nations controlled the fate of the world. The present financial straits of the Organization are the result of such attacks. But in the end  even those who are among the fiercest critics of the United Nations have occasionally to resort to this forum to draw international support for their own policies. We must therefore never fail to reaffirm our faith in the principles of the Charter and continue to strengthen its provisions on international peace and security.May I conclude by reasserting that the United Nations is a vital forum for airing differences among nations of the world. It is a means of dialogue and communication and the surest safety-valve in a turbulent world."
"99",4932,"MWI",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the Malawi delegation I should like to join those who have spoken before me in congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. The wealth of experience and knowledge of international affairs as well as the diplomatic skills and patience which you bring with you to this lofty seat are well known. We are certain  therefore  that under your guidance the General Assembly will achieve positive results. In wishing you success in carrying out your duties and responsibilities  I assure you of my delegation's full co-operation at all times.My delegation equally wishes to express appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Choudhury  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  for the remarkable way in which he presided over the forty-first session. Under his stewardship  many important and historic decisions were made by the General Assembly.We wish also to express our great pleasure at the good work undertaken by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  during the past 12 months  particularly that of mediation between parties in conflict.The Malawi delegation wishes to congratulate Mr. Joseph Reed on his appointment to the post of Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs.While the situation as regards international peace and security continues to cause much concern  we have been encouraged by some positive developments in the past few months. We welcomed the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which was sponsored by the United Nations and held here in August and September. We welcomed the adoption by consensus of the final document of the Conference. We believe that the document has provided a basis on which to build further towards the achievement of disarmament and therefore the promotion of development around the world. Malawi has also been encouraged by indications of progress at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  particularly with regard to the question of chemical weapons.My delegation joins others in welcoming the announcement that the two super-Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  have reached an agreement in principle on an accord on the elimination of intermediate nuclear forces. We note that this will be the first such accord ever and therefore represents a major step forward in the field of nuclear-weapons disarmament.My delegation wishes to congratulate the two sides on this historic development. In so doing  it is our hope that the accord  which we understand could be signed soon  will give a much needed impetus to efforts also to attain disarmament in conventional weapons. For  in the end  international peace and security will best be assured only by complete and comprehensive disarmament.The elimination of or reduction in arms production and arms stockpiling cannot by themselves guarantee international security. For international security depends as much on the conscious promotion of peace as it does on the absence of the tools of war. There is  therefore  an equally urgent need to find ways to bring to an end the areas of conflict and tension that exist in the various regions of the world. In all of these we can clearly see that the main causes are either the denial to peoples of their right to self-determination or the deliberate disregard by some States of the sovereignty and integrity of other States.In the early months of this year  our interest was aroused by sudden developments that seemed to promise positive movement towards breakthroughs on the respective questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. Sadly  however  neither the much-heralded reforms and other initiatives announced by the authorities in Kabul in January  nor the flurry of diplomatic activity in Viet Nam a few weeks later would appear to have led to any changes. If anything significant came out of these developments it was perhaps a reaffirmation of what has been repeatedly stated in this Assembly; that only the withdrawal of foreign forces will facilitate a meaningful solution to the two respective questions. The peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea must be left to resolve their political differences and determine their political future by themselves.Another area of concern in the Far East is the Korean peninsula. My Government remains convinced that the political future of that area can best be determined by the Korean people themselves  through genuine dialogue and negotiations between the Governments of North Korea and South Korea. That is why Malawi supports the recent call by South Korea for talks  without pre-condition  at a higher political level than has been the case in the past. It is our hope that all sides will give the call by South Korea serious consideration.In discussing a region which seems beset by seemingly intractable problems  it is a welcome change to be able to applaud something truly and significantly positive. We refer here to the accord signed in July by the Governments of India and Sri Lanka in order to bring about an end to the conflict in northern Sri Lanka which had threatened permanently to divide the Sri Lankan people while at the same time promoting tension between the neighbouring States of Sri Lanka and India. In this regard  we salute the two leaders. President Jayewardene of Sri Lanka and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India  for their singular act of courage and faith. We see the accord as a concrete example of how States can co-operate to promote international peace and security.As we review the situation in the region of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf  we find cause for grave concern in both the apparent widening of the conflict and the threat inherent therein to international peace and security. We have noted with interest the adoption on 20 July 1987 by the Security Council of  resolution 598 (1987)  which appears to us to be a reasonable basis for finding a lasting solution to the conflict in the Gulf.With regard to the Middle East  we in Malawi have been encouraged by the growing support for a proposal which was made to the General Assembly last year for the convening of an international peace conference  sponsored by the United Nations  to be attended by all parties directly concerned in the conflict. War has not been able to end the conflict between the Arab States and Israel  because war cannot address the crucial issue  the right of all the peoples of the region to self-determination within recognized and secure borders. We have stated before that only through dialogue among all parties to the conflict can the framework for a lasting solution that meets the needs and aspirations of all concerned be found. We believe that the time is now right for such dialogue  and we believe it is right and proper that the United Nations should have a central role in facilitating such dialogue. We support the proposal for an international conference on the Middle East  My delegation notes with encouragement the return to peace in the Mediterranean region following the sudden heightening of tension there in early 1986. However  while we delight in this  we regret that peace and national conciliation in Cyprus continues to elude the people of that island State  We support the efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at keeping open the channels of communication between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. We regret  however  that those efforts have so far not met with success. We therefore appeal to all those concerned in this matter to co-operate with the Secretary-General and accept the need to resume the intercommunal talks as a way towards finding a formula for the lasting solution the foreign invasion of 1974 was unable to provide.Malawi welcomes the peace plan recently proposed by the leaders of the Central American region with a view to bringing about an end to the various conflicts and tensions in that region. We should like to register our support for their bold initiatives  and we wish them success in this endeavour.On our own continent of Africa too  tension and conflict  particularly in the southern African region  continue to pose a threat to international peace and security. There are three main causes of that situation: first  the continued denial to the people of Namibia of their right to independence and self-determination·  secondly  the attempts by some external forces to impose upon certain countries of the region the types of ideology and forms of government preferred by those forces  in complete disregard of the choices of the citizens of those countries; and thirdly  the problem of apartheid  a political system which the African people and the entire world have unequivocally and unanimously condemned and rejected.With regard to Namibia  we reiterate what we have said before: that the independence of Namibia is long overdue. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) met all the legitimate concerns of all the parties to the political dispute over Namibia  and all the parties accepted  and still accept  that resolution as the basis for the granting of independence. We can therefore see no justification for the continuing delay in its implementation. Indeed  the delay is contributing to the growing toll in lives and to the hardships imposed upon the people in that Territory.The Malawi delegation has stated many times in the past that force and violence are not  and cannot be  the way to resolve political problems or any other differences. Force can at best provide only temporary solutions. We remain convinced that only through contact and dialogue can lasting solutions be found. That is why the Malawi Government welcomed the recent courageous initiative by some political leaders in South Africa in starting a dialogue with the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  particularly in Senegal recently. We are convinced that this development can only be for the good of all South Africans  black and white  and we hope it will lead to more and more contacts and wider dialogue including not only the white liberals  on the one hand  and the ANC  on the other  but eventually also other white leaders - even Government leaders — and other representatives of the black majority  such as the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC).We have followed with interest the initiatives and programmes undertaken by the United Nations during the past year in the area of social development. Among these  perhaps the major one was the United Nations-sponsored International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  held in Vienna in May. The threat drug abuse poses to our future generations and the social problems it presents  particularly for developing countries  have been analysed. It has also been known for some time that combating the production and abuse of and illicit trafficking in drugs requires wide co-operation and concerted action by the world's Governments. Yet it somehow appeared that  except at the professional level  co-operation was never going to be achieved. While the political leaders of some countries saw the need for the problems of drug production  trafficking and abuse to be addressed at the political level  many others did not yet recognize the magnitude and urgency of the problem.At a time when greater attention was suddenly being given to these issues and more countries were beginning to realize the need for co-operation  the convening of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking was most timely. We believe it provided an excellent opportunity to bring about a greater understanding of the problem. It provided an opportunity also for those who had already acquired considerable experience in dealing with the problem to share that experience with those who are new to the problem  and for all countries to come up with a strategy for international co-operation. Malawi was represented at the Vienna International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking by a three-member delegation. We believe the Conference was a success  and we hope the decisions and plans of action adopted in Vienna will be faithfully implemented. We certainly hope too that a review conference will be held at the appropriate time to examine how successful - or unsuccessful - we have been in achieving the goals enunciated at the Vienna Conference.It is Malawi's hope that  in the light of experience gained with regard to drug abuse  consideration will be given to a similar initiative concerning what is clearly emerging as the single most widespread problem with dire implications for the future. We refer here to the killer epidemic of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). We are pleased to note that the World Health organization (WHO) has already begun to devote its attention to the AIDS problem. We hope that from the lesson learned with regard to that drug problem it will be considered that the early convening of an international conference devoted to the question of AIDS would be most beneficial.Meanwhile we would also like to express our appreciation for the decision by the United Nations to give special attention to the population problems in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this context we welcome the Strategy for United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa  which was adopted by the United Nations Development Programme (ÜNDP) Governing Council at its thirty-fourth session last June. We are of the view that the Programme of Action envisaged in the Strategy will contribute greatly to the efforts of the Governments in the region as they seek to attain an equitable balance between the social and economic development needs of their national populations  on the one hand  and the resources available to their Governments to meet those needs  on the other.However  this plan cannot be realized without the UNFPA itself having sufficient financial resources to carry out its programmes. We sincerely hope that Member states will join hands in assuring the UNFPA's financial health and that those who are in a position to do so will consider the possibility of making additional voluntary contributions.In the area of economic co-operation between the rich North and the poor South there appears to be issues which require urgent attention if the serious poverty of the South is to be halted. These issues are  first  greater access for products from the developing South to the markets of the industrialized North; secondly  higher and more lucrative prices for the goods exported from the South in relation to products manufactured and exported by the North; thirdly  a halt in the reverse flow of funds from the developing to the developed countries caused basically by  fourthly  the repayment of debt to lenders in the North. Naturally we see these matters as being interrelated.Despite the assurances of the industrialized countries to the contrary  we have seen an increase in recent years in both tariff and non-tariff barriers against the exports of developing countries. At the same time  there has been a steady decline in the prices of commodities - most of which are primary goods - from the South while those of manufactures from the North have continued to rise. This is a question of terms of trade. And faced with declining export earnings and soaring import bills  developing countries have been forced to borrow ever more at high interest rates from the same countries of the North in order to sustain their economies. Now  many developing countries nave frightfully large fractions of their national incomes committed to debt repayment. Herein lies the problem - a source of international dissension.We are glad that at the meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) agreement was reached on the need for greater economic assistance to the least-developed countries. The undertaking by the developed countries to encourage lending institutions in their areas to consider being more flexible in order to ease the debt burden of developing countries is also appreciated. However  it is my delegation's hope that greater practical efforts will be made towards helping the export commodities from the poor South to be more lucrative. In this way the debt problem begins to be alleviated. Naturally the developing South would have to follow sensible and workable economic policies  which appears to be what they are doing now.In this regard it is also important for my delegation to acknowledge the crucial role played by all the United Nations agencies  in particular the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)   in our development efforts  in addition to that played by other bilateral and multilateral donors  Economic Community under the Lomé Convention and also the World Bank  in addition we are pleased with the important assistance offered to Malawi by the African Development Bank (ADB). In our opinion the ADB is a very good institution through which the developed countries could increasingly channel funds for the continent's economic development; I am therefore making an appeal to them.Finally I should like to say that  in spite of all that has been said about the uncompleted work  unfulfilled promises and unresolved problems by the United Nations  many a speaker appears by implication and directly to support the continued existence of the Organization. Yes  we need the Organization.For its part Malawi will continue to give the United Nations its fullest support and will always be ready to make its contribution towards ensuring the Organization's continued existence.

"100",4978,"MYS",42,1987,"﻿I should like first to extend my sincere felicitations to Mr. Peter Florin on his unanimous election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. His outstanding ability and statesmanship will serve to guide our deliberations most efficiently and effectively. May I also record my delegation's appreciation of the successful and productive presidency of Mr. Humayun Choudhury  Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  at the forty-first session of the General Assembly.This annual assembly provides yet another occasion for Member States to focus attention on the challenges and opportunities confronting the international community  in the weeks ahead we shall deliberate on the many burning and pressing issues which make up the contemporary world - issues which demand the attention of our Organization  It is the fervent hope of my delegation that in the often frenzied atmosphere of speech-making and lobbying we shall not lose sight of the fact that the ever growing number of issues before this body demand solution. We are here because we believe in the role of the United Nations as the highest and broadest forum for deliberating upon the affairs of the international community  indeed upon the affairs of mankind  and for the construction of international peace and development.There can be no illusion about the fact that peace  freedom  social justice and economic progress and development are of fundamental importance to the United Nations. It is true that in many parts of the world confrontations still persist  controversial issues remain unresolved and suffering continues. It is true that the sovereignty of nations  small nations in particular  continues to be violated. It is equally true that a large part of mankind is living in poverty  in dire need of food  shelter  medical care and basic education. Hence  the Organization must not be regarded as the special preserve of some patties or be manipulated by others.Let me state categorically that Malaysia firmly believes in the United Nations and its efficacy in dealing with the expanding contemporary world. Despite the challenges that confront and threaten us  the world is a better place today than it would have been without the United Nations. Today mankind is able to anticipate the future with a degree of optimism.	  Malaysia has given substance to the belief that contemporary international problems should be resolved through the United Nations. In recent years  the international community has been alarmed by the dramatic rise and impact of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking on societies throughout the world. It was obvious that it was only through effective international action that the problem could be eradicated. For this reason  Malaysia strongly supported the initiative Secretary-General's initiative that led to the convening of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Vienna last June. Our commitment found expression in the fact that our Prime Minister  Dato Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad  presided over the Conference. We are pleased with the results of the Conference  which provided the political will and laid down the framework for combating the drug menace. We urge societies everywhere and at all levels to make every possible effort to put that framework and political will into effect.In Vienna  the Conference agreed to declare an International Day against Drug Abuse and requested the Assembly to choose an appropriate date. It seems to us that 26 June  the day the Conference adopted its Declaration  would be appropriate. It would remain us of our pledge to express the political will needed to sustain the fight against the drug menace. The Assembly must also  at this session  take practical measures for implementation of the guidelines contained in the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline (CMO). Increased contributions must be provided to enhance the effective work done by the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control. Particular benefits can be derived through the convening of drug-related international and regional seminars  training programmes and the vital exchanges of information. The Division of Narcotic Drugs can be made the central depository for all information on drug-related activities and methodologies and such information should made readily available to Member States. Similarly  we are concerned over developments in Antarctica and their impact on the interests and concerns of society as a whole. In our view  and in that of many like-minded countries  the Antarctic Treaty does not adequately address those interests and concerns. We have brought the issue before the United Nations  convinced that it is the right place for dealing with the matter in a constructive manner. We are not unaware of the fact that the existing Treaty does contain some provisions that are conducive to international co-operation and regional peace. We must be satisfied that the interests of mankind are not disregarded in those instances. Despite what has been said about our motives in bringing the matter before this body  I should like to state emphatically that it is still our hope that through dialogue and consultations with the parties to the Treaty we shall eventually succeed in arriving at a consensus for an Antarctic Treaty system that would be universally accepted as representing the interests of mankind. The United Nations must of course have a role to play in that exercise.Our Organization continues to be faced with many cases of failure to adhere to the basic principles of the Charter and to United Nations resolutions. In Kampuchea  Vietnamese forces continue to defy General Assembly resolutions calling for their withdrawal and for the restoration of the right of self-determination to the people of that country. As long as this defiance of United Nations resolutions persists the peace and stability of the region of South-East Asia will be threatened. In spite of the inherent threat posed by the occupation of Kampuchea by Viet Nam  the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have consistently encouraged a comprehensive and lasting political solution to the Kampuchean problem  in conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. In this respect  we are grateful that the Secretary-General and his Special Representative are taking an active interest in the matter.I am sure that it has not escaped the notice of most delegations that following recent developments there has been a flurry of notes circulated as United Nations documents. If  for some  the circulation of those notes has confused rather than clarified the Issue  we are not surprised. There has been no hesitation on the part of Viet Nam to confuse the international community. Viet Nam and all the parties concerned should persist in the search for a political solution. In this context  the recent initiative taken by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia is a step forward. The proposal is for a meeting of certain persons in their individual capacities with a view to effecting the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces  and for national reconciliation. This would help to bring about a lasting settlement.Let me state the basic issues again: first  Viet Nam usurped the sovereignty of a small neighbouring State·  secondly  with the help of 150 000 of its troops  Viet Nam installed a puppet regime whose legitimacy has been consistently rejected by the international community through successive resolutions of the United Nations. General Assembly and the survival of that regime continues to be dependent on the presence of Vietnamese forces; thirdly  successive United Nations resolutions have called for the withdrawal of those forces  the restoration of Kampuchean sovereignty  and a comprehensive and lasting political solution; and fourthly the Kampucheans have suffered needlessly for far too long. Masses of innocent people are displaced from their homes and forced to seek refuge and relief in Thailand.The ASEAN countries stand firmly behind the resolutions of the General Assembly  and we urge Viet Nam to enter into a genuine and constructive dialogue with the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea under the presidency of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Only on this basis  we feel  can a comprehensive and lasting political solution be reached in consonance with the Charter of the United Nations. There is the other question of refugees from Viet Nam itself. The ASEAN countries are still facing a continuing flow of refugees from Viet Nam as a result of Viet Nam's failure fully to implement an orderly departure programme. It is imperative that Viet Nam address this problem urgently.Afghanistan is another instance where the sovereignty of a small nation has been violated and trampled upon. We continue to follow with interest the mediation efforts conducted under the auspices of the Secretary-General's Special Representative  and remain concerned that while those efforts are going on Afghanistan continues to be ravaged by repression  resulting in the deaths of many Afghans  while millions more are forced to live as refugees. A political solution is contingent upon the early withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan  recognition of the right of the refugees to return to their homeland and the restoration of Afghanistan's sovereignty. We call on the Soviet Union to demonstrate the necessary good faith and flexibility so that the process initiated by the Secretary-General can be successfully concluded and there can be self-determination in Afghanistan.Some of the major threats to international peace and security  such as the situation in the Middle East  the question of Palestine and the apartheid policy of South Africa  have for a very long time remained resistant to solutions. These questions cannot be resolved as long as the major Powers  in particular  refuse to act decisively and in accordance with United Nations decisions.In the Middle East  Israel has not ceased its aggression against the Arab peoples; it has not given up the Arab territories that it occupies; nor has it accepted the reality of the Palestinian people as a nation or respected the inalienable rights of the Palestinians  which include the tight to their homeland. Israel has continued to pursue aggressive and expansionist policies  with total disregard of the norms of international conduct. Encouraged by the stand of certain Powers  Israel continues to choose the option of brute strength  military might and terrorism  while rejecting peaceful solutions. The attitude of Israel and its supporters has severely constrained the ability of the United Nations Ь act effectively. Malaysia cannot ignore the fact that these are severe transgressions of the Charter.Malaysia strongly supports the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East  with the participation of all parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  as the sole representative of the Palestinian people  in order to find a comprehensive solution to the problem. This just and reasonable approach has been supported consistently by the General Assembly.	 In southern Africa  despite the condemnation of virtually all the Member States of the United Nations  the racist minority regime of South Africa persists in its policy of apartheid. The time is long past for merely debating this issue. What is required now is decisive action against Pretoria in the form of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter. Some major nations with vested interests in South Africa remain opposed to mandatory sanctions on the ground that sanctions would be ineffective and create hardship for blame South Africans and the front-line States. We reject this argument because the same countries have not been loath to apply sanctions when it has suited the interests.In any case  if those countries are truly concerned about the repercussions of sanctions  there are practical measures which can be taken to alleviate the effects of sanctions for black South Africans and the front-line States. For instance  the Non-Aligned Movement has established a Fund for Southern Africa for this very purpose. We therefore urge the major Powers concerned to act decisively so that the evil system of apartheid may be terminated.It is also incumbent on the international community - in particular the permanent members of the Security Council - to restore the inalienable rights of the Namibian people  on the basis of Security Council resolution 43 5 (197 8) . We reject any linkage of the Namibia question to extraneous issues. In this connection  Malaysia reiterates its firm support for the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in its struggle for justice and freedom for the people of Namibia.If this Organization is to serve mankind effectively  Member States must able by the fundamental principles of the Charter. They have the obligation to have recourse to peaceful means for the settlement of disputes. Yet we are witness to the Iran-Iraq conflict  now in its eighth year. Thousands have been sacrificed j cities have been ravaged·  chemical weapons have been used·  and vast economic resources which could otherwise have been used for constructive purposes have been wasted. Whatever the final outcome of the conflict may be  it is clear that no side will emerge the victory both sides will inherit the destructive results of the war and the consequences of lost resources and lost opportunities.The world had hoped that with the unanimous adoption last July of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) some positive result would ensue for the termination of the conflict. Instead  what is occurring is a heightening of tension as the conflict escalates and the warships of several nations converge in the area. Each major actor appears to be putting conflicting national and strategic interests before the objectives of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). Yet we note the unanimity in the adoption of that resolution. Malaysia totally supports the Secretary-General's efforts to secure application of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and we appeal to the two belligerents to be responsive to him and to stop the carnage and insanity of the conflict Malaysia has consistently advocated the principle that regional countries have a primary duty in the resolution of regional problems through dialogue and consultation. We firmly believe in regionalism as a basis for developing strong neighbourly relations in the interest of peace and stability. That is the foundation of our co-operation in ASEAN  which has contributed to progress and a growing sense of confidence in the region. We believe that this confidence is crucial in our effort to address current challenges and in forging peace and stability in the area. ASEAN has recently commemorated its twentieth anniversary and is currently preparing for a third summit further to enhance co-operation between Member States and make the Association stronger in the coming decades. We are happy to note that a similar trend is emerging in Central America  where a peace plan was signed last August in Guatemala. That plan received the support of the Contadora and the Support Groups  I would like to express the hope that this trend will enable the peoples of Central America to attain justice  to defend their freedom and independence and to concentrate on development free from super-Power rivalries.In North-East Asia  Malaysia urges the resumption of bilateral dialogue between the Governments of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for normalization of relations which would reduce tension in the Korean peninsula. It is hoped that through earnest efforts common ground can be found. Malaysia stands ready to support initiatives of either patty that are directed to achieving enduring peace and security in that region.Malaysia hopes that the discussions between the various interested parties conducted through the auspices of the International Olympic Council will bring about positive results and help pave the way for the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to interact in other areas of their relations.For decades the international community has been staggered by the arms race. For many years the United Nations has been addressing this vital and complex question  in the final analysis  while the nuclear-armed States  especially the two super-Powers  are primarily responsible to effect real change  all nations must also contribute by working against nuclear proliferation and being supportive of the disarmament process. A stop must be put to this insane race  not merely because of its implications with respect to the survival of mankind but also because  in the stand-off  huge amounts continue to be spent which could otherwise be channelled into more constructive pursuits. We are encouraged by the United States and the Soviet negotiators closing the ground on an agreement covering medium and short-range nuclear missiles. The two super-Powers must enter into serious negotiations on strategic weapons and a nuclear test ban. It is hoped that these negotiations will pave the way for agreements covering the whole range of nuclear disarmament. In this context the recommendations of the recently concluded International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development will provide some impetus for change in the flow of resources from armament to economic and social development at both the national and international levels.The security and well-being of the peoples of the world cannot be separated from social and economic development. In fact  the United Nations has an equally pivotal role to play in this regard. For the past few years the international community has had to grapple with the growing international debt problem  continuing recessionary trends in commodity prices  major problems in food and agriculture and  in general  international trade. Protectionist measures are on the rise and are being manifested in new legislation and trade restrictive actions in developed countries.It is difficult to envisage any progress in the international trading environment  unless the developed countries themselves believe in the need to maintain a more liberal and open international trade system and give favourable and differential treatment to developing countries. It is to the interest of all to adopt steps to roll bade protectionism and resuscitate international trade. It is for this reason that Malaysia sees a significance in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations.The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII) concluded recently with a consensus agreement. We are encouraged by this result as it manifests a common desire of States to consult together on major economic problems confronting the world today. We are particularly pleased that all the obligations for the establishment of the Common Fund have been fulfilled. Malaysia would wish to see the Common Fund activated to strengthen trade as well as research and development in commodities. We stand ready to participate positively in bringing equilibrium back to commodity prices.The international economic trends of the 1980s have convinced us that the pressing economic problems confronting the international economy cannot be resolved in isolation by a particular group of countries  be they developed or developing. Malaysia firmly believes that multilateral co-operation provides an effective means to overcome these problems. We cannot ignore the fact that the world economy is characterized by the high concentration of decision-making power among a few developed countries. Indeed  no country or bloc of countries should claim the wisdom to prescribe cures for what ails the global economy. The close interdependence of the global economy has time and again proved resistant to such selective prescription. Developing and developed countries must honestly acknowledge this simple reality and work together. The best way is to enter into global negotiations. We appeal to those few countries that still have reservations to show goodwill and magnanimity.Malaysia also believes that meaningful co-operation need not be confined between the developed and the developing countries. Substantial gains are in store for South-South co-operation - that is  between and among the developing countries themselves. Arguably  while most developing countries share somewhat similar levels of development and are competitive in their efforts  there remains among them  this is not true of developing countries. This provides opportunities for meaningful and mutually beneficial co-operation among the developing countries themselves. Malaysia has been a prime mover in the call for accelerated South-South co-operation· We welcome the establishment of the South Commission headed by Mr. Julius Nyerere former President of Tanzania  and look forward to the early commencement of work by the Commission and its recommendations for specific projects for South-South co-operation.In recent years some institutions of multilateralism have been under increasing attacks by a few - bringing in vogue the description that there is now a retreat from multilateralism"". However the ""retreat"" has not brought about solutions to the many problems confronting the international community. On the contrary  it has exacerbated these problems. To our minds  the attainment of a stable and secure world must be accomplished through a genuine search for solutions - through meaningful multilateral co-operation. While we accept that there are various areas of institutional imperfection in the United Nations  as well as in other international forums  the answer to that problem lies neither in being oblivious to those weaknesses nor in ignoring or denigrating the United Nations and the process of multilateralism in general. To begin with we should search objectively for a solution to the financial crisis that has beset the Organization. Some momentum towards alleviating that financial crisis was achieved during the forty-first session of the General Assembly with the adoption by consensus of a resolution that laid down the basis for further efforts. It must be emphasized  however  that we should not run away from our common responsibility regarding the proper functioning of the Organization. It is to be hoped that our deliberations on this important issue during the current session will be directed primarily towards ensuring the financial stability of the United Nations.We cannot overstate the importance of the interests and concerns of mankind that require attention by the United Nations nor the crucial role that the Organization can play in achieving world peace  progress and harmony in the next millennium. We must renew our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter  which represent the collective will and wisdom of our founding fathers and which  remain more than ever relevant to the resolution of the problems of mankind and of the contemporary world."
"101",5051,"NER",42,1987,"﻿For the community of nations  for the peoples of the United Nations and for our Governments  the annual session of the General Assembly is a source of annually renewed hope and a yearly reaffirmation of faith in the enduring validity of the ideals and principles of the Charter of San Francisco. Those ideals and principles reflect the deep-seated and legitimate aspirations of mankind for peace and harmony among nations  for freedom and for economic and social progress for all peoples and all individuals  without distinction. The election of Ambassador Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly is a symbol of that powerful and energizing faith shared in our brotherhood by all the peoples of the earth in our humanity and our common destiny. It is a symbol of the long road travelled since the end of the Second World War  giving true meaning to the uniqueness of our world and the universality of mankind.This election honours him and also recognizes the positive contribution of his country  the German Democratic Republic  in the progress of world affairs. I should like to join my tribute to those already paid him and once again convey my delegation's compliments to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  who conducted the work of our last session with flair  competence and a high sense of responsibility.I would be remiss were I to fail to convey here and now to the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our praise and appreciation for the very useful job he is doing as head of the Organization. He is an attentive and skilful observer of the international scene  and we have seen him  whenever peace is at stake  travelling throughout the world and working actively  with patience and tenacity  to promote the dialogue that is so indispensable to the achievement of understanding among all parties. On behalf of Niger  I commend him for this.In spite of the slow improvement to be seen here and there  the international political situation is still in many areas of the world the cause of grave concern for our Governments and peoples.This is true of the southern part of the African continent  which the racist minority regime of Pretoria has transformed  through its stubbornness and arrogance  into a smouldering hotbed that imperils the security of the entire region  and indeed  world peace. The situation created and maintained in that part of the African continent by the racist minority regime of Pretoria is one of the most serious challenges to the authority of the United Nations and an intolerable affront to the conscience of mankind.How can we accept the fact that  despite repeated calls by the General Assembly and the Security Council  South Africa continues illegally to occupy the Territory of Namibia  plunder its natural resources and systematically murder or imprison all those Namibians who reject the colonial status being imposed on them and struggle to regain their rights? How can we tolerate a situation in which South Africa is constantly carrying out acts of aggression against the front-line States and  with the assistance of armed bands created and financed for its own evil purposes  is continuing to organize assaults  assassinations  abductions and acts of sabotage? How can we accept the persistence of the loathsome system of apartheid  which is a negation of the very values that form the bedrock of peace and that this Organization was established to defend?No  there can be no compromise with apartheid and its masters. There can be no compromise with that policy under which man denies man and through which ail the values that millions of men sacrificed their lives to defend are trampled underfoot  values the international community ardently champions. No one that desires progress  no one with a conscience  can sleep peacefully while that hateful system persists in that part of the world  a system under which men deny other men the mere right to exist.In the light of the ineffectiveness of verbal censure and condemnations  the General Assembly and other international bodies have recommended comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa. The purpose of such sanctions would be to force the minority racist regime of Pretoria to abandon its inhuman policy of apartheid and implement the United Nations peace plan for Namibia's accession to independence. We have to note that all such actions have so far been thwarted by South Africa  which  strengthened by those that overtly or covertly aid and abet it  continues to defy the United Nations and the international community.I should like at this juncture to reaffirm Niger's and its people's support for and solidarity with the peoples of Namibia and South Africa in their liberation struggle and with the front-line States  the victims of repeated acts of aggression by the minority racist regime of Pretoria. Niger calls for determined action by the international community to speed Namibia's attainment of independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and for the dismantling of the system of apartheid.Of course  on the African continent Chad is another dangerous hotbed of tension that must be promptly eliminated. It calls for vigilant attention on the part of the Assembly  in conjunction with initiatives already undertaken within the framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). As a watchful neighbour  ready to help wherever possible  Niger has associated itself with many of the initiatives undertaken to restore peace to Chad. The return of peace to that country presupposes peace among all the people of Chad  in keeping with the ideals and principles of the charter of African unity non-interference in that country's internal affairs and respect for its independence and the unity and integrity of its territory. There is no other possible path towards peace.Niger welcomes the significant progress that has been made in the process of national reconciliation initiated and patiently pursued by the Chad Government. Similarly  we support the action undertaken by the Organization of African Unity through its Ad Hoc Committee under the chairmanship of El-Hadj Oman Bongo  President of the Republic of Gabon. In a new approach designed to find a solution to the problem of Chad  the recent summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa in July of this year  upgraded the membership of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on the Chad-Libyan conflict to Head-of-State level and urged all parties to co-operate with it. It is heartening that at the recent meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee at Lusaka there was for the first time effective participation by the two parties  thus consolidating the cease-fire declared on 11 September 1987 at the request of the then Chairman of the OAU. The Lusaka meeting also drew up and adopted a precise working timetable  including  inter alia  another meeting of Heads of States members of the Ad Hoc Committee with the Heads of State of Chad and Libya.In our view  it is important for all of us to support and recognize the efforts of the OAU.In the final communiqué issued at the conclusion of the Lusaka meeting the members of the Ad Hoc Committee expressed their concern at ""the risks of the internationalisation"" of the Chad-Libyan conflict. Such risks exist and must be averted at any cost. The international community must see to it that they are.Chad and Libya  for their part  must understand that they cannot live in mutual exclusivity; they cannot remake geographical facts or redraw the map of the world to suit themselves. They are condemned to live together. As neighbours  they have a duty to respect each other  accommodate each other and live in harmony. They must ensure that their relations comply with the inescapable demands of good-neighbourliness.The problem of western Sahara  too  continues to maintain a regrettable level of tension in the north-western part of the African continent. In a profound desire to see peace and understanding once again prevail among the countries of the Maghreb  Niger has resolutely supported all the efforts undertaken so far to achieve a just and lasting settlement of that problem. In this connection we welcome the recent attempts to reach understanding at the meeting in Ujda  and we warmly congratulate His Majesty King Fahd Ibn Abdel-Aziz of Saudi Arabia on his tireless efforts to ease the tension in that part of our continent. At the same time  I must commend the Secretary-General for his discreet  patient and useful work. We encourage him to persist in his activities in order to establish in the Organization favourable conditions for a referendum on self-determination in the Sahara  which is the only way to find a lasting solution to that difficult question.Elsewhere in the world other hotbeds of tension are causing anguish and concern and call for concerted action by the international community. One of these is the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  two members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the United Nations that would normally have every reason to be in close association. That war  now in its eighth year  has in recent weeks undergone an escalation that has increased the danger and threat to the whole of the Arab-Persian Gulf. Only the cessation of hostilities and the acceptance of dialogue can lead to a just and lasting peace. Niger welcomes the adoption by the Security Council on 20 July of resolution 598 (19í(7) and urgently appeals to both patties to the conflict to accept its terms and co-operate with the Secretary-General in its implementation.The chances for a negotiated  comprehensive and lasting settlement of the diddle East problem still seem remote. The fundamental and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people continue to be disregarded and denied. Israel persists in occupying Arab territories and  as part of its plan to present the international community with a fait accompli  is actively changing the demographic structure and the legal  cultural and religious status of the Palestinian territories  including Jerusalem. International opinion has often spoken out against these practices and demanded that Israel withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories  put an end to the mistreatment meted out to the populations of those territories and cease exploiting their resources. At the same time  the Lebanese tragedy drags on amid a kind of general indifference on the part of the international community.In both cases  Israel must understand that its own existence cannot forever be guaranteed by means of force but that it can be guaranteed by a peaceful  comprehensive and lasting solution or the Palestinian problem and  more generally  the Middle East question. It must accept that the question of Palestine is at the hub of the conflict in the Middle East and that peace in the region involves giving the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  the right to participate on an equal footing in any negotiation process aimed at finding a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East.Central America  also  is a constantly troubled region  and the General Assembly should continue to give it close attention. For many years that region has been caught up in a grave crisis marked by military confrontation  social instability and manifold and complex inter-State tensions. There are now fresh grounds for hope with the drafting of the Guatemala peace plan by the States of the region  which Niger warmly welcomes.We also continue to follow closely developments in the Korean peninsula  where the situation remains extremely tense. We encourage the efforts undertaken by the two Koreas to bring about the peaceful reunification of their great nation.With respect to the situations in Kampuchea and in Afghanistan  Niger wishes once again to reaffirm the unacceptability of occupation by force of territories belonging to other countries in contravention of the norms of international law and the principles of the United Nations Charter. The international community must continue to strive to make it possible for each of those countries to decide on its political orientation fully and of its own free will and for its population freely to choose its future. It must also ensure that their status as non-aligned countries is safeguarded and respected. It is generally accepted that the uncontrolled arms race is one of the most serious and daunting challenges facing our world. Everyone is aware that a nuclear conflagration would imperil the whole of human civilization and would annihilate all forms of life on Earth. It is therefore vital that the great Powers and all countries concerned abandon their nuclear programmes and embark on a bold and courageous policy of total disarmament. We are witnessing a historic moment for mankind - historic because it is crucial for the future of mankind on Earth  history would record the wise decision of countries possessing nuclear capability to abandon their programmes and destroy the apparatus of destruction installed in many areas of the world. Such a decision would enhance man's stature and bring him into harmony with his environment and with himself because it would prove he is capable of reason and knows how to stop something when he must.We  the developing countries  close observers or this state of affairs  feel despair and revulsion at seeing colossal sums amounting to billions of dollars being swallowed up in this mad adventure whose sole aim  ultimately  is the annihilation of mankind  while in vast regions of the world millions of men and women barely subsist amid total destitution  struggling day to day merely to stay alive.The agreement in principle reached just two weeks ago by the United states and the Soviet Union on the elimination of intermediate-range missiles is encouraging in this respect because it gives us some ground to hope for the advent of a world less ridden with uncertainty.The political concerns I have just mentioned must be seen together with other pressing anxieties bound up in the grave  deep and prolonged crisis in the world economy.The economic situation of the countries of the third world continues to be difficult - indeed it is more difficult than ever  and its most critical aspect is the mounting burden of debt. Thus  although the debt whole of Africa is quantitatively far less than that of other continents - and even of certain individual countries - it has become intolerable for most of the countries of Africa because of the economic crisis prevailing on the continent. For most of those countries debt servicing has reached 30 per cent of total export earnings  the level regarded as the maximum tolerable for any one country. For some of them  debt servicing is equivalent to 6 0 per cent of export earnings  while for others it simply equals 100 per cent.The Assembly will agree with me that to pay debt servicing at such a level is economic madness. It is simply impossible. Thus  despite their sincere desire to honour their contractual commitments  many African States are today finding themselves unable to do so because of their economic situation.The means that have been explored up to now have not been promising in terms of finding satisfactory solutions to this problem. These range from unilateral measures taken by debtors to rescheduling policies advocated by creditors. Niger takes the view that only dialogue and concerted action will enable us to find a solution to the dent problem. Creditors and debtors must get together to think about and discuss bold and innovative initiatives that might be taken in this regard.In addition to the question of debt there arises the whole problem of the recovery of the African economies severely hit by the crisis. At the special session devoted to the economic situation on the continent  the international community recognized the reality  depth and gravity of this crisis. It acknowledged that Africa  despite its enormous potential  remains the least developed of all the continents. All the economic indicators set Africa far behind other continents. The crisis has led to a marked fall in per capita income and to stagnant or even negative rates of growth in many countries.After all the forecasts  the prospects for recovery  growth and developmentremain extremely precarious  unless the efforts now being undertaken by African countries receive full support from the international community. Africa received that support in May 1986 at the special session of the General Assembly  However  nearly a year and a half after adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  we are bound to note that Africa's partners are at a standstill when it comes to meeting their commitments. Meanwhile  Africa  in the framework of this undertaking of joint responsibility  has adopted structural adjustment programmes and recovery measures at the cost of incalculable sacrifices. Despite the already encouraging results  African countries have not received from the industrialized countries the aid and assistance necessary for them to achieve true economic recovery.This continent  which is filled with life and hope  deserves a more positive response from the international community. Africa  which was the cradle of mankind and has contributed very significantly to the development and flourishing of major civilizations  has also  at critical moments in their history  stood at the side of certain now major nations  which it helped to defend and preserve. It is thus only right and just that those nations should now help Africa to overcome its difficulties.Africa urgently needs assistance  in particular to deal with the most critical agricultural and food situation that it has ever had to face. The recovery of African agriculture is a pre-condition of the development of the continent. Thus  for countries such as my own  the development strategy is based primarily on agricultural development. This option is clearly reaffirmed in Niger's five-year economic and social development plan for 19B7 to 1991  concerning which a round-table meeting of donors was held in Geneva last July. Niger's major partners welcomed the relevance and seriousness of the policies and strategies underlying the economic and social development programmes of my Government. A commitment was made to support them and help give effect to them. I reaffirm the deep gratitude of the people and leaders of Niger to all our partners. In this key sector  agriculture  we have to face the adverse natural conditions  struggle against the disastrous consequences of drought and desertification in the Sahel and establish the hydro-agricultural infrastructures which are indispensable if we are to become self-sufficient in food. The effort we have to make is therefore considerable  but we are determined to make it. Among the many initiatives taken by the Government  which all reflect this determination  I have already mentioned the Maradi commitment  which marked the birth of the master plan for combating desertification and drought of the countries members of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) and the organization of genuine mobilization of the people to combat the phenomena of degradation of the environment. Niger welcomes  in this respect  the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development  under the chairmanship of Mrs. Brundtland  the Prime Minister of Norway. This report rightly notes the indissoluble link between protection of the environment and the well-being of mankind. It is impossible to divorce the problems of the environment from economic and development questions. We endorse the conclusions of the World Commission which are in keeping with those of the ""Silva"" conference held in February 1986 in Paris. It must be admitted that if we do not draw up here and now a really sustained policy of protection of the environment covering both agricultural production and livestock and action to combat desertification  we shall be endangering the very basis of the future of all of us. The tragic effects of desertification in the Sanel  and particularly in Niger  prove that every time the balance between man and his natural environment is disrupted the vicious cycle of drought and hunger become a constant fact of life.It is in this context that we must consider the farming season this year in Niger  which is causing us great concern and giving us very little cause for hope. A very late rainy season and rainfall which was badly distributed both in area and in time have made it impossible for us to meet our food needs for the coming year. According to the estimates of our technical services  we shall have a deficit in cereals of approximately 350 000 tons at the end of the current farming season. However  provision to meet this deficit has already been made by my Government both using its own resources and through the generous support of the international community.Thus  we need to buy seed  fertilizer and ploughing and irrigation equipment. Above all  in a country where more than half the land is desert  we need to mobilize all available energies to halt the advance of the desert  prevent sand storms from covering over the few oases that exist or destroying the scarce layers of fertile or cultivable soil.These ate the concerns of the people of Niger. It is clear from all the speeches that I have heard since the opening of this session that they are also the concerns of many other nations of the world hungry for peace  freedom and progress. These hopes give particular value to the activities that we are pursuing here.President Seyni Kountche said from this rostrum: ""Together with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the United Nations Charter is certainly the finest  the most noble and the most relevant resolution that mankind has ever adopted."" (A/36/PV.25  p.27)It is all this because it embodies all our hopes and makes this forum the irreplaceable setting within which to achieve them."
"102",5096,"NGA",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the Nigerian delegation  I should like to offer our congratulations  Sir  on your unanimous and well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. My delegation joins previous speakers in expressing our sentiments on your distinguished personal merits  which have eminently qualified you for this high office. I have no doubt that under your able leadership this session will achieve great success. I therefore have great pleasure in pledging to you the full support and co-operation of my delegation in the performance of your onerous task. We approach the work of the current session of this Assembly with a sense of objective realism. The original aims and objectives of the Charter hold even more true today in the quest for a peaceful world order and an enhanced process of economic development. It falls to the present members of this world Assembly to ensure the realization of those lofty ideals. The Charter  as applied from the inception of this Organization and strengthened by decisions and resolutions that reflect a preponderance of shared views and aspirations  remains sufficiently flexible to make possible the current effort to reform the structure of the United Nations system.The reform measures put in place by the Secretary-General reflect a determined attempt to implement General Assembly resolution 41/213. This is admittedly a daunting task which we once again insist must remain faithful to the main purposes and objectives towards which the united Nations has directed its efforts for so many years. The world can ill afford to strip this Organization of its effectiveness and the universalist principles that have lent themselves to the aspirations of all member States  big and small  rich and poor. The need to reduce staff and costs must never obscure the need for the efficacy of collaborative efforts which the Organization has come to represent. The Organization must remain committed to the rigorous pursuit of such laudable ventures as are exemplified by resolution S-13/2  adopted at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly to assist African economic recovery and development. It is our strong belief that nothing should detract from this Organization's resolve to maintain this programme on a priority list of issues which deserves a higher allocation of resources.My delegation will support the ongoing process of reform provided it is geared to efficiency without any decrease in the adequate allocation of resources  be they human  financial or material. Unfortunately  however   every  attempt at restructuring the Secretariat that occurred earlier this year is certain to undermine the wide-ranging support originally pledged to that process by member States. The Secretary-General must now focus his attention solely on a reorganization that ensures administrative efficiency. More important  it must be carried out with full cognisance of the tenets of the United Nations Charter regarding the sovereign equality of all member states.In order to facilitate a smooth reordering of priorities and invigoration of a worth-while institutional framework geared to the achievement of development  the world needs peace. It deserves peace. yet this ideal situation continues to elude us. The African continent  which has most of the world's least developed countries  is unfortunately  plagued by intractable conflicts. Most of these conflicts can be traced to the nefarious activities of the racist minority regime in apartheid South Africa.My Government has consistently drawn the attention of the international community to the plight of millions of indigenous inhabitants of South Africa. We have collaborated with an ever-widening cycle of concerned nations  which continue to urge those countries whose actions and pronouncements tend to embolden the apartheid regime in its open defiance of world opinion  to be mindful of the enormity of the negative stand they have taken.More than ever before  the need for the international community to take concrete and effective measures towards the eradication of apartheid  which has been roundly condemned as a crime against humanity  cannot be over-emphasized.The apartheid regime has torn families apart and destroyed humble places of abode of its largely impoverished African population. It has set Soweto ablaze  brutalized teenage Africans through torture and imprisonment. It dehumanised the indigenous population by relegating it to a state of statelessness. Today  over 100 laws are in place to stifle all shades of opinion  in particular  the media.Friends of the apartheid regime have  in the past few years  delighted themselves with cosmetic measures  which the racists played up to the world as reforms  while its friends extolled these empty gestures  we have never relented in our steadfast opposition to this palliative political posturing. For  there can be no real peace in South Africa until the whole ignoble edifice of apartheid is completely dismantled.Yet we cannot deny that in the past few years the majority of ordinary citizens  private organizations  educational institutions  religious and other well-meaning organizations in many countries have demonstrated their abhorrence of this unjust rule either by pulling their investments out of South Africa  or by vigorously urging their Governments to apply economic sanctions against the racists. We watch with deep interest and satisfaction the very mature approach of students  businessmen and trade unions in taking concrete action which underlines their commitment to political freedom and economic emancipation for the majority of South Africans. Regrettably  however  certain powerful individuals in high government positions remain unmoved. But the wind of change unleashed in the streets of Sharpeville  and strengthened in the classrooms of Soweto  has become a hurricane  which  as it gathers force  will no doubt sweep away all vestiges of repression and the unjust laws of the apartheid regime.The process of shaping international opinion towards decisive action has been long and at times frustrating. But the present situation augurs well for 23 million Africans in South Africa. The positive roles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the Nordic countries  the socialist States and a few Western countries are noteworthy. The groundswell of the anti-apartheid movement in the United States has now assumed such proportions that the Congress has unequivocally demonstrated its desire for positive change in the apartheid enclave. Apartheid is no longer perceived along partisan  ideological or racial lines.The policy of Nigeria with regard to South Africa is clearly one of honour  but it is also one that holds firmly to the basic principles of the United Nations Charter  we have always stated that our belief in the armed struggle in South Africa and Namibia is predicated on the necessity to wrest  from an unjust order  those basic freedoms that many nations have always fought for in Europe and America. In this regard we also support a dialogue  conducted on the basis of true racial equality  to resolve the issue of the total eradication of apartheid. Let the racists talk to the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) with a view to bringing to an end the violence they started  and this Organization can then squarely face other major issues which still promote division in international relations.The United Nations' failure  so far  to resolve the issue of Namibia's independence is inextricably intertwined with all the problems that call for early resolution in southern Africa. Racism and racial discrimination have always characterized Namibia's subjugation by South Africa. When in 1978 the Security Council agreed on a plan for the independence of Namibia  the world thought that the end of the indigenous population's nightmare was in sight. However  at the prompting of its Western friends  purely extraneous issues were introduced to ensure the denial of freedom to the Namibian people. Nigeria firmly repudiates the infamous linkage concept. We also reject any makeshift political devices that exclude recognition of the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people. The encouragement of break-away factions only serves the purposes of apartheid South Africa  and the economic exploitation of the unholy alliance in that territory. The United Nations Council for Namibia must be strengthened to enable it effectively to administer the territory until the plan envisaged under Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has been fully implemented.Last year  the General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring the South Atlantic a zone of peace and co-operation. This was and still remains  in Nigeria's view  a laudable gesture. It is my delegation's belief that the nations contiguous to the South Atlantic remain under an obligation to keep this zone free of super-Power rivalry  thus maintaining its innocent nature.My country is eager to co-operate with any neighbouring country in any endeavour to achieve this objective. We are prepared to co-operate with all nations bordering the South Atlantic in efforts to guarantee freedom of navigation weather-forecasting and all plans favourable to environmental protection thereby ensuring that the interests of all humanity are adequately protected. To our South American friends we offer the vision of the South Atlantic Ocean as an ocean that unites rather than separates us.The situation that exists between Chad and Libya is  to say the least  unfortunate and highly regrettable. The Organization of African Unity has mediated and continues to seek a peaceful solution to the problem. It is essential therefore that we should all give full support to the cause of peace that is being promoted by the OAU in this matter· We are therefore happy that the General Assembly deferred the inclusion of this matter in its agenda in order to give more time for further consultation.An opportunity for such consultation took place at the summit level on 24 September 1987  in Lusaka  Zambia. It re-established a climate of dialogue which  we believe  will enhance the process of peaceful resolution of the conflict. In fact  the two parties to the conflict have reaffirmed their commitment and willingness to work towards a negotiated settlement of the dispute. In addition  they have accepted the OAU framework for its resolution.In this regard the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on the dispute underlined the need o find a peaceful  African solution to it and warned against its internationalisation. We  therefore  call on the Assembly and the international community to respect Africa's wishes. We call for respect for the OAU peace efforts with regard to the conflict so that there may be a rapid return of peace to the area so that resources may be devoted to the process of development.My delegation does not believe that the situation in the Middle East is beyond resolution. The fact is that in the absence of the political will to accord to the Palestinians the right to their own homeland  one of the main actors would have been pushed into the background. The main issues in a possible negotiation process would have been ignored. Just as Nigeria would reiterate the right of Israel to exist  my delegation is convinced that the role of peace would be served if all concerned also believed in peaceful coexistence. To this end  my delegation fully supports the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  where all the main actors in the protracted dispute would be represented. We do not share the view that the peace process would be served by a denial of the right of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to be represented at such a conference. When  on 20 July 1987  the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution which called for the cessation of hostilities between Iraq and Iran  the world heaved a sigh of relief. To render Security Council resolution 598 (1987) effective  we call on all those countries whose naval power is currently being flaunted in the Gulf to withdraw. There is no excuse for calling for the cessation of hostilities on the one hand  only shortly after to proceed with amassing an array of sophisticated naval fire-power that can only make it more difficult to achieve peace. It is doubly disappointing that both Iraq and Iran  two friends of Nigeria of long standing  have not yet achieved the peace they need for socio-economic development.In like manner  the people of Afghanistan deserve peace. To this end  we commend the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Representative to achieve national reconciliation.My delegation believes that the time has come to enable the people of Kampuchea to embark on reconstruction and development after such a protracted period of conflict and instability. The chronicle of unfortunate events in a friendly country  a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  is of great concern to my delegation. We urge all sides in this dispute to demonstrate their respect for the territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Kampuchea by implementing the relevant General Assembly resolutions to this effect.Since 1985 the world has been given reason to believe that the end of the arms race is 9 little closer. The announcement by the super-Powers that a new round of disarmament talks in Geneva would tackle the reduction of nuclear arms  leading to their eventual elimination  was hailed by my Government as a step in the right direction. My delegation welcomes the 18 September announcement that the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have agreed in principle to a treaty to eliminate medium- and short-range missiles. We continue to urge all the nuclear States to devote greater energies to the total elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.For 26 years the United Nations has urged that a test-ban treaty should be signed by nuclear-power States. A moratorium on testing would therefore seem a very logical approach. Accordingly  my delegation commended the Soviet union for its bold initiative last year unilaterally to impose a moratorium on weapons testing. Unfortunately  that commendable initiative has been brought to an end. It is even more regrettable that others were unable to reciprocate  thus making the search for a nuclear-weapon-free world that much more difficult.There is a clear complementarily between disarmament  development and security. For instance  world military expenditure is currently estimated at $1 trillion  while the combined debt burden of all the developing countries is about the same amount. My delegation firmly supports any move to set aside some of this huge expenditure on armaments for development purposes. Care must be taken not to allow an otherwise praiseworthy idea to become entangled in ideological pretension.The recently concluded Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development failed to achieve its main objective. Although it agreed on basic definitions  extraneous ideas were adopted which tended to elevate the abstract ""essence of armed security above that of trade and development. The failure to adopt any categorical plan for the release through financing arrangements of resources that it is hoped would be saved by disarmament may render further progress difficult. The current world economic situation  particularly for developing countries  leaves much to be desired. While substantial growth has continued in developed countries for the	consecutive year  the economic prospects for developing countries in general  and those of Africa in particular  continue to remain very bleak: Despite the painstaking efforts of most of the developing countries to undertake some appreciable levels of structural adjustment they continue to be haunted by monetary debt problems  insurmountable debt service problems falling commodity prices  unjustified protectionism in some developed countries against developing countries' commodities  and high interest rates.It will be recalled that in May 1986 a special session of the General Assembly was Held which resulted in the adoption of a United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  to be implemented at the national  regional and international levels· In spite of the national measures taken by African countries in the form of structural adjustment  and at the international level in support of the United Nations Programme by way of the $12.4 billion replenishment of the International Development Association  45 per cent of which is to be allocated to sub-Saharan Africa  it is still unlikely that an adequate financial flow will be provided to bridge the financing gap which Africa is expected to face until 1990 and beyond.The Conference sponsored by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and devoted exclusively to the challenge of economic recovery and accelerated development in Africa met in Abuja  Nigeria  from 15 to 19 June this year. It recommended a comprehensive approach to aid flows to support structural adjustment programmes in Africa and focused particularly on disbursing funds for spare parts and material needed to increase the utilization of existing capacity in industry  agriculture and public infrastructure. The Conference called for an exceptional measure to reduce the debt service burden of African countries  which should include measures to convert official development assistance debt into grants  longer repayment and grace periods  lower interest rates on existing official debt  and consideration of the possibility of repayment of debts in local currencies by African countries. I whole-heartedly commend these recommendations to the Assembly.Our concern focuses on the fact that a lot is expected of us by way of sacrifice  but it seems that nothing is being realized in return for the sacrifices we have made and continue to make. In the recent past  certain proposals were made by some developed countries to alleviate Africa's crippling debt crisis. Unfortunately  the promises of the Baker plan  British proposals on rescheduling and low interest rate concessions to developing countries have not been fully implemented.Despite these efforts  a lot more is still required to meet the expanding resource demands of developing countries  particularly when net private foreign investment has also fallen back substantially  from an estimated $17 2 billion at the peak in 1981 for all capital importing developing countries to $7.7 billion in 1985. Thus  the requirement that developing countries finance debt service from trade surpluses rather than from additional capital inflows remains untenable.I have no doubt that when the Secretary-General reports to the Assembly on his efforts in dealing with the financial crisis of Africa  we shall be well briefed on the practical and politically acceptable proposals put forward by the expert group which he set up in April to deal with debt relief and financial flows to African countries. This Assembly and the international community in general can do a lot to support the Programme of Action and proposals that will provide Africa in particular and developing countries in general with the essential external resource input necessary for their development. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  which was held in Geneva in July and August of this year  provided the international community with a unique opportunity to negotiate an agreement on the interrelated issues of debt  resource flows  trade and development. That Conference gave recognition to the belief that any resolution of the debt Question must be within the context of the need to foster growth and development in the developing world. In Geneva  the international community agreed that while developing nations need to restructure their economies  there is a corresponding obligation on the developed nations to increase resource flows to third-world nations. The seventh session of UNCTAD agreed that since the collapse of commodity prices has accentuated the debt burden of developing nations there is urgent need for producers and consumers of raw materials to work together to strengthen commodity agreements  not only because of the need to restore commodity prices to remunerative and equitable levels  but also to revitalize co-operation between the developed and developing nations. The seventh session of UNCTAD reminded us all that multilateral co-operation is a catalyst for reviving the world economy as a whole.It cannot be assumed that ideas  or even mechanisms  for furthering solutions to pressing issues concerning the world economy should be pursued only in the North-South context. On the contrary  developing countries not only are keenly aware of but have  through various mechanisms  given concrete expression to the need to exploit the potential for co-operation among themselves in the economic and technical fields. Nigeria  in close collaboration with its partners in the Economic Community of West African States  has taken steps to invigorate our sub region's capacity to achieve rapid economic recovery through trade liberalization and the pooling of resources. Yet all joint programmes  worked out with the active co-operation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa  as well as the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  can achieve the desired goal only if the problems of debt  stabilization of exchange rates and greater access to the markets of the developed countries are resolved.The 1972 United Nations Conference on the Environment  held in Stockholm  was an important milestone since it not only sensitised concern for but also helped to fashion a global consensus on issues of the environment. That Conference has generated in its wake a number of initiatives on the environment  culminating in the establishment of the World Commission on Environment and Development  which has issued a report entitled Our Common Future.My Government welcomes that report. We take particular satisfaction in its basic message that there is a close connection between ecology and economy and a need to ensure that sustainable development does not impair the capacity of future generations to meet their own requirements.We care very deeply about the issue of the environment  as is demonstrated by the measures we have instituted to safeguard our environment. None the less we are also keenly aware that major environmental problems are often global in character  and we therefore feel that it is unhelpful to ascribe lack of interest in environmental protection largely to developing countries when they are in fact often marginal to the causes of environmental problems.Furthermore  my Government is of the view that we should guard against translating concern for environmental protection into a new form of conditionality for development assistance by the multilateral development and financial institutions  so that the cost of development will not unnecessarily be made even more burdensome for already overburdened developing countries.The problems of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking have reached alarming proportions. The United Nations sponsored international conference held in Vienna earlier this year was timely. Apart from the severe sanctions contained in Nigeria's domestic laws against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking  Nigeria has  at the international level  signed bilateral agreements with some countries to deal with drug-related issues  especially illicit drug trafficking. Nigeria also has national laws and regulations in conformity with the United Nations conventions on psychoactive drugs. While Nigeria supports the idea of an international convention to deal with drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking  it must be stressed that global uniformity in sanctions against illicit drug trafficking is long overdue. It would certainly put a stop to the movement of drug traffickers from countries with severe sanctions to those with more lenient ones.In conclusion I should like once again to stress my delegation's commitment to the principle of multilateralism in all spheres of activity of the Organization. The United Nations will not be able to achieve a positive role in world events if we stray from the aims and objectives of its Charter. We must therefore be prepared to do more than merely accuse the super-Powers of monopolizing responsibility for and initiatives on the resolution of conflicts.It is our conviction that the time has come when we must all share the responsibility for conflict management through an active commitment to world peace. We must continuously seek to contribute to the basket of ideas that will facilitate such a process. The issue of peace is so critical that we cannot afford to abdicate that responsibility. Ours should be a world of peace; it should be a world of security  and above all it should be a world of justice  where we work together to uphold the principles and tenets of the Charter in order to attain our common future.

"103",5141,"NIC",42,1987,"We	pay	atribute to the memory of Ernesto Guevara today  the twentieth anniversary of the sacrifice of his life.The Bible tells us that Cain killed Abel in the first confrontation between members of the human species. Envy and pride took possession of Cain and made him commit this crime. ""Am I my brother's keeper?"" - that is the way Cain replied to the question put to him at the time.The United Nations came into being at the end of the Second World War with the purpose of avoiding further wars  so that Cains should not kill millions of other Abels  so that all of us on earth would have the duty to be our brothers' keepers.But there have been new wars in various parts of the planet. Millions of us human beings in the developing countries have been and continue to be the victims of such wars. There have been dozens of interventions since 1945 against us  the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America. Millions of men  women and children have been the victims of these policies.The North  which is trampling underfoot and crushing the South  continues to impose the kind of relationship which suits it best; it staunchly defends an unjust international order  including unequal trade  external debt  protectionist measures  the total closing of markets  and pressures on Governments and organs of multilateral co-operation  disrespect and disregard for the Charter and the bodies of the United Nations and for the international legal order. All that leaves the peoples of the developing countries utterly defenseless.In the midst of such suffering  we welcome and applaud the progress made between the Soviet Union and the United States towards taking steps to ensure disarmament  including the prohibition and then the elimination of nuclear and chemical weapons.As a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  however  we are concerned about wars between brother peoples. We join in the international clamor for the cessation of the war between Iran and Iraq  and we stress the danger of the presence and build-up of foreign military forces in the Gulf.Also as a non-aligned country  we ask ourselves what we are doing and what we can do to prevent the death each year of between 20 million and 25 million children under the age of five from malnutrition and disease - deaths which could easily be prevented  according to the Brandt report. According to the latest statistics- those of 1986 - 14.1 million children aged five died from disease and malnutrition.Of these  250 000 were from the industrialized countries - 1.7 per cent of the total - while 13 850 000 were from the developing countries - 98.3 per cent of the total. Who defends this carnage that has caused the death of more than 1 billion children since the end of the Second World War? Who will put an end once and for all to the murderous policy of apartheid  racism and the daily killings of the inhabitants of South Africa? Who will put an end to oppression in Chile  Paraguay and Haiti? Who is concerned about this? Either the countries of the North and the international community can take concrete action to meet the just demands of those peoples  or they will continue to be faced with the fait accompli of change  popular movements and revolution.The peoples will not wait for permission to struggle  to fight and to triumph. The peoples will give an impetus to their own processes of change  and then there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth by those that never wished to listen to the peoples and were the accomplices of the oppressors.That is the situation of my country  Nicaragua  where  having intervened militarily and assassinated Sandino  the United States installed the Somoza dictatorship. Against that dictatorship set up by the United States  promoted and defended by the United States  armed and financed by the United States  we Nicaraguans fought to win the freedom which had been denied us.At that time the United States was not concerned about freedom in Nicaragua.At that time the United States did not care about the human rights of Nicaraguans. In those days the United States did not care about the lack of justice. The United States was not concerned then about the thousands of prisoners who were thrown into gaol - including myself  who spent seven years in such gaols. No concern was voiced by the leaders of the United States about the gaols in which we Nicaraguans were suffering or about the killings and tortures that were inflicted on us Nicaraguans.  Without asking permission of the United States  and against its policy and will  we overthrew the Somoza dictatorship not only to win our freedom  but also in the hope of establishing a new type of relationship with the United States  one of mutual respect  not relations between slave and master  as had been the case in the Somoza period  but relations between people  between nations  between States. That is what we wanted - that is what we want - respectful relations with the United States. Moreover  we wanted  and want  friendly relations with the United States. But the response of the United States has been to try to wrest from us our hard-won freedom and send Somoza's former guards back to Nicaragua to rule there.For six years and nine months the United States has been trying to sweep away the Nicaraguan revolution  violating ethic and moral principles  international laws and  indeed  the laws of the United States itself.The President of the United States is to blame for over 45 714 human victims in our country and the $2 821 billion loss in our gross domestic product  as a result of the United States policy in Nicaragua. The United States has bled the Nicaraguan people dry and badly damaged the Nicaraguan economy. This policy on the part of the United States has not benefited the people of Nicaragua at all but has come up against the courage  resoluteness  valor and heroism of this people.The policy of setting up a mercenary army was intended to destroy the legitimately constituted Government in Nicaragua  but it has already failed. The United States has reduced its mercenary army in Nicaragua to 6 500 mercenaries  whereas it wanted to have 30 000 by now. Now all it has is 16 000 refugees in Honduras - people who found themselves obliged to leave for Honduras - and a similar number in Costa Rica  and there are 6 500 mercenaries - freedom fighters  as President Reagan calls them - but they are getting fewer in number all the time  because they are dying in combat or accepting the policy of amnesty which has been in effect since January 1985 for anyone wishing to embrace it.The United States policy has failed and President Reagan is running out of time because his second term of office is coming to a close. He has only a few months left now before he has to leave the presidency of the United States# and it was these objective elements# particularly the failure of United States policy in Nicaragua  that led to the Esquipulas Agreement  because# quite frankly  what would have happened if the United States had achieved its objective of destroying the Nicaraguan revolution in a few months# as it suggested to the Governments of Honduras and Costa Rica when it wanted to set up camps there? If it had destroyed the Nicaraguan revolution  as it destroyed the people of Grenada  nothing more would have happened in Central America.Some people find their ears hurt when the truth is spoken and they are incapable of listening  but that is their business.It seems to me that the culprits are annoyed. They have committed aggression against us and they have killed our people  but now they are upset when the truth is told to them. It is thanks to this reality  the capacity of the Nicaraguan people for resistance  that: the policy and the mercenary forces of the United States have been defeated; that is what made it possible to sign the Esquipulas II agreements. It is thanks also to the perseverance of the Contadora Group and its Support Group which  in a firm Latin American endeavor  have opposed the interventionist policy of the United States.The Esquipulas II Agreement is a transcendental instrument dictated by the common sense of the Latin American leaders  and it is the fruit of the action of the Contadora Group and the Support Group.Nicaragua has taken a number of steps in response to the signing of these agreements  so that on 5 November next  the date which marks the end of the 90-day period for the commencement of the implementation process  there will be better conditions for progress to be made in that process - because the end of the 90-day period is not the end of negotiations but rather a point of departure in the negotiation process.The General Assembly yesterday gave its unanimous support to the leaders of Central America who signed the Esquipulas Agreement. Nicaragua thanks the Assembly for this act of solidarity in the name of peace of the General Assembly. We hope that the Government of the United States will comply with that United Nations resolution  and not by just saying it agrees with Esquipulas II; it is our hope that it will respect the Agreement by observing the terms contained in the Agreement of Esquipulas II. So far  the United States Government has given no indication of willingness to respect that Agreement.That was made clear when President Reagan spoke from this very rostrum earlier in this session of the Assembly  when his tone was one of disrespect for theEsquipulas II Agreement and disrespect for the leaders of Central America. In the speech he made yesterday before the Organization of American States (OAS) President Reagan once again showed disrespect for the Central American Presidents and for the Agreement. He endorsed a kind of conduct which has been condemned by the highest court of justice of all. President Reagan's speech yesterday was a violation of the charter of the Organization of American States and the Charter of the United Nations.President Reagan went to the Organization of American States  as he comes to the United Nations  posing as a great judge of the peoples of the world. Who gave him such power? Who gave the President of the United States such representative status?Let me now take up two aspects he mentioned in his statement yesterday before the Organization of American States. Here I have the Esquipulas Agreement  and here are the signatures of the five Central American Presidents:President Oscar Arias Sanchez  President Jose Napoleon Duarte President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo  President Jose Azcona Hoyos  and myself. Our Eive signatures are right here; President Reagan's is not. If President Reagan wishes to interfere in our negotiating process  let him sign the Esquipulas (Agreement. Then he will be fully entitled to talk about the Agreement as he did before the Organization of American States. We should be delighted if the President of the United States were to subscribe to this Agreement; then we should feel he had the right to discuss these matters  for his signature would be on this Agreement. But to start discussing these things and to make allegations  and to try to impose his will in respect of an Agreement he has not signed - that shows disrespect for those of us who have signed the Agreement  because we are the Leaders of independent sovereign countries. We are not a colony or a neo-colony of :he United States; if we were  the President could feel entitled to come along andsay that the Agreement needs such-and-such corrections. That is all wrong. The worst thing is that it seems he has not even read the Agreement. I am sure President Reagan has not even read the Agreement.I am saying this because he said that he was going to ask for $US 270 million for the mercenaries and that  depending on how the Agreement was carried out  he would pass the money on to the mercenaries.Paragraph 5 of the Esquipulas II Agreement states that:""The Governments of the five Central American States shall request Governments of the region and Governments from outside the region which are providing either overt or covert military  logistical  financial or propaganda support  in the form of men  weapons  munitions and equipment  to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements to terminate such aid; this is vital if a stable and lasting peace is to be attained in the region."" (A/42/521  p. 6) That is quite clear  then.""The above does not cover aid for the repatriation or  failing that  the relocation and necessary assistance with reintegration into normal life of former members of such groups or forces.""When the President goes before the Organization of American States (OAS) and says he is going to ask for $270 million  and also says he supports the agreements  he is being utterly inconsistent. The agreements clearly state that President Reagan should not provide new funds for the mercenary forces; if he wanted to approve new funds  it would have to be for the relocation or repatriation of people who  for example  accept the amnesty  who lay down their arms and go along with the peace process. That money would have to be given to the United Nations  to the Organization of American States (OAS)  or to organizations of the International Verification and Follow-up Commission  so that they could make certain the money was truly spent on relocation and repatriation.President Reagan says he supports the Esquipulas Agreement and then he makes a proposal which goes contrary to the agreement.President Reagan also referred to the question of armaments  military manpower  foreign military advisers  and so on. He said the agreement does not take this into account. But on page 7 the Agreement clearly states:""Negotiations on security  verification and the control and limitation of weapons:""The Governments of the five Central American States  with the Contadora Group acting as mediator  shall continue negotiating on the points outstanding in the draft Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America with regard to security  verification and control."" (A/42/521  p. 7)Here  too  we are clearly talking about a willingness to have ail foreign military advisers leave the region - the willingness of the Central American Governments to undertake not to carry out maneuvers with foreign military advisers  not to set up foreign military bases on our respective territories  and our commitment to convert the Central American region into a zone of peace  free from any foreign military presence.These elements are taken into account in Esguipulas II. President Reagan is wrong to say that they are not. It bothers us that the President of the United States should take such a flippant and disrespectful attitude to this Agreement without being familiar with it  without having read and studied the text carefully. We are really bothered by this  because this is the President of an economic and military power of world standing who is  judging by his remarks  taking this rather lightly. This position of the President of the United States is not contributing to peace  and I think it discredits him further. It bothers us  I say  because it demonstrates a clear decision to press ahead with his policy against all odds. Consequently we are obliged to think that his words are the prelude to the continuation and escalation of a policy which does not rule out the use of United States troops.Logically  Nicaragua rejects the statement of President Reagan before the OAS. The Government of the United States should not forget that the Nicaraguan people has never turned and run  calling for help. There were several invasions in the last century  but we  the Nicaraguan people  responded to those invasions by fighting and struggling to defend peace. Policies based on force have yielded no results. That must be made quite clear  because when the United States Congress approved the $100 million for the mercenaries  as a consequence of that policy based on force  the very next day the La Prensa was closed in Nicaragua  and a bishop was expelled a few days later  one who advocated and supported the United States policy of intervention.The United States policy of force was what drove us to set up a state of emergency in our country. It hardened the situation in our country  if anything. Had it not been for the agreements of Esquipulas II  Nicaragua would not have been able to take the steps it has taken. It is thanks to it that no censorship is applied to the press  which is circulating freely in ray country. The Catholic radio is broadcasting; a national dialog has been set up; we have decreed a cease-fire and formed a National Commission of Reconciliation  and we have taken other steps.Wei Nicaraguans can reach an understanding fairly among ourselves. But we believe that  just as a dialog has begun between the Government of El Salvador and the rebels there  the time has come for a dialog to begin between the Government of the United States and Nicaragua. Although there is no symmetry between El Salvador and Nicaragua  there is a precedent:	before Esquipulas II  theGovernment of El Salvador had engaged in a dialog with the Salvadorian guerrillas. And there is another precedent:	before Esquipulas II  the NicaraguanGovernment had engaged in a dialog with the Government of the United States  at Manzanillo. Those are the precedents  and they correspond to the different realities of the two situations.We have nothing to gain from talking with the leaders of the counter-revolution  and we shall not engage in a dialog with them. If there is a real desire to take up this matter seriously  the dialog must be between the Government of the United States and the Government of Nicaragua  for at the rate they are going the mercenaries are likely to disappear  thanks also to the fighting spirit of our people and the Nicaraguan Government's amnesty Program. Thus  we can see that the problem is not really the mercenaries because they may disappear  but the United States will continue its policy of aggression against Nicaragua; when it has no mercenaries  it will use its own troops.The problem is the behavior of the United States Government and its attitude towards the Nicaraguan revolution. That attitude was clear in Reagan's pre-election platform  before the mercenaries existed. In that political platform. President Reagan advocated the destruction of the Nicaraguan revolution - and there were then no mercenaries. Thus  the issue is not one of engaging in dialog with the leaders of the mercenaries.Yet there is indeed a dialog on the ground between the mercenaries who are there  in Nicaragua  and who are taking a beating from our forces  which gives them an opportunity to accept the amnesty. A dialog is therefore already occurring on the ground  in order to promote acceptance of the amnesty. What is the point of talking to the leadership of the contra mercenaries? There is no point  because the entire policy is promoted by the United States Government. As I said  the mercenaries could disappear  but the United States Government would carry on using other methods. If the United States does not alter its policy towards Nicaragua  there could be a military blockade against us; there could be ""surgical"" strikes; there could be a military invasion. Thus  resumed dialog would be the logical thing. I say ""resumed"" because there is a precedent: there already has been a dialog between us and the Government of the United States. We received Secretary of State Shultz in Managua  where I spoke with him  and there have been other meetings  at Manzanillo  Mexico - meetings which the United States broke off abruptly.If we have already had a dialog  why do we not sit down again and have another?Here in this United Nations forum  I hereby issue an invitation to the President of the United States:	Thirty-five	days from 5 November  the UnitedStates and Nicaragua should begin an unconditional bilateral dialog with a view to signing agreements providing security for both States and making possible the normalization of their bilateral relations.Why should this take place 35 days from 5 November? The fifth of November is when the implementation of the agreements will begin  and there follows a 30-day period  at the end of which the International Verification and Follow-up Commission is to meet  with the participation of the United Nations  the Organization of American States (QAS)   the Contadora Group  the Support Group and the Central American countries  to analyze progress in the implementation of the agreements  we therefore think it appropriate that the Government of the United States have an opportunity to observe - not interfere with - the implementation of the agreements  ind await the analysis by the International Verification and Follow-up Commission  i dialog could then begin five days later  after the United States has considered .hat analysis. We could take up the dialog where we left it off.I hope the President of the United States will not act as his delegation acted today. When President Reagan addressed the Assembly  the delegation of Nicaragua listened to him. We are not afraid of words; we are not afraid of political and ideological debate. A year ago I myself sat in this Hall and listened to President Reagan.I hope that President Reagan will not respond to this proposal for bilateral dialog in the same way his delegation responded here in the General Assembly Hall today. President Reagan should not hasten to say no to that proposal; let him reflect. Let him ask himself why United States citizens such as Benjamin Linder and Brian Wilson have shed their own blood to prevent more bloodshed in Nicaragua. Let President Reagan ask himself why the United States National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the leaders of evangelical churches have issued several messages calling on him to end his policy. Let the President of the United States ask himself why Roy Bourgeois  a Catholic priest  has spent several months in a high-security prison in Louisiana. Other Catholic priests too are being gaoled for civil opposition to the United States Government's policy of death against Nicaragua.President Reagan should not hasten to say no. Before consulting those who give him hot-headed ideas  such as military options  including outright invasion  let him remember that Rambo exists only in the movies.In Viet Nam the result was the death of thousands of Vietnamese and also of more than 40 000 young Americans who were sent over there to die in Viet Nam  young United States citizens who would today be scientists  educators  technicians  clergy  athletes  farmers or doctors.The peoples do not want Rambos; the peoples want men of peace.Before responding to my proposal for a bilateral dialog  we hope that President Reagan will not rush into saying anything. Let him think  and may God enlighten him and help him choose the road to peace and stop harming the people of Nicaragua."
"104",5188,"NLD",42,1987,"﻿May I join other delegations in congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-second session. I am fully confident that the experience and wisdom which is yours will enable you to guide us efficiently throughout the months of challenging work that lie before us. My friend and colleague Mr· Ellemann-Jensen  Foreign Minister of Denmark  addressed the Assembly earlier this week  expressing the views of the Twelve members of the European Community on some major international problems we are faced with in the world today. The Netherlands fully shares the views he expressed on that occasion.With satisfaction we note a distinct improvement of the international climate. As a number of speakers before roe have done  we warmly welcome the agreement in principle reached last week in Washington by Secretary of State Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze on the complete elimination of longer and shorter-range intermediate nuclear forces. This significant outcome augurs well not only for relations between East and West but for the entire world community.In this Organization a better appreciation by Member States of the limits and possibilities of international co-operation is emerging. Between North and South there seems to be a growing willingness to listen to each other and to strive for mutual accommodation and practical progress  as was recently evident at the Seventh Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). We observe a new sense of realism or - as some might prefer to call it - of pragmatic idealism. This gives us the feeling that we are gradually leaving behind the days of polarization  I hope that this will prove to be a lasting trend.Prospects for increasing the relevance of the United Nations therefore appear favourable· As was rightly stressed in a recent thought-provoking report by the United Nations Association of the United States of America  the United Nations needs  within the framework of the Charter  ""a sharper definition of goals  a more effective deployment of means and a revitalized mandate"". After all  one of the main problems confronting this Organization has been its vague and often over-ambitious programmes together with limited possibilities for their implementation. Therefore  I whole-heartedly agree with the Secretary-General when he states in his annual report that pragmatism and vision can go together and that ""... a vision without the definition of realistic means of approaching it can lead to disillusionment and cynicism"". (P/42/1  p. 17) . It is striking to see how the United Nations is reasserting the role envisaged for it in the Charter  both with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security and with regard to issues resulting from growing interdependence. On each of those two areas I wish to share some thoughts with the Assembly.The Security Council has been entrusted in the Charter with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. On the one hand we fully recognize the value of regional arrangements and initiatives for the prevention and control of conflict in various parts of the world. A recent example is the agreement signed early in August in Guatemala City during the summit conference on Central America  an agreement warmly welcomed by the Kingdom of the Netherlands. We hope that its implementation will receive support and encouragement from all quarters. On the other hand we observe that the United Nations has become a key protagonist in the search for viable solutions for the Iran-Iraq war  the occupation of Afghanistan  the Arab-Israeli conflict and the very difficult situations in Lebanon  the Western Sahara  Cyprus  Kampuchea and southern Africa. This clearly indicates the useful role of this universal Organization  in particular through the active involvement of the Security Council and the Secretary-General.The adoption by consensus of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) testified to this and marked a spirit of harmony amongst the members of the Security Council almost unthinkable two years ago. But the momentum thus created will have to be sustained. The resolution should be implemented immediately and fully. The parties involved may be expected to exercise due restraint so as to avoid escalation and expansion of the conflict. We pledge our support for the tireless efforts of Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar to terminate this tragic conflict. There are no doubt valid reasons for raising the question of the origins of the war and of culpability. However  that in no way alters the clear injunction contained in the resolution that hostilities must cease. Insisting on the termination of the war  which has caused so much human suffering and material devastation  cannot be considered as taking sides in the conflict. We want to maintain good relations with both parties. Our insistence follows from the obligation in the Charter to respect the authority of the Security Council.For centuries  freedom of navigation in international waters has been one of the basic principles of international law. Already in the seventeenth century a distinguished Dutch scholar  politician and diplomat  Hugo Grotius  applied his formidable intellectual talents to this legal principle pertaining to the high seas in his treatise Mare liberum. For the Netherlands  as a traditionally sea-faring nation  freedom of navigation is fundamental. It should be respected also in the waters of the Gulf. In our opinion the United Nations and its Member States should ensure that this now universally accepted principle is upheld. The Netherlands has made it clear that it would like to see the United Nations assume responsibility for the protection of international shipping in the Gulf and that my country would be prepared to contribute to a United Nations operation to that effect if one were to be undertaken. In the meantime  as the threat to the freedom of navigation persists  the Netherlands  after consulting with its partners in the Western European Union  has decided to participate in efforts to keep the waters of the Gulf free of mines  which we feel is to the benefit of all  but such efforts should in no way be considered as a substitute for early and full implementation of resolution 598 (1987).The efforts of the United Nations to end the war between Iran and Iraq have once again illustrated the need for an improved mechanism for fact-finding. That could greatly contribute to strengthening the role of the Secretary-General in the dispatch of his responsibilities with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security. We consider it highly desirable that the Secretary-General be provided with adequate means to increase the early-warning capacity of the Organization.We warmly welcome his endeavours and those of his Special Representative to bring to an end the continuing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The invasion of that country was brought about within a period of not more than one week. After almost eight years the time has come for a speedy and unconditional withdrawal of all Soviet troops as a prerequisite of a lasting and peaceful settlement.Kampuchea  too  still suffers under foreign occupation. We never closed our eyes to the atrocities committed in that country in the past  but they do not in any way justify the continuing occupation of that country by Vietnamese troops.Coming back to the so-welcome improvement in the East-West climate  the quest for new approaches in the Soviet Union and in the East European countries is creating prospects for a more fruitful dialogue. We should make full use of the opportunities which now appear to present themselves.After years of virtual stalemate in the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union  concrete results are now at last within reach. The agreement in principle  which I mentioned earlier  to conclude a treaty on longer- and shorter-range intermediate nuclear forces opens the way for what may well be a breakthrough of historic dimensions. This will be the first time in the nuclear era that an entire category of nuclear weapons  including some of the most modern ones  is to be abolished. We equally hope that an early agreement in this area will have a positive effect on efforts to limit strategic weapons  thus paving the way foe the 50 per cent cuts already agreed on in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union. Parallel with such substantial deductions in nuclear weapons  it should be possible to reduce nuclear testing so as to move step by step in the direction of a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. We welcome the decision of the United States and the Soviet Union to resume negotiations on that vital issue.These developments  un-thought of even a year ago  show that hope and realism do not exclude each other. Realism is necessary in other areas also. The further one progresses along the road towards reductions in nuclear weapons the more urgent it becomes to address the conventional imbalance in Europe. Here  too  stability is needed  which means eliminating asymmetries and reducing the risk of surprise attack. For that reason the 16 countries of the North Atlantic Alliance have put forward proposals for new negotiations aimed at a stable conventional balance at a lower level in the area from the Atlantic Ocean to the Urals.While it is obvious that certain categories of weapons can best be dealt with in a bilateral or regional context  others require a global and multilateral approach. Chemical weapons are a case in point. A ban on chemical weapons appears high on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament  and quite rightly so. The urgency of achieving such a ban is underlined by the actual and potential proliferation of those weapons. My country will continue to play an active part in the negotiations in Geneva  where intricate verification issues remain to be solved. Looking at the ongoing arms control and disarmament efforts in general we also note a quantum leap as a result of the growing acceptance of the need for effective verification  including on-site inspection. Here  too  we see a long period of stalemate giving way to a more constructive approach.We hope that the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament will concentrate on achieving practical progress and avoid the grand  maybe somewhat over ambitious  designs favoured in the past.Arms control agreements are essential for better East-West relations. But other elements are equally important. Genuine detente in Europe will  indeed  not materialize without greater respect for human rights in countries where these rights have long been neglected. The Helsinki Final Act  signed by 35 nations  clearly states that respect for human rights: ""is an essential factor for the peace  justice and well being necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations and co-operation among ... all States"".Accordingly  the follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) currently taking place in Vienna is addressing not only the military aspects of security but also human rights and contacts between people across dividing lines.. In Vienna my Government  together with its partners has proposed a consultative mechanism aimed at improving observance of universally accepted and recognized human rights. We deem it important that participating European countries can meet whenever one of them is seriously concerned about compliance and considers consultations necessary.Respect for human rights is a universal principle to be applied everywhere in the world. We highly value the United Nations contribution to the cause of human rights. It is out strong belief that the universal nature of these tights transcends the boundaries of national sovereignty  in our view  concern about violations can never be seen as interference in domestic affairs. Universally accepted human rights pertain by their very nature to every individual  no matter where that individual lives. Their validity is unaffected by political  socio-economic and cultural diversity. That very diversity in fact increases the need for common standards.The setting of common standards  of course  is what the United Nations and its Members have brought about. But this is  we feel  not enough. The Netherlands will  therefore  do its utmost to help strengthen mechanisms for their implementation. In this connection  I wish to mention in particular the unique system of rapporteurs of the Human Rights Commission. Moreover  we would hope that the current financial constraints of the United Nations will not diminish the effectiveness of its human rights programmes. New budget cuts in these programmes should be avoided.While dwelling on respect for human rights  let me say in conclusion that human rights and democracy cannot be seen in isolation from each other. We are therefore happy to see the restoration of democracy in certain countries of Latin America and the Caribbean  as well as in the Philippines. We should do whatever we can to ensure that democracy becomes firmly implanted in those countries and that these examples become an inspiration for others.The attention of the world community remains focused on the situation in southern Africa. Namibia's independence is long overdue. No justification can be found to postpone the day that the Namibian people can take their future into their own hands. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) should be implemented.In South Africa  every day that passes without clear signs of fundamental change adds to the feeling of frustration  despair and bitterness of those discriminated against. This does not mean  in our opinion  that we can afford to give up our hopes for a new South Africa. Change will prove inevitable  but will the course of change be marked by violence and bloodshed  or by negotiations made possible by bold initiatives which will have to create the necessary confidence that is now lacking? What has become of the South African Government's earlier expressed preparedness to embark upon a broad-based dialogue involving the representatives of all sectors of the South African people? How can this ever sound credible with Nelson Mandela and his fellow companions still in prison and prominent political groupings remaining banned?Political and economic pressure by the international community remains indispensable as long as political freedom remains the privilege of the dominating minority. But our call for justice and our deep felt abhorrence towards the system of apartheid should not be confined to condemnation  political pressure and sanctions alone.Should we not equally try to reflect on what comes after apartheid? How can a society be brought about in which all South Africans  irrespective of their race  creed or political convictions  can live in peace and harmony and enjoy equal rights? Obviously it is up to the South Africans themselves to determine the exact shape of the new constitutional order  and it is not for the outside world to present a blueprint. But we can try to encourage and facilitate a national dialogue between South Africans. And we feel that the formulation of a number of generally accepted principles may prove helpful in this respect.What is at stake in these negotiations is not only the removal of apartheid but also its replacement by a constitutional order which embodies the basic principles of freedom and pluralistic democracy and which takes into account the diversity of the South African people. Clearly  the legitimate political aspirations of the majority should be met. But is it not also tight to consider what steps should be taken to ensure that every South African can look to the future with confidence and a feeling that he will have a say in decisions which Affect him? It seems worthwhile to recall here that in paragraph 56 of its report the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group spoke about the need for ""adequate and appropriate safeguards and guarantees for minorities"" and for a ""genuine approach to power-sharing'. One can think of a number of principles which seem fundamental to a just and lasting solution  such as suffrage for all  a geographically United South Africa  a democratic and pluralistic political system with adequate minority participation  respect for human rights  protection of minorities and the rule of law  guaranteed by an independent judiciary. Such principles are closely interrelated and therefore mutually reinforcing.The raison d'etre of the United Nations does not lie only in the issues of peace  security and human rights that I have just referred to. The challenges posed by global interdependence are equally of concern to the Organization. Life on our planet is fragile and threatened by many dangers. Many developing countries are particularly vulnerable confronted as they are with an accumulation of problems  such as growing population  excessive debt and a deteriorating resource base. As is so aptly expressed in the title of the report by the Brundtland Commission  what is at stake is indeed ""Our Common Future"".The United Nations has always played a leading role in promoting awareness of global issues. Experience has shown that there are many areas in which the Organization can act as a catalyst in dealing with such problems. Action on AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)  the spread of narcotics  natural disasters : and threats to the environment can all benefit  from a really international approach. Terrorism and its toll of innocent victims cannot be condoned by the world community. It should be unequivocally condemned by all nations  whatever its motives.We applaud the outcome of the United Nations International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  held earlier this year in Vienna  which was made possible by what we see as a spirit of co-operation demonstrated by all participants. The role of the United Nations in promoting development is of particular importance. The Netherlands has always advocated better co-ordination of activities within the United Nations system and strongly supports the United Nations Development Programme. In 1988 ray country will again provide approximately 1 per cent of its gross national product  a percentage amounting to more than ÍUS 2 billion  as official development assistance. A special effort will be made in a number of countries in Central America and the Andean region  which can also help reinforce the process of democratization.Another essential role of the United Nations is in furthering the rule of law. The existing international legal framework ought to be strengthened. We should like to see more disputes submitted to the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Our common endeavours to promote development of international law have not remained without success. The law of the sea is a case in point. We hope that the recently concluded agreement on overlapping sea-bed mining claims will contribute to the establishment of a universally acceptable deep-sea-bed mining regime under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We agree with the Secretary-General on the significance of that agreement  which was based on a realistic assessment of common interests and in the conclusion of which my country actively participated.In today's interdependent world it is our common interest and our common responsibility to make this Organization work. One of the prerequisites for achieving this is respect for the principle of universality. This means that the Organization should be open to all States. We therefore hope that the Republic of Korea will shortly be represented in this forum. But more than universality alone is necessary to make the United Nations work  we feel encouraged to see a growing tendency towards reform in the United Nations. In the economic and social fields a start has been made on increasing the Organization's efficiency. Interesting proposals have been made in the relevant special commission of the Economic and Social Council. These efforts should not  however  be made dependent on the solution of the financial crisis of the Organization. An efficient United Nations is an end in itself; it should be vigorously pursued  regardless of the Organization's financial situation.May I make one final remark. It has been said that in matters of foreign policy there are two kinds of problems; those which solve themselves and those for which there is no solution. The United Nations has proved this to be wrong. In quite a few cases it has brought about solutions where none seemed possible. It has succeeded in bringing about solutions where the parties involved saw no way out. I am convinced that the United Nations is an indispensable tool for forging unity where the parties are apart. The Netherlands is determined to remain actively engaged in our common endeavours to this end."
"105",5233,"NOR",42,1987,"﻿I should like first to congratulate Ambassador Florin on his election as President of the General Assembly. I am confident that with his experience he will guide the Assembly's work to a successful conclusion. The strengthening of the United Nations is the theme of this statement.We ate meeting in the General Assembly at a time when it is more evident than ever before that the problems facing the world community can be solved only through joint international action. This is also a time of the year when we usually take stock of the state of our Organization. We do this in the knowledge that the many complimentary words uttered during the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations two years ago have been followed by an extremely difficult period for our Organization.This year we may have better opportunities than we have had for quite some time to move forward. As the Secretary-Gen et al has stated so aptly in his report  there is ""in the midst of a perilous sea  a light but favourable wind."" (P/42/1  p. 2) That wind of change became significantly stronger last week  after the historic breakthrough in the negotiations on nuclear weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union. I should like to join others in welcoming the fact that the two nations have agreed in principle to conclude a treaty on all land-based  medium-range nuclear missiles. Rather than freezing nuclear arms at existing levels  as in previous accords  the new emerging agreement will break new ground by eliminating entire categories of United States and Soviet nuclear missiles.It is our sincere hope that the impending agreement will open the way towards further progress in other critical areas of arms control and disarmament. All possible avenues should now be explored to reach agreements on strategic nuclear forces  on chemical weapons and on a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty  as well as on reductions in conventional forces. These new developments will contribute to an Improved International climate and provide the basis for the solution of the many problems on the United Nations agenda.What are the problems facing us today as Members of the United Nations? To answer that question we need look no further than to two documents now before the General Assembly: the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization and the report by the World Commission on Environment and Development  ""Our Common Future"".The Secretary-General's report gives us a lucid overview of the state of the world today. Including the many areas where armed conflicts are raging or threatening. The most burning of those issues Is the Iran-Iraq war and the spread of that conflict to the Gulf area. That war has been going on for more than seven years. It has brought untold suffering to the populations of the two countries. It threatens International shipping and the supply of oil to other nations. As Members of the United Nations  we need to make every effort to stop it  both in the interest of the two nations concerned and to maintain international peace and security. The report by the World Commission is a global agenda for change focusing on three main areas; first  it stresses the preservation of the environment  which is of vital importance not only to our own generation but also  even more  also to future ones; secondly  it highlights the inter linkage between economic growth  development and the environment} and  thirdly  it demonstrates the interdependence between nations and thus the need for strengthened multilateralism in a field where all countries - East  West  North and South - have a common interest. The report thus gives us a long-term strategy for sustainable development. It makes it very clear that there is no rational alternative to strengthened international co-operation in the interrelated issues of environment and development.Both the Secretary-General's report and the report of the World Commission point to the extremely difficult situation still facing many developing countries. The impending ecological crisis  the problems caused by drought  new epidemics and other disasters  the political and social unrest in many countries  the heavy load of the debt burden - all are problems which require both pragmatism and vision. I very much agree with the Secretary-General that we need both  that many of these problems cannot be dealt with in isolation  and that a greater understanding now seems to be emerging of the interrelationship between economic and social - and  I should like to add  ecological - problems.The States Members of the United Nations have shown repeatedly that a genuine political will to act together to solve international problems can often be found  especially in times of crisis. The individual wills of nations may not always be shared. Nevertheless  we need to ask ourselves: when there is a will  do we have the tools? How can we  the States Members of the United Nations  continue our efforts to strengthen the United Nations as the most important instrument for handling the many pressing problems facing the world community today? At the outset of the forty-first session last year  the United Nations was confronted with what is sometimes described as the worst crisis in its history. The consensus reached last year on steps to improve the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations proved  however  that the Member States could rise above their differences when the very viability of the Organization was at stake. I agree with the Secretary-General that the consensus reached last year ""could signify a historic turning point"". We now need to discuss how we can continue the reform process to increase the efficiency of the United Nations. Organizational reforms cannot be the subject of one—time decisions. A reform process must be continuous and orderly  involving both member Governments and the responsible leadership of each individual organization. The member Governments have a direct interest in the sound financial management of the Organization. At the same time we  the member Governments must  out of obligation and self-interest  respect the rights and duties of the Secretary-General as laid down in the Charter.At this point I should like to pay our compliments to the Secretary-General for his very active and constructive follow-up on the decisions taken last year. There are many interesting observations and proposals in his reports to which we will give further careful study. On this occasion I shall concentrate on four aspects.First  concerning the strengthening of the fact-finding capabilities of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat  we welcome the establishment of a separate Office for Research and the Collection of Information. The strengthening of the early-warning capability of the Organization will help to identify potentially dangerous situations before conflicts break out. This could be an important step to make the United Nations better prepared to fulfil its tasks in the maintenance of international peace and security. We hope that this will lay the foundation for an even more active role on the part of the Secretary-General and the Organization in preventing and settling disputes.Secondly  concerning the financial situation of the Organization  my Government agrees with the Secretary-General that prolongation of a situation of financial crisis will have an adverse impact on programme implementation  on orderly management and on the morale of the Secretariat staff. The financial soundness of the Organization should therefore be restored as soon as possible. That can come about only if all Member States accept the collective responsibilities inherent in the Charter of the United Nations. In this context we should perhaps examine ways and means which would make the Organization less financially dependent on any one nation or group of nations.Thirdly  concerning the related subject of the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations  those operations have long been considered to be potentially the most important and innovative contribution that the United Nations can make to maintaining world peace. The Secretary-General's report mentions several areas where such operations could make extremely important contributions - in Namibia  in Central America and in the Gulf. We also have the suggestion that peace-keeping mechanisms be used for preventive purposes. But we also know the financial problems facing present United Nations peace-keeping operations. It is becoming Increasingly difficult to find countries that are willing to provide contingents for a peace-keeping force and acceptable to the parties. I believe that new and serious thought should be given to measures which could improve the present highly unsatisfactory situation. It should not be necessary to have new crises  conflicts or wars before this problem is given serious consideration by the members of the Security Council.Fourthly  concerning follow-up on the reform process in the economic and social fields  my Government will continue to take an active part in the special commission established by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to study the intergovernmental structures and functions of the United Nations system in the economic and social fields. Like many other countries we welcome the very constructive proposal put forward by the Group of 77 at the meeting of the study group earlier this month for the strengthening of ECOSOC. We also find an interesting proposal in the Secretary-General's report on making EOOSOC a council of ministers for economic and social affairs in the world  with much more integrated responsibilities than it has today. In this connection let me even give support to the proposals to strengthen forward-looking and policy-planning functions within the Secretariat to make possible a more system-wide approach to these issues.During the last year we have made high demands of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat to implement the strict austerity measures inherent in the decisions taken last year. We  the member Governments of the United Nations  now need to consider how we may get our own act together to follow up our consensus of last year in order to give new political impetus to our Organization.One such step would be to increase the level of political participation in the meetings of the central bodies of the United Nations. Two years ago we saw the important meeting of more than 60 Heads of State or Government in New York on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Organization. We have also seen that the Security Council more and more often meets at the ministerial level when important issues are debated  the latest such occasion being during the adoption of resolution 598 (1987) on the Iran-Iraq war. We believe that this practice should be encouraged  regularized and perhaps institutionalised. In this context I also welcome the participation of Heads of State and Government at the General Assembly  I have already expressed our support for the Secretary-General's proposal to increase the level of participation in ECOSOC to that of ministers.Perhaps we could also examine more informal ways through which representatives of Member countries could meet at political levels to discuss how we could strengthen the United Nations. One way in which we could strengthen the position and the influence of the United Nations would be to make more use of the machinery provided to us by the Organization to tackle the political problems facing us.My Government will make clear its position on individual issues when the relevant agenda items are discussed later in the session. In this statement I shall concentrate on only a few issues.The finding of a solution to the conflict between Iran and Iraq and the prevention of a further escalation of the conflict should continue to be given the highest priority by the United Nations. The Norwegian Government supports Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  and we strongly appeal to the parties to respect the terms of the mandatory resolution  which was adopted unanimously by the Council  under Articles 39 and 40 of the Charter. We welcome the personal involvement of the Secretary-General to establish direct contacts with the leaders of the two parties and the report on his recent mission to the area. We would encourage him to continue his efforts to bridge the positions of the two parties. No stone should be left unturned in attempts to find a peaceful solution to this tragic conflict.We support the diplomatic efforts led by Under-Secretary-General Diego Cordovez as the best hope of reaching an early negotiated solution to the problem of the occupation of Afghanistan. We should not forget the dangers created by the lack of progress in the peace process in the Middle East. My Government supports the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations as the best way of establishing real contacts and negotiations between the parties to the conflict.In November this year it will be 10 years since the Security Council imposed a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa. The United Nations embargo needs to be implemented more strictly and to be made more comprehensive. Norway willcontinue to work with other member nations to strengthen the oil embargo. It is our view that comprehensive and mandatory sanctions adopted by the Security Council remain the most effective means to exert pressure on the South African Government.In Central America  there are encouraging signs of a momentum for peace.Norway has always supported solutions in the region  for the region and by the region. Thus  we support the peace plan adopted by the five countries of the region in Guatemala in August. We will continue to work with other nations to see if there are ways in which we can further support the peace process.While we are meeting here at the highest State and Government levels to discuss the problems of common concern it is vital to remember that the United Nations is much more than its 159 Member States. At the outset  the Charter states; ""We the peoples of the United Nations"". To fulfil the intentions behind this sentence we need also to strengthen and further develop the ties between the United Nations and non-governmental organizations.Over the past 40 years we have experienced a remarkable structural change.Much of this change has been brought about by public pressure  with people ahead of Governments. We have seen the importance of the work of non-governmental organizations in a whole range of areas  such as human rights  women's emancipation  disarmament  the North-South dialogue and environmental protection. This clearly shows that the establishment of closer links between the United Nations and non-governmental organizations is not only in the interest of the latter  but also in the interest of the Organization.My statement  as I hope the Assembly has understood  has concentrated on the situation of the United Nations solely. Representatives may ask why. The explanation is that for a country such as Norway a strong United Nations is of major importance  it actually means a strengthening of our ability to take care of our national interests.A weak United Nations means that more decisions with direct implications for our country will be taken without our participation in the decision-making process. For us  active involvement in the many activities of the United Nations in tackling the many problems facing the world is not an act of charity  it is in our own interest."
"106",5279,"NPL",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  I have the honour to convey to you and this Assembly greetings from my august sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev  and his best wishes for the success of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.On behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  I have great pleasure in congratulating you on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. This is as much a tribute to the German Democratic Republic's commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations as it is to Your Excellency's well-known personal attributes and diplomatic skill. My delegation is convinced that under your able stewardship the Assembly will achieve the desired results. I wish also to extend congratulations to Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed on his appointment as Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs.I should like to express my delegation's deep appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  who guided the General Assembly at its forty-first session with such distinction and wisdom. May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his ceaseless endeavours for the cause of international peace and co-operation as for his laudable efforts to make the United Nations system more efficient and effective.The United Nations has for some time been a helpless witness to the growing dangers and deterioration in the international situation. The spiralling arms race r in both the nuclear and the conventional fields  the ever-widening socio-economic disparities between nations and peoples  and the increasing areas or incidents of tension  intervention and conflicts present a disturbing scenario for the world as it staggers towards the twenty-first century. Clearly  this state of affairs cannot for long continue unchecked or unchallenged without inviting the most devastating consequences.It is against such a backdrop that we welcome the recent turn of events in the relations between the super-Powers. We are particularly encouraged by the agreement in principle to eliminate intermediate and short-range missiles worldwide. While such an accord in itself represents a significant achievement in the process of disarmament  we believe it could help in building mutual confidence between the super-Powers and pave the way for other  even more significant initiatives and accords. Committed as Nepal has always been to the goal of general and complete disarmament  it is only natural for us to hope that the present momentum will be maintained and that no opportunity to halt  or reverse  the arms race in other areas will be allowed to pass. While we attach the utmost urgency to nuclear disarmament because of the unlimited capacity of nuclear weapons to inflict destruction  we feel that we cannot  like Nelson  turn a blind eye and ignore the galloping conventional arms race. Such weapons consume 80 per cent of global military expenditure and have been used in over 150 conflicts in more than 70 countries since the end of the Second World War.Only a fortnight ago  the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was convened here at the United Nations. Apart from examining the close relationship between these two urgent challenges of our times  the Conference was useful in highlighting the grave dangers posed by the unprecedented arms race not only on international security but also on the stability and welfare of peoples and nations.Nepal looks forward with much anticipation to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  slated for next year. We hope that the special session will also consider new initiatives and concepts that serve to advance the cause of disarmament  including the creation of zones of peace and other confidence-building and conflict-limiting measures.In this context I wish to recall that  as early as 1975  His Majesty King Birendra proposed that Nepal be declared a zone of peace - a proposal which  I am pleased to state  has secured the valuable support of 85 States Members of the United Nations  for which I express our profound gratitude. We believe its realization would not only fully vindicate the rationale of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development but  no less important  make a tangible contribution to consolidating peace in what is a strategic part of the world. Conceivably  it could even act as a model for stabilizing peace in other geopolitically sensitive areas of the globe.An overview of the world political situation provides scant room for comfort. Thus  while the age-old predilection of the strong to impose their will on the weak continues unabated  the spectre of foreign intervention seems to have acquired subtler  and more dangerous  dimensions. If a sense of déjà vu is manifest in surveying the West Asian politico-military landscape  it is difficult to view with calm and serenity the escalation of tension in the Persian Gulf region. As we continue to remain concerned at the ongoing conflict between two of our non-aligned friends  Iran and Iraq  we have reasons to hope that the recent decision of the Security Council and the efforts of the Secretary-General will help eventually to restore peace to a region torn apart by seven long years of fratricidal conflict. Concerned at developments in Central America over the past several years  Nepal has supported the efforts of the Contadora Group for the restoration of peace.Nepal warmly welcomed the recent peace agreement signed by five Central American Presidents in Guatemala City  and we reaffirm our belief that durable peace in Central America can be established only when all States with links to or interests in the area scrupulously honour and uphold the principle of non-interference. Closer home  Nepal also welcomed the agreement between our two South Asian neighbours and friends  India and Sri Lanka  and we hope that this will not only end ethnic violence but also help in strengthening the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.Meanwhile  the depressingly familiar problems of West Asia  Afghanistan and Kampuchea are sombre reminders of how very little the world has changed in the more than four decades since the establishment of this world body  which was created  among other things  to protect the weak and uplift the poor among nations. In West Asia  prospects for a lasting peace are as bleak as ever  notwithstanding flickering hopes that a number of unyielding attitudes of the past that inhibited a comprehensive peace settlement might be shed. Peace  in our view  will continue to elude West Asia as long as the Palestinians are denied a homeland of their own in the region. There cannot be a stable peace if Israel does not withdraw from territories occupied since the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1967. Neither will peace be restored to that region as long as the right of Israel to exist within secure and well-defined boundaries is denied.The plight of Lebanon continues to be a matter of deep concern  especially that part of a sovereign State should be treated as falling within the defence perimeter of a stronger neighbour. Nepal totally rejects any doctrine or code of international ethics that is based on the absurd premise that the security of some States is more precious than that of others. Nepal is proud to participate in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon peace-keeping operations and stands ready to back any move that restores to Lebanon full sovereignty over its entire territory. We are concerned about the unsatisfactory financial situation of UNIFIL and the united Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus and emphasize the responsibility of all Member States in that respect. Nepal repeats its appeal for a peaceful settlement of the problem of Cyprus and renews its firm support for the island's territorial sovereignty  integrity  independence and non-aligned characterThe situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea are viewed with deep anxiety by Nepal. Though the past year has witnessed some new developments in the domestic situation in both of these beleaguered countries  there has been no basic shift in the prolonged presence of foreign troops. Nepal appreciates the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General and his special representative in securing a negotiated settlement - particularly in Afghanistan - where differences over the time-frame for such withdrawal have been narrowed  but not yet bridged. Nepal reiterates its resolute support for relevant General Assembly resolutions on Afghanistan and Kampuchea  including such essentials as  inter alia  withdrawal of all foreign forces and the right of the respective peoples to determine their political future without any outside interference.Nepal believes that the potentially explosive situation in Korea needs to be defused without delay. To achieve that  it welcomes any moves for greater contact and co-operation between the two Koreas. It also believes that the peaceful reunification of Korea can best be achieved by the Korean people themselves  free from any foreign interference.No review of the international situation can be objective or complete if it does not note the shameful state of affairs that exists in South Africa  where a regime of racist bigots has refined a system of ruthless exploitation against its own majority. Backed by military might  and with support from some quarters  Pretoria hurtles recklessly down the apartheid path  although there are now clear indications of doubts emerging within white South Africa itself regarding the usefulness of blindly adhering to that evil system.Nepal is honoured to serve on the Special Committee against Apartheid and reiterates its deep conviction that the application of comprehensive and mandatory economic sanctions remains the best - and perhaps the last - means of bringing about a peaceful transition to a multiracial representative society in South Africa. Nepal was pleased to make a modest contribution to the Solidarity Fund for Southern Africa set up by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the Harare Summit to provide emergency assistance to front-line and other African States to enable them to withstand the effects of retaliatory sanctions by racist Pretoria.Nepal is steadfast in its belief that any further delay in the granting of immediate and full independence to Namibia by South Africa is fraught with very grave danger to international peace and security. We applaud the heroic struggle of the Namibian people for independence under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization and reiterate our appeal to the international community to accelerate all efforts for the early implementation of the relevant Security Council and other United Nations resolutions on the granting of independence to Namibia.Nepal was pleased to participate in the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held in Vienna last June and stands fully committed to making its modest contribution to the eradication of that social scourge. I wish to state that Nepal acceded to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961  as amended by the 1972 Protocol  at the Vienna Conference. Nepal has also been actively involved in tackling this social problem at the regional level by co-operating with its South Asian neighbours.Another scourge of relatively recent origin is terrorism  to the elimination of which Nepal is equally committed along with its six other partners in the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) . I am pleased to inform you that SAARC experts have prepared a draft convention  which is to be considered by its standing committee in Kathmandu next month.I am also greatly pleased that SAARC has made further progress since I spoke here last year. At present it not only has a full-fledged secretariat  based in Kathmandu  but considerable headway has been made in developing it into an effective instrument for promoting regional co-operation for a full one-fifth of the world's population. Apart from that it is Nepal's belief that the success of SAARC can further galvanize the concept of South-South co-operation which is being promoted by  among others  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  of which Nepal is a founding member. For these reasons we in Nepal are making the necessary preparations to ensure that the next SAARC summit  to be held in Kathmandu in a few weeks  will  like the two preceding summits  achieve substantial results.The international economic situation is a depressing one  with the developingworld facing a crisis of unprecedented dimensions. This has been characterized  inter alia  by falling commodity prices  high interest rates  protectionism and a downswing of the world economy. Owing to a combination of low global growth and the increasing complexities and uncertainties of the world economy  the urgently-needed support for the development of the developing countries has failed to materialize. What has materialized instead is the grim picture of declining commodity prices  stagnating official development assistance  and the crushing burden of the external debt of developing countries. This has exacerbated political tensions. It threatens to rip open the very fabric of society of many developing countries and constitutes a threat to international peace and security. Long-term development of developing countries thus continues to be at the mercy of the inequities of a world economic system that has clearly ceased adequately to serve the objectives of global economic and social progress.While the economic situation of the developing countries as a whole is sombre enough  that in the least developed countries merits the special concern of the international community. It is with this reality in view that my delegation attaches great importance to the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which concluded its session in Geneva last month. Early this year  in Kathmandu  Nepal co-hosted  along with UNCTAD  a high-level meeting of governmental experts from 28 countries and representatives of four international organizations to discuss the problems of the least-developed countries in preparation for UNCTAD VII. My delegation shares the view of the United Nations Secretary-General that UNCTAD-VII represented an advance in the revitalization of development  growth and international trade. We believe that the political will demonstrated by all groups in reaching consensus on the final act augurs well both for the outlook for multilateral co-operation as well as for a continuing dialogue on development. In particular  my delegation is pleased that due emphasis was given to such elements as the need for sustainable non-inflationary growth in developing countries  the responsibilities of the developed countries  a new thrust to the evolution of a growth-oriented debt strategy  the potential for renewed inter-governmental co-operation in commodities and  most of all  in the reaffirmation of the urgency of more strenuous endeavours to support the development of the least developed countries. While my delegation also welcomes the acknowledgement of the complementarity between UNCTAD and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in their efforts to promote global trade  combat protectionism and reinforce the world trading system  we sincerely hope that the expectations of the least developed countries raised by UNCTAD-VII will not meet the same fate as the unfulfilled commitments made to them under the New Substantial Programme of Action for the 1980s chalked out at the Paris Conference in 1981. Nepal also believes that due priority must be given to effective implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  adopted unanimously at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly  in 1986.The speedy implementation of the New Substantial Programme of Action has special significance for Nepal which  under the wise leadership of His Majesty King Birendra  is today making all-out efforts to meet the basic needs of the people for food  shelter  clothing  primary health care  and education and security  by the end of this century. Such international assistance would be especially welcome to augment Nepal's water-resources development and the forestation efforts. Besides helping Nepal to alleviate the problem of chronic shortage of fuel  the prevention of environmental degradation of the Himalayan foothills would have a most positive impact on millions of people whose lives are greatly shaped by the rivers flowing from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal Recognizing  as Nepal does  the close interdependence of the environment and economic and social development  it most warmly welcomes the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. A significant outcome of the forty-first session of the General Assembly was the adoption of many important administrative and financial reforms designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations. We have been ' greatly encouraged by the achievements thus far and believe that the process of reforms and renewal must be carried further. However  Nepal continues to believe that unilateral withholding of dues will have grave implications not only for that process but also for the future of the United Nations and multilateralism.In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm Nepal's unwavering commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. I take this opportunity to underline Nepal's continuing support of the Non-Aligned Movement  which we maintain is as meaningful today as it was when it was founded more than a quarter century ago.I wish also to thank members of the Asian Group of the United Nations for their valuable and unanimous endorsement of Nepal's candidature for non-permanent membership in the Security Council for 1988-1989. Nepal gives its assurance that  if indeed so elected by this Assembly  it will discharge the weighty responsibilities incumbent upon such membership in a manner commensurate with the trust reposed in it. In any case  Nepal  as always  stands ready to co-operate in any endeavour that will further the lofty aims and objectives of the United Nations  convinced that it truly represents  and remains  mankind's best hope for a peaceful  prosperous and humane world.

"107",5343,"NZL",42,1987,"﻿To the representatives of the countries of the world - greetings. Bring to us from your home countries the gifts we can all share  your words of wisdom and your love. I am very happy that we have all arrived here at this gathering of world leaders. On behalf of New Zealand I add my congratulations  sir  to those of the many speakers who have preceded me on your election as President of the forty-second regular session of the General Assembly.Seven weeks ago the New Zealand Labour Government was re-elected with an increased majority. The Government was greatly encouraged by that demonstration of support from the people of our country for the policies we have pursued at home and overseas. My address today provides an opportunity for me to reaffirm the commitment of the New Zealand Government and people to the United Nations. That commitment comes from 42 years of membership of the Organization  from active participation in its work and from New Zealand's firm adherence to its ideals.In this spirit of steadfast support for the United Nations I am happy to be able to announce here that the New Zealand Government has recently reviewed its capacity to contribute to United Nations peace-keeping operations. As a result  we have decided to notify the Secretary-General of our willingness to expand our practical contribution to that most important part of the United Nations work. We have participated in United Nations peace-keeping operations in the past. At present  we provide personnel for the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) and we contribute financially to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). In future  we anticipate giving favourable consideration to requests from the Secretary-General for future involvement of New Zealand forces in peace-keeping for the United Nations. In our case  that would probably  for example  take the form of specialist teams from the New Zealand armed forces. Our broad purpose in making this commitment is to demonstrate active  practical support ; for the United Nations role of strengthening and monitoring international peace and security. Fundamentally the job of the United Nations is to preserve peace. That was why it was founded 42 years ago. That is why it remains so important in the world today· And in today's world that means that this Organization must address clearly and critically the overriding threat to international peace and security posed by the global arms race  and in particular the nuclear-arms race.New Zealand's first priority in this Assembly is to work for the achievement of urgent reductions in nuclear weapons. The ultimate goal must be a world rid of nuclear weapons; a world in which no country can claim to have to rely on nuclear weapons as the guarantor of its security.New Zealand has been greatly encouraged by recent developments in relations between the two super-Powers. Along with all other nations we welcomed their decision to agree in principle to scrap an entire class of nuclear weapons - the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) stationed in Europe and Asia. If that agreement in principle is followed  as it must be  by a treaty giving legal force to the political commitments made in Washington  it will mark a turning-point in the arms race. The INF agreement will be the first ever nuclear-arms reduction treaty. It will be testimony to the conviction that security can be maintained with fewer  not more  armaments  and that an increasing number of weapons is not necessary to preserve the peace.An INF agreement will be a welcome first step. But it is only a first step. It must be followed by measures to bring about deep reductions in strategic nuclear weapons  and by measures to prevent an arms race in outer space. Moreover  if progress is to be made on those two fronts  it will be necessary to address as a matter of priority the perceived imbalance in conventional forces and thus to achieve a balance of such forces at significantly reduced levels.President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev have themselves pointed the way. At Reykjavik last year they showed that there is no disagreement on the goals that must be achieved: a 50-per-cent reduction in strategic nuclear arsenals and  ultimately  the complete elimination o£ nuclear weapons. We urge them not to turn away from those objectives  not to turn away from the vision we saw from Reykjavik of a world without nuclear weapons. That vision will not be realized this year  perhaps not even this century. Yet it is an objective in the achievement of which every country in the Assembly has a direct and vital interest.The immediate challenge is to find ways of working towards that goal while at the same time maintaining the security of every State and region.New Zealand has long held that concluding a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is one important way to do that. In the resolutions that we  together with Australia and a number of other countries  have put before the Assembly  we have urged the international community to seize on the central means of putting a brake on the nuclear-arms race. While we have welcomed  therefore  the recent agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to begin stage-by stage negotiations on nuclear testing  we would nevertheless still urge the participants to see that those negotiations are more closely linked to the objective the Assembly has reiterated for so many years - an end to all nuclear testing by all States in all environments for all time. We will again be putting a resolution on nuclear testing before the First Committee of the Assembly. We will be calling on the Conference on Disarmament to break the impasse which has strangled effective multilateral consideration of this issue for the past five years.Another issue which the multilateral disarmament process has so far failed to address adequately is the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Three years ago my Prime Minister David Lange noted from this rostrum the disquieting indications that the military competition between the two super-Powers might be moving into the new environment of outer space. Developments since that time have done little to allay our concern. New Zealand is unequivocally opposed to the extension of the arms race into outer space. We will be following closely the deliberations at the Conference on Disarmament on this subject next year and at the third special session of this Assembly on disarmament  where it can be expected to receive considerable attention.However  there have been some notable achievements this year. Progress has been made at the Geneva negotiations on a convention to eliminate chemical weapons - some of the most barbaric instruments of war  the use of which we unequivocally condemn. We look forward to the early completion of that most urgent work. In addition  the successful conclusion o£ the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which I was privileged to address just over a month ago  should have restored some faith in multilateralism. The consensus achieved at that Conference is all the more significant when considered against the pessimism that marked its preparatory process. It should encourage us as we prepare for the third special session on disarmament next year. As a smaller nation with little power to influence the great nuclear-weapon States  We simply make a plea  an impassioned plea  to our brothers and sisters that have that power. We are now at a historic turning-point in the modern era. Having gone steadily forward in preparation for defence or conflict since men first formed groups and alliances  we have come to the brink. We  most of us  want to turn back. But there are still abroad fears that those whom we have not learned to knew or to trust will keep pressing ahead  that to proceed with disarming will undermine our own security. Learning to trust each other enough  learning to tone down the rhetoric we use against each other/ is now fundamental to the steps we need to take to enable this small  delicate planet and its people to survive.That is why my country is so determined to see progress towards disarmament. The stakes are enormous. While the arms race continues in its nuclear and conventional dimensions  the security of each of us is at risk. New Zealanders do not expect others to act while we do nothing ourselves. Equally  we do not tell others how to resolve the particular security imperatives of their region as they seek to give substance to the principles of the Charter and to the international community's desire for a safer  less militarised world.At home my Government has enacted legislation to ensure that New Zealand remains nuclear free. With our partners in the South Pacific Forum we have made a contribution to the security of our region through the adoption and entry into force of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. That Treaty reinforces the non-proliferation undertakings already given by nearly all Forum countries through our adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It gives expression to the unanimous desire of all the independent and self-governing States of our region that our part of the world should not be used as a testing ground for nuclear weapons or a dumping ground for nuclear waste. For the zone established by the Treaty to be truly effective  however  we rely on the nuclear-weapon States to commit themselves unreservedly to respecting its provisions. It is our earnest hope that all five nuclear—weapon States will demonstrate respect for the wishes of South Pacific States by adhering to the protocols to the Treaty. It is our particular hope that France will demonstrate its understanding of the sensitivities of our region  the region in which it seeks to be a partner  by putting an end to its nuclear-testing programme in the South Pacific.The control and reduction of armaments may help to maintain international security. It is the use of arms that destroys it. The Charter accordingly imposes an obligation on all States to settle their differences by negotiation and not to go to war. In the Security Council the Charter created the means by which the United Nations could uphold the rule of law and work for the peaceful settlement of disputes and the ending of conflict. The Council's record is far from unblemished we believe that its performance could be improved if its members could co-operate to settle disputes before the parties turn to conflict and its decisions might be less often disregarded or defied if the policies and actions of the great Powers showed greater respect for the laws they enjoin others to follow.New Zealand welcomes the rare unanimous decision by the Security Council to seek an end to the war between Iran and Iraq. We regret only that the conflict was allowed to continue for seven years before the Council intervened to fulfil the role assigned to it by the Charter. The Secretary-General may be assured of our full support in his patient efforts  on behalf of the Council and with the trust of both parties  to settle the conflict in accordance with resolution 598 (1987). It is to his office  too  that we look for assistance in ending the aggression against the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea  which has continued year after year regardless of the wishes and condemnation of the General Assembly. Political settlements in both countries and the withdrawal of foreign forces from them are long overdue. In Korea  the armed confrontation still continues after more than three decades. The absence of Korean representation is a major gap in the universality of the United Nations. New Zealand shares the widespread view that the two Koreas should be admitted as Members of the United Nations as soon as possible and should pursue their negotiations towards reconciliation and  if possible  national reunification.Pew situations have preoccupied the United Nations longer than the South African Government's racist practices  its illegal occupation of Namibia and its policies of destabilization in the region. Like those of the Commonwealth Group which last year sought to initiate a dialogue between the Government and genuine representatives of the black community  mediation efforts by the United Nations have come to nothing. The South African Government equates justice with white supremacy and right with the forces at its disposal. Its armies have marched in territories of neighbouring States. Its police have detained both black leaders and children looking for something better than education for a life of subjection. For our part we have given effect to the measures against South Africa recommended by the Commonwealth to impress on the authorities in Pretoria the urgency of dismantling apartheid. But  sadly  I have to say that  in the absence of effective action by more countries or a firm response to the threat by the Security Council  I see little prospect that the South African Government will depart from its determination not to reject apartheid  but to tinker with it  at its own pace and in its own time.Apartheid is a most brutal manifestation of racism and disregard of human rights. It is not  however  the only such manifestation. We all know too well the many abuses of human rights that occur in various countries represented in this body. The United Nations has done much valuable work in codifying universal standards of respect for human rights. We must ensure that this work continues and that the standards already set are fully respected.Abuses of human rights are a direct attack on the integrity of the individual. Terrorism strikes at the integrity of the community. It kills the innocent and cruelly disrupts the normal operations of society. It is also a threat to world peace. An important task at this session will be to build on the achievement of resolution 40/61 and thereby encourage the adoption of practical measures to deal with international terrorism. Another item of importance to New Zealand is that on Antarctica  an issue that has been on the Assembly's agenda since 1983. New Zealand is firmly committed to maintaining the Antarctic Treaty which has preserved the peace and stability of the region to our south over the past 27 years. We hope that the Assembly's deliberations on Antarctica at this session will bring further understanding and support for the Treaty  which any Member of the Organization is free to join.Events in Fiji show that the South Pacific is not immune from turmoil or change. For New Zealand - a close friend and neighbour - these events have been a matter of very great sadness. Since the time of the first coup New Zealand has steadfastly supported the efforts of Fiji's Governor-General to return the country to parliamentary rule·  we continue to regard him as the legitimate source of authority in Fiji. It follows that New Zealand does not recognize the legality of Colonel Rabuka's self-declared republic. Even at this late stage we hope that the people of Fiji will pull back and insist that their leaders find a just political solution which takes account of the interests of all. New Zealand trusts that the Governor-General will hold fast to the principles of legitimacy which have guided him thus far. We very much hope that no constitution will be adopted that would make Fiji Indians second class citizens in their own country. We want to see Fiji regain its rightful position in the Pacific region and on the wider world stage. Like all its neighbours New Zealand wants to see Fiji strengthened by a reassertion of its traditions of tolerance and good sense  playing an active part in the peaceful development of the South Pacific. Failure to achieve a solution would be a major set-back  not only for Fiji but for the entire South Pacific region.Fiji's crisis is a recent development. We have  however  been concerned for some time at the dangers inherent in the situation in our closest neighbour New Caledonia if the natural progress of that Territory to self-determination is frustrated. At the initiative of the countries of the South Pacific Forum  the General Assembly last year resolved that New Caledonia was a Non-Self-Governing Territory within the meaning of the United Nations Charter. Forum countries sought to have New Caledonia re-inscribed on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories because of their wish to see a more constructive approach by the administering Power. Present policies serve to exacerbate divisions within the Territory and appear likely to frustrate movement towards independence.My Government believes that France has a continuing role to play in the South Pacific region. But that will require a far-sighted approach to resolving the problems of New Caledonia and a sensitivity to the views and feelings of the peoples of the region. We have watched with genuine regret what has appeared to us to be a policy that does not take sufficient account of long-term concerns and solutions  bringing with it the prospect of more confrontation and division within New Caledonia.Since last year's vote  France has promoted a referendum in New Caledonia  an exercise which in our view has not helped the political process there and about which  as we know from the debate which surrounded the passage of the referendum legislation through the French Parliament earlier this year  there are considerable doubts in France itself. A referendum which did not offer the full range of choices prescribed by United Nations practices and guidelines is deficient. It cannot be regarded as a free choice when the administering Power is committed to promoting one particular choice and the forces of government are directed to that end. A process of preparation during which options were not fully presented and were not adequately explained is a further serious deficiency. A period of preparation in which there was only circumscribed dialogue within the Territory and throughout which there was a strong military presence  is no atmosphere for free and impartial consideration of New Caledonia's long-term future. In short  a political consultation that forced a substantial sector of the community to repudiate the very process  is inherently flawed. It is not a valid act of s el f -determination.I appeal to the French Government to resume contact with all interested parties in New Caledonia  to accept the offer of dialogue which the South Pacific Forum has made and to involve the United Nations in the political process that is to take place in New Caledonia.Elsewhere in the South Pacific the United Nations has played a valuable role in the decolonization process as Non-Self-Governing Territories have moved to self-government or to independence in accordance with United Nations principles and practices. For this reason my Government urges strong support for the moderate  principled and constructive resolution on New Caledonia which will be taken up in the Fourth Committee at this session of the Assembly.For the most part the decolonization process in the Pacific has been peaceful and has laid the basis for good regional co-operation. That tradition has been continued this year with the proclamation of the Compacts of Free Association of ' the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. New Zealand welcomes them as new members of the South Pacific Forum. We look forward to increasing contacts with the Micronesian Governments in the years to come and to the fulfilment of the United Nations role in the Trust Territory of the Pacific.Political security must be reinforced by economic security. Not only in the South Pacific  but throughout the world  the effect of low commodity prices is having a serious effect. Growth in developing countries is expected to average only 4 per cent in 1987  half the average of the 1960s and 1970s. Hardest hit is the agricultural sector which  in low-income developing countries  employs 70 to 80 per cent of the population.Yet the undisciplined nature of world agricultural trade means that countries with a comparative advantage in agriculture have to compete for markets with subsidized exports that distort prices. The twin spectres of surpluses and starvation are an economic and moral outrage that cannot be allowed to continue  a contradiction which we must find ways to remove.At its seventh session  the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development noted that while many countries  developed and developing  are adjusting their economies  much remained to be done to reduce or eliminate ""growth retarding distortions and rigidities"". The positive forward-thinking spirit that marked that session should guide us in our efforts towards the elimination of trade-distorting measures. Crucial to these efforts are the negotiations currently under way in the Uruguay round. If we really believe in having a healthy international economy  contributing to world peace  we must ensure that these negotiations succeed.As we work to improve the functioning of the system of international relations we must also work to improve the functioning of the institution that underpins so much of the system. Last year's financial crisis made clear that we  the membership  had failed to ensure that this Organization remained responsive to changing demands and circumstances. The financial crisis itself was precipitated by a failure on the part of some of the Members to fulfil their Charter commitments. It served to highlight  however  a more long-standing failure of the collective membership and of the institution to ensure the continuing revitalization of the Organization.	.Every institution  no matter how noble its goals  needs to undertake from time to time a thorough-going reappraisal of its structures and procedures. In recognition of this need  for instance  my Government is in the process of carrying out a far-reaching reform of the functioning of government in New Zealand. The United Nations is no different. It needs to change with the times.From the work of the past year a number of studies and reforms are under way. They must be pursued to their conclusion. The financial crisis may have abated to a degree: the need for change has not. One of the areas to which my Government will pay particular attention is the review of management of the United Nations development effort to be undertaken by the Economic and Social Council over the next year. The United Nations and its agencies have a unique role to play in development assistance  particularly in areas such as the establishment of development planning mechanisms and negotiations by Governments with trans national corporations. But such assistance must be appropriate and effective. The special needs of the isolated island developing nations of the South Pacific are often inadequately met by structures and rules which have been set up to cover large continental recipients in other regions. Any decisions taken on the spot in the South Pacific by a more coherent United Nations presence would reflect more truly the South Pacific realities than decisions taken in places such as Geneva  New York or Bangkok. I offer those remarks not as the representative of a country that is critical of or disenchanted with the United Nations. Quite the reverse: as 1 said at the beginning  the New Zealand Government and people are firm supporters of the United Nations. We shall remain so. But we would be bad friends of the Organization if we failed to encourage it to change where change is necessary. The process of change is under way. Let us keep up the momentum  and let us get the balance right. I end as I began  drawing on the wisdom of the Maori people of New Zealand. There is a Maori saying which goes ""A warrior who works hard at growing food will not fail"".That expresses in a nutshell what this Organization is all about. We must be firm in our resolve to retain the peace  but must look also to improving the lot of all our peoples. Getting the balance right is an international imperative."
"108",5388,"OMN",42,1987,"﻿I should like at the outset  Sir  to congratulate you on your assumption of the office of President of the General Assembly. I am confident that your experience and skill in various fields will be positive factors that will help to ensure the success of this session. I emphasize the readiness of my Government and delegation to co-operate with you and with the other members of the General Committee.I take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  on the exemplary manner in which he conducted the business of the forty-first session. I wish also to express our pleasure at the re-election of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to a second term of office. That election demonstrates the extent of the international community's confidence in the Secretary-General as he administers the affairs of this world Organization.Since its inception the United Nations has not ceased to make every effort to contain each crisis as soon as it has arisen. If the United Nations has not yet been able to establish an international order free of the scourges of war  hunger and disease  as desired by the nations and peoples  that is not because of any lack of resolutions or instruments that have received the approval of States  any defect in the legal framework of the Organization or any lack of clarity in its purposes ' and principles. The most pressing need of the Organization is for faith in those purposes and principles and beneficial co-operation among peoples in the interest of all. The United Nations represents the best means through which to ensure peace  security and international co-operation. In the light of the heightened tension at both the regional and the international level  there is an increasingly urgent need for the United Nations to continue to play a leading role in the resolution of disputes and in arriving at peaceful solutions and settlements.We are encouraged by the emerging signs of a possible historic agreement between the nuclear-weapon States to banish the spectre of the nuclear threat that has haunted our international community for decades. Liberation from the nuclear arms race would release enormous facilities and resources with which the International community could arm itself in its campaign against disease  hunger and poverty. It would also reduce existing tensions and restore tranquillity to international relations.As positive signs emerge which promise the establishment of a better climate in relations between the two super-Powers  we hope that advantage will be taken of this climate to give greater  more vigorous and more effective momentum to efforts to solve problems that continue to threaten security and peace.The international community has expressed its hope that a solution will be found to the war between Iraq and Iran  which has consumed more material and human resources than either of those States can afford. Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which received the approval of all the members of the Council  indicates that the right kind of action is being taken to address that conflict. The aim of that Security Council resolutions as we see it  is to bring about peace  harmony and co-operation between Iraq and Iran. Any subsequent steps taken by the Security Council to achieve that aim must be fully justifiable and must not take the form of measures that do not provide an appropriate climate for the achievement of lasting peace. We believe that the United Nations must take measures that inspire a sense of justice and fairness on the part of both parties to the conflict  as that would encourage all concerned to co-operate with the Secretary-General in his peace-making efforts. We in the Gulf are experiencing an extremely difficult and dangerous crisis and we are anxious to see practical solutions to this problem - not solutions designed to complicate and escalate the crisis  but solutions designed to calm the situation and bring about peace.The Sultanate of Oman appreciates and understands the anxiety and concern of the international community regarding the safety of shipping in the Gulf. It recognizes the right of all the Gulf States to ensure the freedom and safety of shipping to and from their ports. Attacks on shipping in the Gulf cannot be justified; they constitute a danger to the interests of all the Gulf States. They also undermine the moat basic principles and laws of international shipping. The Sultanate of Oman! affirms once again that in fulfilling its national and international responsibilities in regulating shipping in the waterways of the Strait of Hormuz  it adheres to the regulations laid down in the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the rules and regulations on maritime safety adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)  It calls on all States whose ships pass through the Strait of Hormuz to abide by those rules and regulations.The Western States are making every effort to clear the mines which threaten the safety of shipping in the Gulf. Those efforts will be helpful so long as their action remains within a peaceful context and outside the regional conflict. In the long term the protection of shipping in the Gulf's international waters must be regulated in accordance with United Nations principles and within a framework of joint action and international legality  since this will prevent the extremely sensitive Gulf region from being converted into an arena of conflict between international Powers with apposing interests.The Sultanate of Oman's position on the question of the conflict between Iraq   and Iran is clear and unequivocal. Our objective is peace and stability in the region as a whole. Ours is a State which has close ties to and shared interests with all States in the region. We cannot play a positive role in finding a solution to the current dispute in such as way as to serve the overall interests of the region other than through co-operation with both patties to the conflict. The ties which link us to both the Republic of Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran are ties of religion  good-neighbourliness  history and shared interests in the promotion of those ties would cement co-operation and stability in the region. In our view of our close links with both sister States and by virtue of our location in the Gulf  we have to make every effort to find appropriate solutions with a view to bringing about and ensuring peace and stability  restoring the spirit of co-operation between the Iraqi and Iranian peoples and involving them in the co-operation between all the peoples of the Gulf.Among the issues which continue to threaten security and cause concern to the international community is the question of Palestine  which is the core of the Middle East problem. We welcome the trends and signs that herald the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and to be attended by all the parties concerned. Once again we urge those States which have close ties with Israel to use their influence to eliminate all the obstacles that still prevent the convening of the desired conference. In so urging and in giving our support to the convening of the international conference  we express the hope that it will provide an effective means through which to attain positive results.The Palestinian people  whose homeland continues to be subject to Israeli occupation  continues to have great hope that this conference will enable them to regain its legitimate rights  including its right to self-determination in its own homeland and territory. All the peoples of the region want that conference to lead to a just  honourable and lasting peace. The present circumstances  in which all the parties to the Middle East conflict recognize the importance of peace  provide a significant opportunity which must not be missed. This is the first such opportunity since the conflict began. If it is not seized  the future may not afford any further opportunities for peace in the Middle East  which is one of the most sensitive and dangerous areas in the world. Any future move to abandon the realms of peace would expose the security of the whole world to the dangers of a destructive war. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General  through his Personal Representative  Mr. Diego Cocdovez  to find a peaceful solution to the problem of Afghanistan and express our support for the position of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on this issue. We urge that further# rapid progress be made in the ongoing talks between the parties concerned  under the auspices of the United Nations  in order that the Muslim people of Afghanistan may attain their right to live in peace in their homeland under a system of government of their own choice  without any interference in their internal affairs. We believe that the eight-point proposal adopted by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea on 17 March 1986 may serve as a basis for the solution of the Kampuchean problem. In this connection  we cannot fail to commend the efforts to solve it made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)   particularly the praiseworthy efforts of Mr. Mochtar Kusumaatmadja  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia  on behalf of the States of the Association  to promote the peace process with regard to this problem. It is our hope that these efforts will be heeded by Viet Nam and all the other parties directly concerned so that the Kampuchean people may themselves choose the system of government which they consider appropriate. The unstable state of the relations between North and South Korea is a factor which creates instability in the Korean peninsula. Peaceful dialogue between the two Koreas is the only means whereby the points of view of the two States may be reconciled. The admission of both North and South Korea as Members of the United Nations would provide a better climate in which to strengthen and expand peaceful dialogue between the two countries  leading to a reduction in the level of tension in the region. The Sultanate of Oman  believing as it does in the international character of the United Nations  would welcome any international effort to admit the two Korean States to membership of the Organization .The fact that economic  political and social justice has not been achieved in South Africa is a threat to peace and stability in the whole region of southern Africa and  furthermore  a major challenge to the will of the international community. The deterioration of the political and social situation in southern Africa is an inevitable and direct result of the policy pursued by the Government of South Africa  which casts aside the most basic rules of human behaviour. We condemn the arbitrary measures taken by the Government of South Africa against the black majority and cannot help but join with those who call for the immediate Independence of Namibia through the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). South Africa's prolongation of its military occupation of Namibia and its stubborn adherence to the system of racial discrimination will only lead to the shedding of more blood and the undermining of security and stability in that important part of the world.The Sultanate of Oman  In an effort to maintain equilibrium in the region in which we live and to keep that region free from super-Power rivalry  has repeatedly called for the speedy implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  of 1971. Developments in that region show that implementation of the Declaration would be a major step towards the establishment of international peace and security. There can be no doubt that the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean is long overdue and that it must take place in order that the essence of the Declaration may become the practice. We regret that the Conference has been postponed once again and hope that the resolution of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  adopted by consensus at its last session and calling for the Conference to be convened not later than 1990  will constitute a final decision.The crisis in Central America has an effect on the harmony among  and the security and stability of  all the peoples in the region. The peace plan adopted   by the Central American Heads of State is an appropriate and significant step in :  the region's peace process. It strengthens and complements the continuing peace efforts of the Contadora Group. We hope that the agreement will mean the beginning of peace and stability for the peoples of the region.Encouraging signs of accord are emerging. It appears that the two super-Powers are about to take decisions to eliminate their nuclear stock piles from Europe. This agreement will certainly be of major importance since it will lead to the mutual withdrawal and destruction  for the first time  of operational weapons systems. Another of the most significant results of the agreement is the mutual feeling of emerging trust between the two States and of the need for such an agreement. We hope that any agreement on medium-range nuclear weapons will constitute not an end in Itself but a step towards a comprehensive programme of disarmament and the total elimination of all nuclear weapons.We take advantage of this opportunity to express our satisfaction at and support for the results of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  held in New York from 24 August to 11 September 1987. We believe that the convening of this Conference - the first such under United Nations auspices - strengthens the confidence of the international community in this Organization  increases integration among nations and boosts solidarity in the solution of international problems.During the 1980s the world economy has undergone structural changes which have had long-term effects on the economies of all States  industrialized and developing alike. Among the main reasons for these numerous changes we cite technological advances  the increasing internationalisation of commercial and financial markets  and the overall economic policies of the major industrialized States  in particular. These changes have had negative effects on growth and development performance in the world in general and developing countries in particular.The world is at present passing through a severe economic crisis  the most evident manifestations of which are the collapse of prices of commodities; the deterioration in the terms of trade  to the detriment of the interests of those States which produce such commodities; the worsening of the debt crisis; the further proliferation of protectionist tendencies; the instability of exchange rates for major currencies; and a marked reduction of economic growth in  the developing countries. All this is accompanied by a slowing down of world economic growth and a decline in the average real per capita income in developing countries. If the affluent countries permit these policies to continue it will mean the developing countries will return to a state of backwardness and poverty and be denied the opportunity to achieve higher levels of growth and revive their economies.Opposition to increasing commodity prices  including the price of oil  on an equitable basis with the prices of industrial products will undoubtedly have negative consequences for the economic performance of developing countries and create new complications in the problem of the third-world debt. We call for a genuine reform of the balance of payments and terms of trade  on the basis of justice and balance  to serve the interests of both sides. We reaffirm the importance of the resumption of a serious and constructive dialogue between the nations of the North and the South in order to achieve this objective.The need for a world in which justice and peace prevail among all nations  regardless of size or economic  military or political strength  is today greater  than ever. We firmly believe that the United Nations is the structure within which that objective must be achieved. For that reason we must make greater efforts to strengthen the functioning of the United Nations and increase its effectiveness in maintaining international peace and security. This can be done only if Member States play the role they are called upon to play in promoting the Organization by adhering to its Charter  in order that the Organization may attain its noble κ purposes and preserve its achievements.

"109",5434,"PAK",42,1987,"﻿I am deeply conscious of the privilege I have today of addressing the forty-second session of the General Assembly and welcome this opportunity to bring to the Assembly the greetings of the Government and people of Pakistan  a country whose faith in the United Nations has never faltered and whose commitment to the purposes and principles of its Charter has never wavered. I have the honour of reaffirming that faith and renewing that commitment from this rostrum·I have great pleasure in extending to you  Mr. President  our warm felicitations on your election to the presidency of this important session of the General Assembly* You represent a country with which Pakistan has excellent relations. The exemplary progress achieved by the German Democratic Republic in all fields of national endeavour is a tribute to the quality and dedication of its leadership and the industry of its gifted people. We feel confident that with your great experience and diplomatic skills you will successfully guide the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly.I should also like to congratulate our brother  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  on the distinction with which he presided over the last session of the General Assembly. His outstanding performance was a legitimate source of pride for the Government and people of Bangladesh and  indeed  for Pakistan  which nourishes abiding goodwill and affection for Bangladesh.It gives me special pleasure to avail myself of this opportunity of expressing to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  my profound admiration for the sagacious manner in which he steered the United Nations through times most testing for the Organization and its Member States. We has just returned from a difficult mission to two countries locked in a tragic fratricidal conflict. We are conscious of the strains which his awesome responsibilities impose upon him and assure him of our fullest co-operation and maximum support in the fulfilment of the stupendous task before him.Pakistan is a young country  but it is steeped in history and heir to a proud tradition. It embodies the hopes and aspirations of 100 million people who carved out a national home for themselves after immense sacrifices. In their march towards freedom  independence and a democratic system of government the people of Pakistan have waged a long and hard struggle. I am deeply conscious of the honour of speaking for such a country as the Prime Minister of its elected Government.Pakistan was born in a hostile environment. It faced internal difficulties and external dangers of a magnitude such as might have smothered it in its infancy. The inherent strength of the ideology on which it was founded  the faith and dedication of the people and the example of its founding father Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah  ensured its survival and steered it safely through the most difficult period of its existence.Democratic institutions are shaped by a nation's political and cultural ethos  in Pakistan the democratic process has been deeply influenced and enriched by the pervasive egalitarian spirit of Islam.We are not only resolved to consolidate and strengthen the democratic process  it is out endeavour to free our people from the spectre of want  hunger and deprivation. Last year I initiated a five-point programme of socio-economic reforms encompassing bold and determined action to promote literacy  provide shelter to the homeless and eradicate inequality  rural backwardness and poverty. We hope to be able to achieve the broad objectives of this programme within the next three years. Last month we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of Pakistan's birth. The day after we achieved independence our founder  Quaid-e-Azam  proclaimed the following goals of our foreign policy;""We want to live peacefully and maintain cordial and friendly relations without immediate neighbours and with the world at large. We have no aggressive designs against anyone. We stand by the United Nations Charter and will gladly make our full contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world."" Our commitment to the ideals of the United Nations is embodied in our approach to every global and regional issue. Born to freedom by the exercise of the right of self-determination  Pakistan joined the battle against colonialism from its very infancy. We cannot forget those who have yet to win freedom. To them I pledge Pakistan's unflinching support in their struggle to achieve national independence and sovereignty.The tragedy of Palestine is ever fresh in our minds. We share the pains and anguish of generation after generation of Palestinians who have been banished from their homeland and condemned to a desperate existence- This year in particular has a unique significance for the Palestinian people. Seventy years ago  the Balfour Declaration sowed the seeds of the Palestinian problem. Forty years ago the Palestinian homeland was forcibly rent asunder. Twenty years ago the remaining territory of Palestine was occupied by Israel.A peace settlement in the Middle East will be durable only if it is just and comprehensive; if it brings about Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Al-Quds-al-Sharif; and if it enables the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and statehood in their homeland.It is my fervent hope that a consensus will soon be achieved to convene an international conference to negotiate a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. The Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  must be enabled to participate on an equal footing in that conference.Apartheid is a cruel and perverse creed  repugnant to the laws of God and a crime against the laws of nations. Many nations  including my own  maintain a stringent and comprehensive boycott of the racist regime in Pretoria. We appeal to the international community to agree to the imposition of mandatory sanctions against the perpetrators of apartheid.The hour of decision is fast approaching. The oppressed people of South Africa have risen to defend their dignity. They have been subjected to untold misery and undergone great sacrifices. Common humanity entitles them to the political and material support of the world community. Pakistan will stand by the embattled people of South Africa until the pernicious system of apartheid has been dismantled and racial discrimination and domination have been demolished.I pray that Namibia will soon win its freedom. The demand for implementation of the plan for Namibia's independence  agreed on since 1978  cannot be resisted indefinitely. The right of a people to self-determination cannot be held hostage to global power politics. The freedom of Namibia cannot be made dependent on developments in neighbouring Angola. My Government has extended full recognition to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and I assure it of Pakistan's unswerving support in its heroic struggle for liberty and independence.In Afghanistan foreign military intervention represents an attempt to reverse the tide of history. A country that was historically independent  a founding Member of the United Nations  was overrun eight years ago. Its sovereignty was usurped its land desecrated.No objective observer can deny that the intervention of the Soviet Union's forces in Afghanistan violated the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter; that the people of Afghanistan are waging a legitimate struggle for national liberation and self-determination; that the presence of Soviet forces in Afghanistan poses a direct threat to the security and stability of the entire region; and that  unless reversed  this intervention could set a dangerous precedent  giving encouragement to the forces of aggression and to the revival of the era of darkness and domination.Pakistan has provided shelter and relief to over 3 million refugees from Afghanistan as our Islamic and humanitarian obligation to our neighbours. We could not have carried this burden alone. I should like to express our gratitude to all those who have joined the international effort to bring relief to this  the largest refugee concentration in the world.The General Assembly has adopted a clear and unambiguous stand. It has called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces  the restoration of the independent and non-aligned status of Afghanistan  respect for self-determination and the return of the Afghan refugees to their homes in safety and honour. The Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and other international organizations have endorsed those principles. After eight years of the war in Afghanistan  it is clear that military force can never suppress the valiant Afghan struggle for national liberation. The situation in Afghanistan can be resolved only through a political settlement. Pakistan has participated constructively in the Geneva proximity talks  under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez. The comprehensive settlement being negotiated through the Geneva process is virtually complete. The principal missing element is the provision of a time-frame for the withdrawal of the Soviet forces.The demand for a short time-frame for the withdrawal of foreign troops is based on the decision of this Assembly. It also flows from the purpose and spirit of the settlement under negotiation. Its logic is irrefutable. Once a political settlement is reached under the Geneva Accords the Soviet forces must immediately abandon the military option. The insistence on an extended time-frame for troop withdrawal arouses legitimate suspicion of a lurking desire to pursue the military option to crush the Afghan resistance even after a settlement has been signed.Nor can the demand for ""national reconciliation"" be made a pre-condition for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. The Afghan resistance has rejected the proposal  because ""national reconciliation"" under foreign occupation would  by definition  be hollow and transitory. A people's right to self-determination cannot be exercised freely in the shadow of a foreign army.The crux of the problem in Afghanistan is the presence of foreign forces. Throughout the history of Afghanistan  divisions among its people have arisen only when imperialist Powers have intervened in its internal affairs. Left to themselves  the Afghan people have always found a way to reconcile their differences. Once foreign forces leave Afghanistan  agreement on its future governance will be speedily achieved. Indeed  a short time—frame for Soviet withdrawal would encourage all the Afghans to reach agreement on the way in which they wish to govern themselves.Pakistan would welcome the return of normalcy in Afghanistan under any political arrangement acceptable to the Afghan people  including the five million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran  who constitute one third of the population of Afghanistan.Contrary to our hopes and expectations  the favourable trends evident early in the year appear to have come to a stop. The military operations inside Afghanistan have been intensified. There have been heavy casualties on both sides. The outcome  again  is a stalemate. Refugees from Afghanistan have continued to flow into Pakistan  this year at the rate of 4 000 to 5 000 every month. Pakistan has also been subjected to repeated aerial attacks and a systematic campaign of terrorist bomb explosions in the crowded bazaars of its cities. Hundreds of innocent men  women and children have been killed or maimed.I may warn those responsible for these crimes that  while we are most anxious to achieve a political settlement  we will not falter in our resolve  nor submit to pressure.The absence of a positive response from Kabul has stalled the Geneva proximity talks since March this year  then  a few weeks ago  Kabul suddenly asked for a new round of talks. Pakistan promptly agreed and the talks were held from 7 to 10 September. We shared a legitimate international expectation that Kabul would come forward with a reasonable time-frame. I sent the Foreign Minister of Pakistan to Geneva with instructions to respond positively to a genuine offer of a short time-frame for Soviet troop withdrawals.I must confess I was deeply disappointed by what transpired in Geneva. Kabul's representatives continued to insist on an unreasonable and lengthy period for foreign troop withdrawal. Consequently  the talks proved inconclusive. The conclusion is inescapable that Kabul's initiative for this last round was not motivated by a desire to reach a settlement. Its target was this Assembly  whose members  I am aware  have been deluged with false propaganda about the so-called national reconciliation programme and the imminence of the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.This Assembly  I am confident  will reconfirm its principled position on Afghanistan  By its consistent demand for the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces  the world community has contributed immensely to bringing closer the day when a just and lasting settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan will be achieved. The Soviet Union is Pakistan's neighbour. My Government seeks to promote friendly and co-operative relations with the Soviet Union  despite our differences over Afghanistan. From this rostrum  I fervently appeal to General Secretary Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership to help resolve the tragic situation in Afghanistan on the basis of justice and equity. I assure the Soviet leadership of Pakistan's fullest co-operation.By agreeing to the early withdrawal of its forces the Soviet Union would regain the good will of the Afghan people and earn the gratitude and appreciation of the Members of the United Nations. The withdrawal of Soviet troops would also contribute to the improvement of the global security environment  which is consistent with Mr. Gorbachev's noble vision of a new and peaceful world - a vision which I fully share  and which Pakistan would wish to see translated into reality.The Kampuchean problem  too  is also the result of foreign military intervention. It is particularly distressing that this iniquity should have been perpetrated by a country which had suffered the long rigour of foreign domination. We urge an early end to the occupation of Kampuchea.Pakistan cannot be tranquil while the Gulf is in turmoil. The tragic war between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq has entered its eighth year. This war has resulted in a colossal loss of life and caused immense destruction in both countries. Its tensions have already gripped the entire Gulf region.Since the war began we have made sustained efforts to bring it to an end. During the past tense months we have counselled caution and restraint to all the parties concerned. The growing involvement of the great Powers in the Gulf carries grave portents. The Third Islamic Summit  held in Taif in Saudi Arabia  declared that the security of the Gulf was the responsibility of the States of the Gulf themselves. Observance of this principle can help defuse the current confrontation and rebuild peace in the region. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) contains the elements which can serve to end the war and to ease current tensions. Following the Secretary-General's recent visit to the region  we are today closer than ever before to implementation of the resolution in a manner acceptable to both parties. Pakistan stands ready to assist in this endeavour.Pakistan is closely linked to the States of South Asia. These countries confront many common challenges  the foremost being that of economic and social development. By establishing the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) they have acknowledged the value of regional economic co-operation  it is my hope that in the near future they will embark on a joint endeavour to build mutual trust and confidence  to enhance regional security  and to control arms expenditures  on the basis of SAARC1s agreed principles.Pakistan desires peaceful and co-operative relations with India. We look forward to an early resumption of our dialogue. The conclusion of the non-aggression accord  which has been under negotiation since 1981  would strengthen mutual trust. Pakistan remains committed to a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir question  on the basis of the United Nations resolutions  which will usher in a new era of complete normalization and durable peace  as envisaged in the Simla Agreement.We share the concern about nuclear proliferation in the South Asian region  where one country has already demonstrated a nuclear capability. Pakistan does not have that capability  nor does it have the desire to develop nuclear weapons. Pakistan does not wish to carry out a nuclear explosion.Pakistan is prepared to go further and subscribe to a comprehensive test ban in a global  regional or bilateral context. In June this year I proposed to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi that Pakistan and India should conclude a bilateral nuclear- test-ban treaty. I look forward to a positive response. The conclusion of such a bilateral test-ban agreement between Pakistan and India would serve to assure each other# and the world  that neither country has any intention of pursuing the nuclear-weapons option.A regional approach offers the most promising avenue to prevent a nuclear-arras race in South Asia. Pakistan has proposed several equitable and non-discriminatory modalities by which this could be achieved. Our proposals include simultaneous acceptance by India and Pakistan of the Non-Proliferation Treaty or comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards; mutual inspection of each other's nuclear facilities; a joint declaration renouncing nuclear weapons; and the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia. Almost all the regional States  and a vast majority of this Assembly  support the objective of a South Asian region free from nuclear weapons. Surely  all legitimate concerns could be reconciled through dialogue and compromise. At least a serious diplomatic endeavour should be made to explore the possibilities of an agreement. For this purpose  I propose that  under the auspices of the United Nations  a conference on nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia should be convened  as soon as possible  with the participation of the regional and other interested States.The growing nuclear weapons arsenals of the super-Powers pose an ever-present threat to the survival of mankind. We welcome the understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union on intermediate nuclear forces. I hope this will be a precursor of further accords between them to reduce drastically their strategic nuclear missiles and to refrain from extending the arms race to outer space. Their decision to open talks on nuclear testing should lead to the early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. In the Geneva Disarmament Conference  a convention to ban chemical weapons is now closer at hand. This must be rapidly finalized.Among and within nations  extremes of affluence and poverty cannot coexist indefinitely. Economic inequality eventually produces strife and conflict. Injustice breeds inefficiency. This is the primary cause for the multiple economic crises confronting us today. If the world economy slows down  the developing countries will again be the principal victims.The world's economic difficulties can be overcome only through simultaneous and co-ordinated actions by developed and developing countries  to channel trade surpluses for development  to revive growth in flagging economies and thus overcome debt difficulties; to expand export access to the developing countries and stabilize commodity prices  to regulate currency flows and exchange rates more closely  and to provide emergency relief and assistance to the poorest countries. Pakistan achieved statehood at a time when the hopes of mankind for peace and progress rested heavily on the United Nations  which has emerged as the authentic voice of justice and equity· Its decisions - even those which remain unimplemented — constitute the criteria by which the conduct of States is judged.The Charter is a precious document. It enshrines a new global ideology  and its principles and purposes re-emphasize the universality and immanence of the timeless virtues proclaimed by great religions and philosophies. The Secretary-General has repeatedly stressed the need for the renewal of our commitment to the Charter. We should heed his words.On behalf of the people of Pakistan  may I say: We applaud the many accomplishments of the United Nations; we understand the reasons for its shortcomings; and we remain fully committed to its purposes and principles· Now more than ever  we believe that the United Nations is indispensable for mankind's survival and progress."
"110",5477,"PAN",42,1987,"﻿At the beginning of this statement. Sir  I would have wished to say at length how pleased the Republic of Panama is at the choice of a person as deserving as you to preside over the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would have wished as well to express special appreciation to your predecessor for the admirable work which he accomplished  and to refer in addition to the tireless and constant dedication of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to the cause of peace and the strengthening of the Organization.Similarly  following a tradition that dates back many years  I would have liked to begin this statement with a detailed list of the main world problems  followed by an explanation of the Panamanian position on them  but I find myself obliged to shorten those elements of my statement as much as possible  because on this occasion I speak on behalf of a people threatened and wounded  a nation humiliated and under attack.The tenth anniversary of the signing of the Panama Canal Treaties by my country and the United States of America occurred on 7 September. That event in 1977 was unanimously welcomed by the international community  in particular the countries of the American continent  which saw in those documents agreement on a date by which colonialism on Panamanian soil would be ended and all vestiges of colonialism would be eradicated from American lands.Unfortunately  the tenth anniversary of those Treaties was not a celebration for us Panamanians  who marked that date by expressing our indignation at the profound disillusionment of seeing that the will and resolve of that time had been distorted and the agreement replaced by a plan of aggression already set under way  carefully conceived  meticulously organized and obstinately pursued  to turn our dream of independence and sovereignty into a grotesque and pitiful farce. Last year the President of the Republic of Panama denounced in this Hall the fact that the most reactionary sectors of the United States of America  with the servile support of the extreme right of the Panamanian opposition  had mounted a campaign to discredit leading figures in the Panamanian Government in order to undermine our efforts in the Contadora Group to bring peace to Central America and silence our demand that the violations of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties be corrected.During the past year  we have seen that campaign strengthened with all sorts of unfounded accusations  especially against those authorities that have been struggling most resolutely for peace in Central America and opposing with determination United States attempts to restore and preserve a colonial pattern in the areas bordering the Canal and reduce the Panamanian Government to the status of a submissive colony.With Panama unable to obtain or exercise the right of reply in the face of the entire network of communications media that had been manipulated  the slander increased in seriousness  quantity  frequency and potential harm  because the moral aggression that forms the first part of the plan of domination was necessary to prepare United States public opinion so that it would condone any act against Panama  any injustice  any attack and any violation of the Charter of the United Nations and that of the Organization of American States (OAU). Since attainment of that goal requires a profound knowledge of the democratic sensibilities of the people of the United States  and a great familiarity with the most effective means of deceit to turn slander into widely accepted truth  there was a systematic replacement of the staff of the United States diplomatic mission in Panama and an increase in administrative and technical staff. An attempt was made to build satellite broadcasting installations  in violation of the Vienna Convention of 1961. A team was organized to host and guide official staff; politicians and correspondents so as to manipulate whatever opinions they might form on Panama. A whole parade of alleged violations of human rights and alleged weaknesses in democratic institutions was staged. Indeed  the entire United States diplomatic mission seemed to have been turned into a factory for slander and lies  with its own distribution and dissemination machinery. The complaints that we have lodged about this at the highest levels of the United States Administration have remained unanswered.The other Governments of the world  which have access to sources of information that no one manipulates or falsifies  are governed by their own principles and act in accordance with their own interests  know that these are not the facts  and they must have already begun to wonder why the United States of America is acting in this way with regard to Panama. Later  they will begin to see the answers to this question  because I must now go on to the second part of the plans economic aggression.In the past 10 years we have had increasing success in the plan of the revolutionary Government of Panama to create a great financial centre  taking advantage of the very special advantages that my country can offer  and this has become a new source of wealth and work for the people of Panama. As the number of foreign banks with branches in Panama increased  and as funds deposited in those branches grew to billions of dollars  the pressure put on Panama by the United States Government to reform its bank legislation also increased. They demanded changes that might make the banks consider it more appropriate and lucrative to transfer their operations to another country  which would thus put an end to the flourishing of these activities  which represent 9 000 permanent jobs. When it was seen that the campaign of slander against Panama was not affecting the financial centre and that Panama was only agreeing to those specific changes that could facilitate joint efforts against the illicit drug traffic  the financial centre became one of the targets of the plan of aggression. All the seditious actions of the past three and a half months have had as their principal arena the heart of the banking area of Panama City  and news articles with photographs of people setting fire to automobiles or bags of garbage  with the name of a foreign bank in the background  had the effect that the slander of the mass media had not achieved.Just three months ago  Panama denounced before the Organization of American States and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries a resolution adopted by the United States Senate which violates internationally recognized principles accepted as fundamental to the peaceful coexistence of nations. In its brazen arrogance  the resolution even cited legal norms and formulas that should be applied to remove from their posts those Panamanian officials whom the plan of aggression had singled out as pawns to be cleared off the infamous chess-board that had been set up. Last week  while Heads of State or Government and representatives of various nations were expressing their support for the cause of peace in Central America in this Organization and reiterating their support for the principles of the United Nations Charter  the United States Senate  with total disdain for international legal norms  adopted a resolution imposing conditions on economic assistance  military aid and arms exports to Panama  as well as on imports of Panamanian sugar to the United States of America  unless  within 45 days  a transition Government were established in Panama in compliance with the will of United States senators.By one of those ironies in which history abounds  the oppressor often commits a blunder that favours the oppressed  and the last days of that time period coincide with the national holiday of Panama. The deadline is on the eve of the date when Panamanians commemorate Panama's Proclamation of Independence from the Spanish Empire. On that day we shall be reaffirming that Proclamation of Independence with the firmest possible resolve.As if the violation of the principles of self-determination of peoples and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States were not enough  the recent Senate resolution violates specific norms adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. I should like briefly to cite a few of them.Article 32 of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States establishes ""No State may use or encourage the use of economic  political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights."" (resolution 3281 (XXIX) General Assembly resolution 36/103 on the inadmissibility of intervention in the Internal affairs of States clearly affirms. ""The duty of a State  in the conduct of its international relations in the economic  social  technical and trade fields  to refrain from measures which would constitute interference or intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State  thus preventing it from determining freely its political  economic and social development; this includes  inter alia  the duty of a State not to use its external economic assistance programme or adopt any multilateral or unilateral economic reprisal or blockade ... as instruments of political pressure or coercion against another State  in violation of the Charter of the United Nations."" (resolution 36/103  Sec. II para. 00)In resolution 41/165  adopted just last year  the General Assembly ""Reaffirms that developed countries should refrain from threatening or applying trade restrictions  blockades  embargoes and other economic sanctions  incompatible with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and in violation of undertakings contracted  multilaterally and bilaterally  against developing countries as a form of political and economic coercion that affects their economic  political and social development."" (resolution 41/165  para  3)I should like to affirm before this Assembly that however overwhelming and formidable the might of a nation may be  it shall never have the power to alter the significance of these norms  nor to evade the moral condemnation of other nations for having violated them.That brings me to the third phase of the aggression that has already begun to emerge and that I now denounce  on behalf of the Government of Panama  before all the other Governments of the States Members of this Organization. At about noon on Wednesday  23 September  this very month  while the Ambassador of the United States of America was hosting a luncheon at his official residence with his councillor and with many figures of the opposition recognized as the main local leaders of that attempt to overthrow the Panamanian Government which I have been denouncing  over 100 soldiers of the United States armed forces stationed in the defence zones in the area bordering the Canal  whose sole purpose is the defence of the inter-oceanic waterway  arrived in two buses at the United States Embassy building and parked there  in violation of the procedures established in the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and its related agreements on the displacement and transport of those foreign troops.At the same time  a Black Hawk UH 60 helicopter  bearing registration plates M-23985  from the Howard military air base near the Canal landed some 10 kilometres from the northern air strip of the Rio Hato airport  where there are military installations belonging to the Panamanian defence forces  without using established air corridors and in violation of Panamanian air space. Its pilot refused to respond to demands from the control tower that he identify himself and indicate the purpose of the flight  and the aircraft took off when a Panamanian land patrol approached it.I must explain that if I am mentioning these details even though it is unusual to do so in United Nations statements on such occasions  it is because one of the main strengths of the Republic of Panama is the support for the cause of national liberation of my people that the repudiation of similar acts of aggression arouses in other nations.The Panama Canal Treaties  which tomorrow will formally have been in force for eight years  very intentionally took into consideration the fact that the patriotic sensibilities of the Panamanian people had been deeply wounded for many years by the United States military presence in the colonial enclave they maintained there for 75 years - years of humiliation and outrage by foreign soldiers who often behaved like victorious occupation troops.For that reason  the Treaties included provisions that even prohibit the wearing of foreign military uniforms outside specifically established areas of defence  except in the case of official occasions. I must  with great indignation and sadness  emphasize here that a luncheon given by the head of a diplomatic mission and his deputy for the leaders of a movement aimed at overthrowing the Government of the country where they are accredited is not an official occasion. What occurred constitutes  it must be said  a premeditated and calculated provocation with the intention of creating a situation conducive to some act of violence that would justify to United States public opinion the aggression that forms the third stage of the plan.As was to be expected  there has already been a nationwide reaction which can be seen in many declarations by trade union and student organizations  reviving language that had not been heard in my country since the days that followed the act of aggression committed by United States troops against the Panamanian civilian population that caused 21 deaths and left over 500 people wounded.Why such outrage? Why is a country as large and powerful as the United States pitting itself against a nation which has tendered it great services and against a people which has always shown it friendship?One day soon  Government leaders will understand that it is not possible for this atrocious game of inventing slander and fabricating lies to continue without endangering their own democratic institutions. That is why we must now explain why a sinister coalition of forces is acting against the independence and sovereignty of Panama  as well as against the Government which  in an unequal contest  is now defending the country's status as an independent and sovereign State. For almost five years now the Governments of Colombia  Mexico  Venezuela and Panama have been acting together to promote agreement on a peaceful negotiated solution in Central America. Time and again  with similar recourse or by other means  as the case may be  foreign interference has succeeded in thwarting the initiative that emerged in 1983 and that first gathered together the countries of the Contadora Group and then the countries of the Support Group  with the approval of all nations in general and  in particular  with the sincere and resolute support of the nations comprising the European Economic Community and the Non-Aligned Movement. We have had to pay a high price for our perseverance and insistence on achieving a Latin American solution to this Latin American problem. As we overcame the obstacles one by one  obstacles created or fostered to a large extent by sectors of the United States Government  and as prospects of peace began to emerge more clearly  pressures mounted on the Panamanian Government to leave the Contadora Group and to withdraw its support for the cause of peace in the region.When the position of the four countries of the Contadora Group was aligned with the position of Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay  a military member of the United States National Security Council personally demanded of General Manuel Antonio Noriega that Panama withdraw from the Contadora Group. When he was told that the demand was an affront to the dignity of our people and nation a plan was hatched to subjugate Panama. Three months later there began a wide-ranging replacement of United States diplomatic staff  followed by an increase in the number of administrative and technical staff and increases in the number of troops stationed along the Canal  in disregard of the ban on such increases contained in the treaties in force between the two countries.The reactionary forces in the United States Government that conspired to destroy Panama's independence found it crucial to replace the Panamanian Government with a compliant Government that would blindly follow its orders.At the forty-first session  in Panama's statement  the President of Panama Eric Arturo Delvalle  denounced a plot to evade implementation of the Canal Treaties  under which the Canal is to be turned over to full Panamanian control within 12 years and the United States military presence in our territory is to end at the same time.That statement and the further denunciations of many violations committed by the United States lent a new dimension to the plan of aggression already set in motion with the manipulation of some United States communications media and some local and foreign news agencies to bring about acceptance of the slanders invented for use as the main weapon in the dirty war declared against those who defend my country's independence and sovereignty.The United Nations was a beautiful and promising result of the sacrifices made by mankind in the struggle against fascist barbarism. Its most powerful members paid with countless human lives and incalculable destruction to learn the tragic lesson I am now recalling. Half a century is not long enough for people to forget.In its structure  in its methods  in the way its combined forces operate  in its organization  and in its tactics  the movement threatening my country bears a terrifying resemblance to the fascist movements that laid waste and subjugated Europe.Despite those resemblances  the United States Senate has chosen in support of that movement to play the sinister card of interventionist action and economic aggression  thus presenting a grave danger to all the nations of the Americas and a tangible threat to world peace. If the United States Government used all its might to impose on Panama a minority Government which submitted to its desire for domination  no nation in the world would be able to feel that its independence and sovereignty were secure or that a similar attempt could not materialize at its own borders.If the Panamanian people had not rejected the seditious outbreak that  with the support  aid and instigation of certain sectors of the United States Government  tried to overthrow the Panamanian Government and replace it with a provisional Government obedient to the orders of the United States Embassy in Panama  I should not be here now making this denunciation. Since the beginning of the decade  a few years after the new Canal Treaties came into effect  Panama has been sounded out unofficially  and has received various other representations  about the possibility of an agreement extending authorization of military installations on Panamanian territory beyond the year 2000.Prominent members and representatives of the United States military establishment have said  with an insistence that is significant  that the problem of the military presence  which will end in 12 years with the coming into effect of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties  requires that the United States Government make decisions and take actions that must be begun at the latest in 1989 - that is  within 15 months.Under the agreement reached in 1977  the United States armed forces are to be gradually reduced in number  and at the same time the role of protecting the Canal is to be transferred in an orderly  gradual way to the defence forces of Panama. Despite that  in the past five years United States forces have grown significantly  instead of decreasing  and increased participation by the Panamanians in those functions has been systematically forgotten and delayed.For some years now  with growing frequency and at the highest level  as time goes by  civilian and military officials of the United States have been saying that the approach of the date set for the final implementation of the Canal Treaties and the end of the United States military presence in Panama is a problem demanding immediate attention.The Panamanian Government has had only one answer to the soundings and veiled proposals that have reached it} that answer has always been that Panama demands that the Treaties be complied with to the letter. This sheds a revealing light on the fact that the minority political forces comprising the movement opposing the Panamanian Government have always been in favour of the United States keeping military bases in Panama beyond the year 2000.Shortly before the organized attack against the constitutional Government of Panama there were discussions in the United States Congress and reports on the financial cost of leaving the existing installations in Panama and the repercussions of doing so on United States strategic interests. Recent State Department documents have gone to unbelievable extremes of brazenness in recommending measures for the structuring of a new Government in Panama to defend those strategic interests. Outstanding among the excesses in this plot against my country  and a grim threat  is the fact that the United States Senate is trying to impose in Panama a provisional Government that  according to repeated public statements by the main leaders of this treason  would have as its President the very man who was overthrown in 1941 for his attempts to make Panama an ally of Hitler's Germany. That makes clear another motive of the plan against Panama  and once again demonstrates how dangerous it is for the other nations of the American continent and the ideals of this Organization.Aware of the terrible price now being paid for the independence of its foreign policy  Panama reiterates its unswerving commitment to the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement  and it hopes to see in the near future the establishment of a new international economic order. At one with those who promote the new trend of the unity of the Latin American countries  Panama believes that the strengthening of that unity requires  as an immediate task  the achievement of peace in Central America and the fraternal comprehension and generosity that will give Bolivia access to the sea. Such demonstrations of maturity and solidarity will make the Latin American peoples better able to fight for the cause of Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas  South Sandwich and South Georgia's Islands  for the full attainment of self-determination by Puerto Rico  for a political solution to the foreign-debt problem and for the eradication of the drug traffic as a service rendered to other nations where this scourge increases the moral breakdown of major sectors of the population. It will therefore also be better able to form an invincible front against slander organized as a tool of war against the independence of our nations.As a country where all forms of racial discrimination disappeared over half a century before slavery was abolished in the United States  Panama condemns the odious divisions of society in South Africa and once again expresses its firm solidarity with the people of Namibia. We reiterate our support for the aspirations of Spain in connection with Gibraltar and urge that peace be achieved between Iran and Iraq and that peace be brought to Lebanon. We reaffirm also out support for any action that can lead to peace between Arabs and Israelis  on the basis of the right of the State of Israel to exist within secure boundaries  as is established in a United Nations resolution. Panama once again affirms its people's solidarity with the Sahraoui people. It shares the aspirations of Cyprus  Afghanistan and Kampuchea to be free of any foreign military presence  and expresses its hope of soon seeing the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea represented in the General Assembly as Members of the Organization. The proposals for a ministerial meeting to deal with the unification of the Korean peninsula should be agreed to without delay.Despite the moral aggression that it is suffering and the danger of military aggression that it is confronting  Panama will continue to fight for a Latin American solution to the crisis of Central America and will continue to demand the implementation of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty  with the Canal under full Panamian control as of 31 December 1999  under the agreed terms and with the United States military presence ended on that date.The Republic of Panama has full grounds for invoking the principles of this Organization and for making use of all the legitimate means that the norms of international law place at its disposal) and it is beginning to do so by openly stating that those principles and those norms have been violated by the United States  first through prolonged  severe moral aggression against the Panamanian Government and then through calculated  base economic aggression.I affirm also that those principles and those norms are in danger of being converted into a dead letter by the use of force against the independence of my country. Because of the magnitude of that danger  we Panamanians must continue to fight for national liberation  regardless of the harsh times that lie ahead and the extraordinary sacrifices required to defend the Panamanian nation against the aggressors. We shall never be subjugated."
"111",5524,"PER",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  I wish to offer you greetings from the people and Government of Peru and to express my pleasure at the fact that you have been elected to guide the deliberations of the highest forum of the international community. Your dedication to the process of international understanding is the best guarantee of the successful accomplishment of your task. I must also may how much we encourage  how much we appreciate  and how grateful we are to our Secretary-General  whose unanimous re-election is the best tribute the international community can offer to his selfless work for international peace and security.We are living through a dangerous period of deterioration in the international system  a fact which makes it imperative to establish a new rationality and strengthen the machinery available  so that the solutions to the world's great problems may be dealt with properly on the multilateral level. We are particularly concerned at the crisis of the United Nations system in which  above and beyond purely financial and substantive factors  we perceive attempts to weaken the Organization  to compromise its independence and to neutralize its role as a negotiating forum for major international issues.Attempts are thus being made to erode multilateralism and thereby deprive the developing countries of the world's decision-making processes. Attempts are being made to do this in such a way that the relevant bodies will not be able to play their proper role  not merely as a group of operational bodies working in co-operation  but as factors of change in the very foundations of the system  and instruments for the attainment of a democratised international order.Ours is an Organization with an imbalance  to the detriment of the developing countries. The imbalance is expressed through the veto in the Security Council as well as through financial domination  which has the effect of an additional veto  and through the concentration - an almost hereditary concentration - of the main posts in the Organization in a group of countries.Therefore  any reform  far from increasing the inequalities in the United Nations  should  on the contrary  effectively democratise it  resolve its financial problems without political mortgages  and consolidate its functional independence  in order to enable it to achieve its great objectives of peace and development. What is required is a new concept of the United Nations system  one that would enable it to respond to the challenge of structural change experienced by international relations in the post-industrial society; so that it may be able to give direction to the emerging trends and avoid the threat to the third world of the establishment of more serious dependence and the distortion of basic elements of the nation-State.For this purpose it is imperative to bring about a collective process of reflection and diagnosis that will make it possible to determine a new approach to the institutional structure of the international system  to review and revise the now obsolete schemes of the post-war period; and to anticipate the requirements of a new international dynamism.We are living in a period of what promises to be a new stage in the disarmament process. The recent agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union give us encouraging signs  for the first time  of the reversal of the fatal arms race. We are inspired by the hope that the universal conscience in favour of peace and disarmament - which motivated the Harare message of the Heads of State of the non-aligned countries - will in the end triumph over the egocentric visions of security  which still cause many to spend great resources to win an impossible war  instead of making a reality of a peace without victories  based on the full realization and understanding of international social justice.Let us trust that this progress will also help to usher in substantial progress in the total banning of nuclear tests  the prevention of the militarization of space  the strengthening of multilateral negotiations with regard to other aspects of disarmament  and the releasing of resources for economic and social development. In the regional and sub regional area  we are persevering in the organization of convergent efforts to promote development through the social reorientation of the resources allocated to defence expenditures  an ongoing process now  which is conducive to the strengthening of regional security  based on a new dynamic of co-operation  Integration and solidarity. We believe that the zones of peace can serve to strengthen international security and help in regional development work. In this area my country is in favour of a zone of peace in the southern Pacific. At the centre of this concern is the indissoluble relationship between disarmament and development and its connection with a democratic and fully integrated concept of security. Despite frustrations  the recent International Conference on the subject has offered us a valuable opportunity to clarify concepts and open a debate which  we hope  will soon be universal and sufficiently imaginative to establish appropriate ways and means to make this relationship effective and to promote genuine international co-operation towards renewed and fruitful multilateralism.A significant contribution will be made by the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace  Disarmament and Development in Latin America  which will shortly be Inaugurated in Lima  in accordance with the Assembly's unanimous decision last year. We trust that the Regional Centre will make it possible to mobilize the collective efforts of countries in the region in the area of the interrelationship between disarmament and development and its impact on the conflict-peace relationship.In hosting this new institution  which belongs to all countries of the region  Peru will be unflagging in its efforts to increase the Centre's vitality and effectiveness and urges Member States to give it genuine and unwavering co-operation. On the initiative of Peru and the Group of 77 the General Assembly has for two years now been considering the grave problem of the external debt of developing countries. These considerations have had the following positive results; the adoption of resolution 41/202 and the points agreed on recently in UNCTAD VII. Thus it would appear that everyone agrees on the seriousness of the problem. Nevertheless  the debt problem is growing daily  owing to the lack of universal agreement on how to implement a valid strategy for its solution. Endeavouring to solve the external-debt crisis through the imposition of adjustments and continuous refinancing is wrong.Indeed  the constant process of debt refinancing makes it possible for the creditors to convert devalued loans into new loans with additional interest  thus increasing the principal and servicing. In other words  this refinancing thus establishes a permanent transfer of financial resources to the creditors - that is  perpetual tribute to be paid by the debtor developing countries.In this way the debt expresses an asymmetry that is the product of a power policy that still accepts neither co-responsibility for the debt problem  nor flexibility in recognizing the real value of the debt in order to accede to historical interest rates  nor the real ability to pay of the debtors based on the requirements of their social and economic development.As a consequence  the developing countries are increasingly adopting unilateral measures to reclaim their sovereignty and their peoples' right to development  thus limiting the transfer of resources and rejecting perpetual tribute to international financial profiteers. Thus  in the face of the abuse of the laws of the creditors  the justness of the laws of the debtors is suddenly arising.If the debt burden has succeeded In reversing the logic of international co-operation  stretching the financial system to the limits of its credibility and political viability  the phenomenon of the international drug traffic is now reaching a scope that not only undermine the very essence of states but also add to an already critical international scene a criminal structure of formidable proportions.In this context  it is encouraging to point out the fundamental importance of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  held in Vienna  which marks a new stage in the political treatment of a problem that has deep and complex social  economic and political connotations; the final declaration contains basic principles to which my country subscribes.The decrease in prices of raw materials and the scarcity of resources generated by the debt crisis contrast scandalously with the geometric rise in financial resources destined for drug consumption. Peru considers that the time has come to mobilize the support of consumer countries to make possible a massive flow of financial resources to the producer countries that will enable a radical change to be made in the artificially created production structure created by drug traffic in specific regions of the world. What must be done is to substitute the Incentive of agricultural producers towards a harmful prosperity based on drugs with an effective  profitable type of agricultural activity with guaranteed export markets coming from a new agro-industrial production structure.Two years ago when the General Assembly approved an important resolution on terrorism  the United Nations assumed a unanimous commitment. However  not enough has yet been done to establish international conditions obstructing a climate propitious to terrorist activities. I believe it is urgent to promote a widespread stabilization of open rejection of organizations which  under political or cultural pretexts  would create in developed societies attitudes of tolerance for the proselytising action of agents of groups that impose violence and death on our democracies and work against our peoples' aspirations for freedom and justice. The initiatives put forward to distinguish between terrorism and the legitimate Struggles of liberation movements against colonialism  apartheid and foreign occupation are positive steps which should make it possible for us to move forward 'to this direction with greater determination. One year after the last Summit Conference  in Harare  we observe in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries a new dynamic with respect to the challenge of our times. The non-aligned countries must respond to a fluid international situation with unity and effective actions  incorporating our own perspective and consolidating our Movement as a negotiating force capable of promoting effective solutions to the grave problems of the world.In this context the non-aligned countries are concerned over the intensification of hotbeds of tension - wrongly dubbed ""remaining"" hotbeds - which should appropriately be considered by the General Assembly.My country is deeply disturbed by the escalation and undue prolongation of t conflict between Iran and Iraq and supports the peace process initiated by the Security Council and the crucial role of the Secretary-General. The problem of southern Africa remains unresolved because of the intransigent of those who oppose our struggle to replace the abhorrent apartheid regime and achieve independence for Namibia - heroic undertakings with which Peru wishes to state its unflagging solidarity.We are encouraged by the progress made recently on the convening of an international conference on the Middle East for a peaceful solution to the problem in keeping with the security requirements of all the parties and with respect for the rights of the Palestinian people. Similarly  we support the Secretary-General's efforts for a negotiated political settlement of the situation in Afghanistan on the basis of the independence  non-alignment and self-determination of that nation.Once more we voice our fraternal support for the just demand of Argentina for the recovery of its sovereign rights over the Malvinas Islands  and we stress the urgency of negotiations to eradicate that vestige of colonialism. With respect to the situation in Central America  Peru has always been convinced that It is possible to find a peaceful solution based on the right of the countries of the sub-region to decide on their own destiny free from any foreign Interference or intervention; and we express our solidarity with Nicaragua in the defence of its sovereignty  Independence  territorial integrity  stability and self-determination.  The present session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when this situation in Central America is such that there are new prospects for the long-sought peace process to be successful as a result of the initiatives of the Contadora and Support Groups. We are deeply pleased that on 7 August last the Central American Presidents signed a document on procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America and thus formed an executive commission to make viable the implementation of peace agreements  within which new dynamic the International Verification and follow-up Commission was established.We hail this great step of the Central American Governments which calls for the adoption of a resolution of great historical importance that confirms the broad and unrestricted support of the international community for the peace process agreed on in Guatemala and gives a clear mandate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to support the implementation of that peace process  and in particular the work of the International Verification and Follow-up Commission.Latin America has assumed the challenge of acting boldly in the world  using its rich experience and its own ideas and perceptions to become a factor for change in international relations.In so doing  Latin America is aware of the need to change international economic structures; it identifies with the cause of the poor  deprived countries of the world and their desire to achieve development  which is a right and an international responsibility. In our region itself  we promote schemes for political co-operation and economic integration and further measures to make viable our development and strengthen our potential for working together.Our first experience in dialogue  agreement and harmonization in the area of security has been the peace initiatives of the Contadora and Support Groups in the case of Central America. This exercise in solidarity has given rise to an experience in political co-operation known as the Group of Bight  which will find full expression in the meeting of Presidents to be held in Mexico next November.This new framework for political harmonization  established on a solid basis of democracy  flexibility and non-exclusivity  is an attempt to establish the nucleus of a process of co-ordination in the Latin American region which will draw the region together and consolidate its presence in the international system through the innovative work of a new political organization  an economic identity of its own and re-conceptualisation of its collective security.Similarly  of very great importance is the decision adopted in recent days by the member countries of SELA  the Latin American Economic System  to hold annual meetings of Foreign Ministers prior to the sessions of the General Assembly in order to examine  through direct and informal dialogue  the international situation and its repercussions in our region  as well as actions to strengthen the unity and joint actions of Latin America and the Caribbean. Those meetings  oriented around dialogue and political harmonization  give SELA a new dimension and held much promise for regional unity.The crisis of the international system confronts the developing countries with critical situations and conditions in which national efforts to bring the great masses out of centuries of poverty are threatened by interests that want to maintain an unjust and unhealthy status quo.Peru  in the midst of historical difficulties that have resulted from its being a third world country - difficulties aggravated by the aggression of terrorism and the extortion of debt - provides an acid test on how democratically to achieve structural transformations conducive to the consolidation of a popular nationalist programme. If the adjustment policies of a discredited financial system have overshadowed negotiations to achieve a new international order  it is today more necessary than ever that the developing countries create an alternative based on growth that includes the redistribution of wealth - that is  a new concept of development.In this important world forum there has been advanced the thesis that the relationship between the role of the State and development is a contradictory one  and the growth experienced in the informal economic sector has been given as an example. The Government of Peru feels that such a contradiction does not exist  especially if the actions of States are oriented precisely towards avoiding the oligarchic and oligopolic concentration of property and production so as to give all citizens  especially the poorest and most marginal  access to the means necessary for fulfilment in the context of a more just  egalitarian and therefore authentically democratic society·It has also been said that the right to development is simply the right of economic agents to act freely· If this assembly of nations has enshrined the right to development as one of the basic rights of the human person and of peoples  it is because as time passes an international structure of domination and exploitation is increasingly frustrating and destroying the capacity of our countries to achieve their national development objectives. Whatever economic or social model is used  the development indicators and the living standards of practically all third world countries have declined to the levels of 20 years ago  which proves the structural and global nature of a crisis that is the consequence of relationships of power and an international economic order that brings down the prices of our raw materials  obstructs the access of our products to markets  favours regressive adjustment measures aimed at ensuring the repayment of unpayable debts under the original terms  and makes international co-operation dependent on the submission and subjection of the developing countries to being tributaries of those who benefit from that unjust order.On the other hand  if those adjustment policies are to be replaced with anti-crisis policies of growth and redistribution  which is what we have done in Peru  a bridge must be built between the needs of the immediate present and long-term requirements in order to achieve a new international economic order. The achievement of a consensus on this approach would sow the seed of new development for the coming century.At this time Peru wishes to express once again its fraternal  militant solidarity with all peoples fighting for freedom  peace and justice and to reaffirm its desire for understanding and international co-operation and its commitment to the principles and purposes of this Organization and its responsibility to build a better  more secure and more just world.

"112",5571,"PHL",42,1987,"﻿ I wish  Sir  to convey to you the felicitations of the people and Government of the Philippines on your unanimous election as President of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. You bring to that high office outstanding qualifications and long experience in diplomacy  particularly in the United Nations. It is therefore especially appropriate that you should be leading our deliberations in this critical period in the history of the United Nations  and it is with great confidence that we look forward to your stewardship of the General Assembly.I should like  at the same time  to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  who provided able and effective leadership during the forty-first session. I wish also to pay tribute to the United Nations Secretary—General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his painstaking efforts on behalf of peace in the world. His annual report highlights the major issues before the Organization and contains important recommendations which should guide us in our deliberations. Throughout the more than 40 years of existence of the United Nations the Assembly's agenda has been focused on the quest of man for a world order based on peace  harmony/ security and prosperity. Although the Assembly meets every year  the unique service of this forum is today more important than ever  for today the international community is confronted with a serious crisis of confidence in the collective ability of nations to move together towards a common goal. Despite the many approaches that have been tried in recent years/ the causes of world conflicts have not disappeared. Indeed  these conflicts could become worse as the political will to solve them. At the same time  every effort to turn each crisis into opportunity generates the momentum towards the elusive goals of genuine peace and prosperity.The Philippines comes to the forty-second session of the General Assembly under a new mandate and inspiration. The Filipino people have ratified a new Constitution by which they hope to build a just and humane society and pursue their ideals and aspirations under the rule of law in a regime of truth  justice  freedom  love  equality and peace. In our relations with the international community we give paramount consideration to safeguarding our national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to respecting the right to self-determination of all nations. We have renounced war as an instrument of national policy and adopted the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land.In pursuit of our programme of national reconstruction we convened  following a general election  a new Congress of the Philippines that is truly representative of the people and committed to giving meaning and reality to their will.My delegation is deeply touched by and grateful for the many expressions of sympathy and support for the Philippines and the Government of President Aquino which have been heard in this Assembly. With its new set of credentials  the Philippines seeks to fulfil its international responsibility and contribute to the common effort to build a better world for ourselves and our children. This universal aspiration is embodied in the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. Although the international community has committed itself to these objectives in the resonant language of repeated declarations  we remain fragmented and are often in conflict  independently pursuing our individual interests and preferring to rely on the security and comfort of our respective national shells.The world is waking up to the erosion of many traditional premises  which are not being replaced by new principles upon which to base the resolution of our difficulties. As decision-makers faced with the responsibility of managing these challenges we must find  through discussion and by means of concerted action  new answers to age-old problems. It is our duty to construct a new system of international relations based on the reality of growing and genuine interdependence and on the principles of justice and equity that will both respond to our collective interests and permit us to achieve our respective national objectives.The first element in this noble mission is the maintenance of international peace and security. Modern history has recorded the failure of innumerable attempts to stabilize the level of armaments of the world Powers. Today  in an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion and in the face of an ever escalating arras race  the super-Powers wrangle in a tug-of-war of gambit and rejection  while the rest of the world watches in horror lest the hair-trigger situation explode into a holocaust. Worse still  the danger is being carried over to outer space  which  as mankind's common heritage  should be reserved exclusively for the uses of peace. Meanwhile  scarce resources that could be utilized for improving the lives of the peoples and fulfilling the potential of the nations of the world are being dissipated. It is ironic that the Powers involved in the arms race are the very same nations as are entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining peace and security within the United Nations system. In this context  the Philippines welcomes the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union have reached agreement in principle to eliminate intermediate-range missiles  We hope that this will be followed by an agreement to reduce# if not eliminate  intercontinental systems. We also encourage progress towards an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union for the reduction of strategic arsenals at the levels which they set last year in Reykjavik. These are vital steps in the continuing effort towards the goal of ensuring a safer world for mankind.Conflicts and disputes of various kinds rend the fabric of peace in some regions of the world. These conflicts result as much from a fundamental lack of respect for the rights of men and nations as from the prejudice  arrogance and greed that motivate the disregard of these rights.In South-East Asia the hapless nation of Kampuchea is in the grip of a military occupation that continues to be a threat to the peace and stability of the region. The political sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea have been violated  and violence has been Inflicted on the dignity of its people. Thousands of refugees have been driven across national borders and now live under the most difficult conditions.The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  to which the Philippines belongs in solidarity of purpose  has worked tirelessly for a durable and comprehensive political settlement that will restore peace  freedom  independence and justice to the Kampuchean people and stability in the region. In this  ASEAN has received the support of the overwhelming majority of nations  support expressed in particular in resolutions approved by large majorities in the General Assembly.Together with its ASEAN partners  the Philippines welcomes the recent agreement to hold an informal meeting  initially among Kampucheans and subsequently with the participation of Viet Nam. We hope that this meeting will be the beginning of a dialogue that will eventually lead to negotiations and ultimately to a solution to the problem of Kampuchea.It will be a solution  we trust  from which will emerge a Kampuchea whose destiny is determined by its own people  free from outside interference  a Kampuchea that is independent  neutral and non-aligned  headed by leaders of the Kampucheans own choosing. At the same time the solution should take into account the security and other interests of all the countries concerned.It is precisely such a solution that is envisioned in the draft resolution that is to be submitted under the agenda item  ""The situation in Kampuchea"". By again voting in favour of this resolution  therefore. Member States will be helping to hasten the settlement of the Kampuchean conflict. We must emphasize once again that an acceptable and enduring settlement must include the realization of this proposition: Viet Nam must leave Kampuchea.In the same manner  the world expects from the Powers concerned a positive response in respect of Afghanistan. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan must be upheld and all foreign forces there must be withdrawn. Afghan refugees must be returned to their homes in safety and honour. The Afghan people must be left alone to determine their own form of government and their own economic  political and social system  free from outside intervention.The Philippines has taken note of the efforts at national reconciliation in Afghanistan and of the pronouncements on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country. However  we believe that these steps fall short of the principles embodied in General Assembly resolution 41/33  which calls for the immediate and total withdrawal of foreign troops.Foreign troops must leave Afghanistan.As great a tragedy on the contemporary scene is the plight of Namibia  captive of a racist regime that for the last 21 years has defied all calls from the Security Council and the General Assembly to withdraw from Namibia. South Africa continues to violate the human rights and dignity of the Namibians  plunders Namibia's natural resources  and denies the country its independence and rightful place in the family of nations. South Africa must leave Namibia. South Africa must set Namibia free.A state of genuine peace  harmony and stability is possible under conditions that recognize and respect the dignity of man. What evil force drives South Africa to defy the whole world bewilders the civilized mind. History does not have to pass judgement on South Africa. Humanity confronted with the gravest of moral issues - that is  apartheid - has already judged it. The judgement must be executed. There must be an end to the attempt to shield South Africa from the world's anger on the basis of any excuse or rationalization. The imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter is the only peaceful means available to create the necessary environment of change. This is imperative and urgent.The Security Council's unanimous call in resolution 598 (1987) of 20 July 1987 for a cease-fire in the eight-year-old war between Iran and Iraq must be upheld. No effort should be spared to prevent the worsening of a war nobody wants. My delegation supports the Secretary-General's efforts on behalf of peace in the Persian Gulf.The Middle East conflict has remained a tinderbox for too long. A just  comprehensive and lasting settlement must be achieved if we are to eliminate a major cause of international instability. The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization and to establish an independent State in Palestine must be recognized. At the same time  the right of all States in the region to live in peace and within secure boundaries  free from threats or acts of force  must be upheld. The convening under the auspices of the United Nations of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned and the five permanent members of the Security Council would be a most appropriate means for the resolution of the conflict. We pay a tribute to the Central American countries for the historic agreement which they recently reached in Guatemala City. It augurs well for the peace  security and stability of that troubled region. It also speaks well o£ a political will founded on wisdom and statesmanship. We call on all the countries concerned to carry out this landmark agreement.My delegation supports the resumption of negotiations on the Korean question at the earliest possible time. In keeping with the principle of universality and for the sake of international peace and stability  the Philippines supports the admission to membership of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the United Nations under Article 4 of the Charter.The disputes in the Malvinas and in Western Sahara call for similar approaches. Efforts leading to their effective resolution  both direct negotiations and use of the good offices of the Secretary-General  must be encouraged.The United Nations must take the lead in reversing the worsening global economic situation. Our hope for enduring global peace  harmony and security cannot be realized in a world beset with glaring economic inequity and injustice  which create serious instabilities in many areas of the world. What is required is for us to go beyond rhetoric and take action. We are after all  not starting from scratch. There are principles and courses of action that have long been embodied in many declarations  joint communiqués  resolutions and decisions of the United Nations  we already have the Programme of Action for a New International Economic Order  the United Nations International Development Strategies# the Vienna Programme of Action for Science and Technology  and many more. However  there has been some unwillingness to give practical application to those instruments. If the international community had done what is called for in those instruments  we would be living in a better world than we have today.We are aware of the obstacles that lie ahead of us. The reluctance of the industrialized nations to undertake appropriate industrial restructuring prevents world trade from regaining its buoyancy. The general slow-down in the flow of development resources from bilateral sources and international financial institutions deprives the developing countries  particularly the debt-ridden among them  of the means to achieve economic growth.Trade protectionism constitutes a frustrating barrier to the developing nations' economic aspirations. Their foreign debt is a crushing burden on those countries  bringing about great social and political tensions in their societies ad hoc and piecemeal management of the debt problem has been anti-development  destabilizing and inequitable. While there is a growing recognition of the principle of shared responsibility of debtors and creditors  the actual burden has been borne primarily  if not entirely  by the debtor countries  for which the costs of adjustment are intolerably onerous.My delegation believes that economic growth must take precedence over debt servicing. Developing countries must have a reasonable economic growth that will enable their peoples to enjoy adequate standards of living. The long-term  interests of the creditors are better served by the continued stability of the debtor countries and the viability of the global financial system. The Philippines therefore supports a proposal to convene an international conference on money and finance to discuss a just and lasting solution to the debt problem.We are called upon to take bold steps and innovative approaches in the political and economic spheres to meet the challenges of today. We are also called upon to take concerted action and respond to the mandate in the Preamble of the United Nations Charter ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"".No effort to improve the quality of life can have meaning apart from the general well-being of the human person. The impairment of social life  the threat of disease  poverty and malnutrition  and the outrages that injure or violate the dignity of the human person could render ineffective  even meaningless  whatever gains are made in other fields.Last year the General Assembly adopted 68 resolutions on social  cultural and humanitarian matters. They encompass the promotion and protection of human rights the International Campaign Against Abuse of and Illegal Trafficking in Drugs; women  youth  the disabled and the aging·  crime prevention and criminal justice racism  racial discrimination  and the right to self-determination. The resolutions provide the building blocks that have resulted in a number of United Nations treaties and conventions. Thus  the United Nations has done much in setting standards by which the Member countries can measure their performance. We the Members of the United Nations  must match our zeal with concrete proposals  resolutions and decisions and place our collective determination and political will behind their implementation. The Philippine Government remains steadfast in its adherence to human tights and social justice and in the commitment of the new Constitution to giving the highest priority to the enactment of measures that protect and enhance the right of the people to human dignity  reduce social  economic and political inequalities  and remove cultural inequities by equitably diffusing wealth and political power for the common good."" We place the highest value on those United Nations instruments which promote and protect human dignity and the worth of the individual.To the extent that the United Nations has become the guardian of the highest moral values of humanity  the promotion and protection of human rights must keep its place high on the United Nations agenda. And  even as we keep vigilant watch over the conduct of individual Governments  we must constantly urge one another to renew our commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other instruments in this field.To signify the Philippine Government's unwavering support of the international struggle against apartheid. President Aquino recently signed  in the presence of General Joseph Garba  Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid  the instrument of ratification of the International Convention against Apartheid in Sports.The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment entered into force on 26 June of this year. The Convention represents a major step forward towards the world-wide proscription of torture. However  our intent to promote and protect human rights must be accompanied by an earnest effort to carry out our corresponding obligations.We are encouraged by the efforts of the United Nations system to integrate women into the mainstream of national life by emphasizing that women are active participants in development as well as prime beneficiaries of its rewards. My country strongly supports the work of the United Nations on behalf of the advancement of women. We take pride in the fact that the Nairobi forward—Looking strategies for the advancement of women to the year 2000 have been included in the Philippines' medium-term development plan for 1987-1992.During this session the United Nations will observe the tenth anniversary of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). UNIFEM has contributed much to the improvement of the situation of the poor in more than 100 countries around the world. We must therefore continue to support it fully.The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  under the presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia Dr. Mahathir Mohamed  which was held in Vienna in June  was a landmark development in international co-operation in meeting the grave challenge of the drug problem. The Declaration and the comprehensive multi-disciplinary outline should lay the groundwork for further co-operation. The Philippines will continue to pursue the fight against that scourge  both at home and on the international front  particularly in collaboration with its partners In the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) .In its latest compilation the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 58 880 cases of AIDS. The Philippines views with concern the ever-increasing number of victims of that dreaded disease and is therefore prepared to support concerted joint efforts aimed at combating it. One of the most important documents that will be discussed by the General Assembly this year is the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development# entitled ""Our common future"". The Philippines was privileged to attend the presentational meeting to launch the report  which was held in New Deli in July 1987. The realities of living on one Earth make us realize the constraints of the interdependency of our environments and economies. Unfortunately  the international community has not effectively addressed our urgent ecological concerns. Scientists throughout the world have brought to our attention the urgent but complex environmental problems threatening our survival. A warming globe  threats to the ozone layer  desertification  deforestation  pollution and environmental degradation are eroding the potential for development and have become a survival issue for developing countries.Let us recall with relief and gratitude that the forty-first session of the General Assembly ended with a renewed awareness of the need to overcome a looming crisis of confidence in the United Nations and to keep it moving forward despite a serious challenge to its very existence. The difficult situation created by the financial crisis in the United Nations system last year resulted in an unexpected bonus; it gave rise to a pervasive spirit of moderation and sobriety  which culminated in an earnest search for compromise and accommodation.It is imperative for the entire membership to accept joint responsibility for keeping the United Nations not only alive and well but strong enough to face the tasks that have been entrusted to it. Obligations under the Charter must be met under the mandated arrangement of equitable burden-sharing based on capacity. The financial problem will remain and perhaps grow worse for as long as commitments are not honoured.The administrative reforms directed by this Assembly and carried out by the Secretary-General should meet the requirements of rationalization and the need to streamline management. There is encouraging progress in the effort to review the Charter so as to strengthen the United Nations and make it a more effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security.The vision that emerged for all mankind in 1945 in San Francisco will remain as a beacon in our quest for a better life in a world at peace. It is less important to know whether in the interval we have moved an inch closer to our goal than it is to make certain that our sense of commitment and responsibility has not diminished. The important thing is not to falter and not to surrender to cynicism and despair  for if we ate today a community of nations risen from the scourge of wars and deprivation it is because of our awareness that we can gather strength from a sense of solidarity and are nourished by a real faith in the vision of a bright future for mankind as we bestride the short distance into the twenty-first century.

"113",5631,"PNG",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea I have the honour to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the important post of President of the General Assembly at this session. My delegation shares the confidence that the members of this august body have placed in your leadership. Let me assure you of my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of the high duties entrusted to you.I wish to take this opportunity to record my country's appreciation of your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury for a job well done. We were impressed by the manner in which he conducted the work of the General Assembly at its last session.My delegation also commends the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his unwavering efforts in upholding the principles and purposes set forth in the United Nations Charter. His report (A/42/1)  which we have studied with great interest  will make an important contribution to our deliberations. My Government's policy of independent commitment to international co-operation includes a firm commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. For all countries  regardless of size  wealth or might  the United Nations is an Organization we all need despite some of the problems and challenges it faces. The United Nations bears the banner of hope for international co-operation based on mutual respect.My delegation views with serious concern the track record of the United Nations Security Council. We believe there is a need to desensitise the role of the Council because  more often than not  it has failed to live up to the high expectations placed on it. The increasing tendency for the Security Council to be used as a forum for East-West power brokerage is most unsatisfactory. My  Government is concerned that the United Nations should be held hostage to such trends. Furthermore we support the calls for an increase in the number of permanent seats in the Security Council. The provisions regarding the veto should also be reviewed in order to fully protect and promote the principles and purposes set forth in the United Nations Charter.The complex issues of South Africa/ Namibia  the Middle East/ Kampuchea/ Afghanistan/ the Korean Peninsula/ the Iran-Iraq conflict/ the situations in Cyprus and Central America all require genuine efforts on the part of all concerned for their resolution.It is evident that some among us are prepared to allow the situation in South Africa to continue/ the struggle for a Palestinian homeland to continue/ and the I ran-Iraq war to continue.The situation in Kampuchea remains unresolved. The narrow self-interest and indifference on the part of some Members of this Organization are deplorable.Since the adoption of the historic I960 Declaration on decolonization/ many countries  including my own  have attained independence. The concerns which brought about the 1960 Declaration still exist today. Although the number of colonial territories has decreased/ there are some who still continue to suffer the indignities of colonialism.The United Nations has before it the important task of bringing these situations to an end. The colonialists/ and those who benefit from the outdated legacy of colonialism continue to do so without the slightest sign of a sense of guilt.Namibia continues to be subjected to the worst form of colonialism. Its resources are plundered. The overwhelming international support for Namibian independence has not moved South Africa and the other sponsors of colonialism in that territory. When will those who collaborate with South Africa come to realize that their actions and self-serving policies perpetuate South Africa's policy of apartheid?We commend SWAPO for its fine leadership in the struggle for Namibia's independence. We express our solidarity with the people of Namibia and appeal to all to unite in the struggle to achieve the ultimate aim of independence. Whether it be in Namibia  New Caledonia or in any other of the remaining colonial territories  the colonialists and those who collaborate with them advance untenable arguments to defend their interests. Some who ought to know better because they too were victims of colonialism readily subscribe to such absurdities.It is of great concern to my country that the process of decolonization in the Pacific has not been completed. The situation in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands  especially that in Palau  causes some degree of uncertainty and apprehension. We urge the Administering Authority to ensure that the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement is achieved as soon as possible  and is consistent with the aspirations of the people of that Territory.May I be permitted  on behalf of my Government  to applaud the members of this august body who demonstrated their solidarity with the people of New Caledonia and said ""No"" to colonialism during the last session of the General Assembly. Many said ""No"" to colonialism when they gave their support to General Assembly resolution 41/41 A by which New Caledonia was re-inscribed on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Those who stood up to be counted for the principles they believe in did so despite enormous economic and political pressures.In this day and age there is no defence for colonialism. It is my delegation's hope that those who gave France the benefit of the doubt will now come out in support of self-determination and independence for New Caledonia. The current situation in New Caledonia is one of great uncertainty. France refuses to co-operate with the United Nations  thereby reneging on the responsibilities entrusted to it under the Charter as an Administering Authority. Such disregard for an important responsibility is most regrettable for a country which occupies a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and boasts of its democratic institutions. The people of New Caledonia  particularly the indigenous people  the Kanaks  are determined to secure independence for themselves with the guidance of the United Nations.To ensure a legitimate and genuine act of self-determination  France must address the important issue of franchise. Without doing so  any act of self-determination would be meaningless. The countries members of the South Pacific Forum are as determined as ever to see New Caledonia exercise its right to self-determination and gain independence in accordance with the principles and practices of the United Nations. We ask for no more and no less.We appeal to France to honour its obligations under the United Nations Charter as an administering Power to decolonise New Caledonia in co-operation with the United Nations. France must come to terms with the fact that the independence of New Caledonia is inevitable and that the responsibility for achieving that end peacefully rests with the Administering Authority.Papua New Guinea stands firm with the South Pacific Forum countries in our condemnation of the so-called referendum which the French Government staged on 13 September of this year in New Caledonia  an exercise which the Kanak people have rejected outright. The French-sponsored referendum in New Caledonia proved nothing and achieved nothing. It has created more tension in New Caledonia and within the region. The boycott of the referendum by the indigenous people showed the strength of their determination to attain their independence from France. Papua New Guinea's relations with countries and organizations in the South Pacific and South-East Asia are among those we regard to be of primary concern to our country. Papua New Guinea is an active participant in South Pacific affairs through major regional organizations  particularly the South Pacific Forum and its related bodies.Countries of the South Pacific have important economic links with the European Economic Community  Japan  the United States of America  Australia and New Zealand. We welcome the contribution these countries make in promoting economic development in our region.The region's relations with other countries in the North Pacific  including China  the Soviet Union and South Korea  are becoming stronger and more diverse. There are changing trends in the Pacific. Our region is gaining more attention from other countries and organizations than in the past. Papua New Guinea highly values its relations with the South Pacific Area and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) . Both organizations play a constructive role in promoting understanding and co-operation among countries within these two regions and beyond. Countries of the South Pacific are keen to promote a stable and peaceful environment that is conducive to economic advancement by all Pacific Island communities.We welcome the constructive involvement of other countries and international organizations in the South Pacific. Their involvement should recognize the special problems of island countries in the Pacific  and their legitimate interests  particularly in advancing economic co-operation.My Government's priority since taking office has been to stimulate economic development in the country and to improve the welfare of our people. Our efforts to achieve results to large a extent depends on conditions in the wider international environment. We are not immune from the influences of the world economy  especially the trend towards restrictive trade  fluctuations in the prices for commodities  and the slowdown in the flow of capital resources from developed countries to developing countries. Efforts to promote the cause of international co-operation are not meaningful unless they address such vital issues which directly bear on the livelihood of our people. The recent important International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development highlights the increasing need to make better use of available resources for the benefit of mankind  and not for destruction. Like other developing countries  we see the need for urgent measures to be taken to improve and liberalize international trading arrangements  particularly with the major trading nations  and to stimulate the flow of capital resources to promote economic development in developing countries. Urgent measures are also required to alleviate the rising debt crisis. We welcome the recent conclusion of the multilateral fisheries agreement between South Pacific countries and the United States of America. It will contribute towards economic development in our region. We also welcome the interest shown by other countries towards the South Pacific. Development assistance arrangements should be for the purpose of contributing to the social and economic development of the South Pacific countries  and not for other reasons or motives.Any substantial progress towards arms control and disarmament must necessarily begin with the two super-Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  accompanied by complementary efforts by nuclear-weapon States. Without such undertakings  world disarmament efforts will fall far short of expectations. The initiatives and dialogue now underway between the United States and the Soviet Union on disarmament are encouraging. Like most countries  we are anxious to see progress made in this area  which will lead to concrete results. My Government believes that confidence building and resolution of regional conflicts can contribute greatly to an environment conducive for disarmament.The South Pacific is also not immune from nuclear activities. Countries of the South Pacific have taken a step forward in seeking to prevent nuclear activities in the region. A South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty has been concluded between countries of the region  and nuclear-weapon States have been invited to sign related protocols concerning the operations of the arrangement.In late 198b  a Convention for the protection and development of the natural resources and environment of the South Pacific was concluded  and is now open for signature.We commend the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union for their positive responses in signing the protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. We call on other nuclear-weapon states to act positively and also sign those protocols. Despite these initiatives I have outlined above  one country  France  which is involved in our region  still chooses to defy common regional endeavours  from nuclear testing in Polynesia  together with increased militarization of New Caledonia  and intimidation of the indigenous people  the Kanaks  in New Caledonia  are a great source of tension and insecurity within the South Pacific. Like other countries  Papua New Guinea remains totally opposed to French nuclear testing in Polynesia. We call for an immediate halt to French nuclear testing in the Pacific and for that country to respect the efforts of the countries of the South Pacific to keep the region nuclear free  and for the environment and natural resources of that region to be developed for the benefit of the people of our region.We can only encourage negotiation and conclusion of other nuclear-free zones in other parts of the world. The situation in Kampuchea continues to pose a threat to regional peace and stability. The situation is further exacerbated by the continuing presence of foreign forces in Kampuchea against the wishes of the people of that country. Total withdrawal of foreign troops must take place to enable the people of Kampuchea to choose democratically their own government  without outside interference  subversion or coercion. We appeal to the different political factions in Kampuchea to remain united for the common objective of seeking to regain the sovereign entity of Kampuchea. My Government commends ASEAN for its abiding interest and dedication in trying to promote a peaceful resolution to the problems faced by Kampuchea.On the southern tip of Africa the evils of apartheid continue to take their toll. The Papua New Guinea Government shares the view that a comprehensive system of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa is the most effective peaceful means available to the international community to bring about an end to apartheid. The world has already witnessed an escalation of violence and bloodshed  of inhuman treatment towards fellow human beings.The problem of South Africa has become a subject of policy experiments and of hollow rhetoric  and thus an end to apartheid remains an urgent and unfulfilled obligation for the international community. Those who are able to help reverse the situation in South Africa continue to find endless excuses and shirk their responsibilities.We appeal to those who have the capacity to influence democratic changes in South Africa to demonstrate the necessary political will  and in solidarity with the international community  dismantle apartheid.In this respect  the Security Council has an urgent task in fulfilling its responsibility to ensure peace and security in South Africa. The Security Council has demonstrated its unity of purpose on the Iran-Iraq conflict j and we expect it to demonstrate a similar spirit in resolving the problems of apartheid in South Africa.I have outlined my Government's views on only a number of issues listed on the agenda of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. In so doing  my delegation does not in any way ignore the importance and urgency of other issues before this session. The many complex problems and challenges confronting the international community require genuine efforts and commitment by all States Members of the United Nations in the search for acceptable solutions. Papua New Guinea supports a strengthened United Nations system so that it can fulfil its mandate as well as the high expectations of member countries. My country is committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. "
"114",5677,"POL",42,1987,"﻿The peoples of the world are turning towards our Organization with interest  expectations and hopes that are higher than ever before. There is a widespread  growing conviction that mankind will be able to survive and solve its problems only through joint efforts  with the participation of the United Nations.Like every other Member State/ Poland is shouldering  to the extent of its strength and aspirations  its share of responsibility for our shared world-We welcomed with appreciation and hope the historic tentative agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States on the elimination of medium- and shorter-range missiles  as stressed by the President of the Council of State of Poland  Wojciech Jaruzelski  who stated that ""The Polish people  which in its history has had such painful experience of the horrors of war  fully understands the significance of this momentous event  and wholeheartedly endorses it-""We view the Washington agreement as a breakthrough in disarmament negotiationsand as a step towards general and complete disarmament- We see it as an opportunity considerably to accelerate the long efforts to establish lasting peace and security and as the start of a new period  when we can begin to defuse the dangers facing our planet  which is excessively charged with explosives. But we know full well that the long-awaited elimination of two classes of deadly missiles is but the beginning of the long road back from the edge of the abyss to which nuclear weapons have brought mankind.We want to believe that the Soviet-United States agreement will provide a strong impetus for stepping up disarmament negotiations and making progress in the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons based on full compliance with the anti-ballistic missile Treaty. We expect early finalization of an agreement banning chemical weapons. On the agenda as well are negotiations on the elimination from Europe of nuclear weapons with a range of up to 500 kilometres and on a reduction of conventional weapons. The world must take a deep breath and rid itself of the political  psychological  economic and social burden of the arms race.We are deeply convinced of the responsibility of all States  be they large  medium-sized or small  for the future of the world  and of their potential to make a contribution to that future. On many occasions  Poland has spoken out constructively in favour of creating optimal conditions for the peaceful and safe development of our country  of Europe and of the world at large. We have always been aware  however  that the right of a country to security is not without limits. Precisely 30 years ago today  the same philosophy gave rise to the Rapacki plan presented from this rostrum by the then Foreign Minister of Poland on 2 October 1957. The aim of that celebrated initiative was to reduce armaments in the flash-point of Europe and give that region a special status of military security.At that time Poland was trying to break the habit of thinking of security exclusively in East-West terms. Its proposal covered States belonging to both of the two major military blocs and thus reflected the interests of the whole of Europe. Without abandoning global solutions it pointed to the possibility of regional arrangements.The ideas of the Rapacki plan remain valid. Unfortunately  they failed to materialize in Europe  to the detriment of that continent and of the world. But they have inspired statesmen and whole nations to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in Latin America  the South Pacific  Africa and Asia. Thousands of towns and cities on all continents have declared themselves to be nuclear-weapon-free zones. Under international agreements  the Antarctic  outer space and the sea-bed and ocean floor are zones free from those lethal engines. Today  30 years after the Rapacki plan was put forward  the new positive transformation of the world is benefiting from the Polish initiative on decreasing armaments and increasing confidence in Central Europe: the Jaruzelski plan. The plan's underlying idea is to halt the arras race and promote confidence in the militarily most sensitive region of Europe: Central Europe. The Jaruzelski plan stems from Poland's national experience  from the traditions of a nation to which history has meted out harsh treatment. At the same time  the plan serves the interests of other peoples and other States of Europe. Although it refers to a single continent  it approaches the issue of security in broader terms. For that reason  it is our duty to set out here in the United Nations its principles and its substance.First  however  I should like to draw the attention of members to broader issues that have had an impact on the sources  the essence and the shape of that Polish initiative.We believe it is time to end the very dangerous role of the military factor in the contemporary world. Now  at the end of the twentieth century  there is no place for policies based on military means and on dealing from a position of strength. That underlies the initiatives taken by States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. The essence of those initiatives are; the elimination of conventional armed forces and weapons] the complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests  the prevention of the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space; a ban on chemical weapons; the inadmissibility of the use of military means in the resolution of any dispute; and the corresponding modification of military doctrines. These initiatives are well balanced and open  and are born of the conviction that one cannot build one's own security at the expense of the security of others. The current general debate at the forty-second session of the General Assembly demonstrates that this conviction is shared by a growing number of States. We hope that in the interest of their own peoples  and in accordance with the expectations of the international community  the States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will respond to the disarmament offer of the Warsaw Treaty organization.Progress in disarmament must have priority in the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations.The consistency and flexibility with which the Soviet Union - in the United Nations and elsewhere - is addressing the implementation of the programme for ridding the world of nuclear weapons by the year 2000 deserves the highest respect and attention. That programme spells out the desires of all mankind.Mankind's peaceful efforts and expectations manifest the conviction that the unity and harmonious growth of the world require acceptance of the simple truth that the interests of particular regions are part and parcel of the global interests of all nations. The world can develop  nationally and regionally  only with acknowledgement of the political and economic diversity of States and regions  and with mutual co-operation  understanding and respect. Guided by those considerations we  together with other socialist States  have proposed the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security. We should like it to embrace the most important manifestations of the interests of all mankind  be they military  political  economic  humanitarian or environmental in nature. In an era of ominous nuclear armaments and advanced space research  it is our objective and desire to ensure  for every nation and every individual  through the collective efforts of the international community  the right to life  freedom  peace  prosperity and happiness. Only in this way can we meet the deep concern for the realization  in present-day practice of international relations  of the lofty purposes and principles of the United Nations set forth in the Charter  due account being taken of the new values created in the past four decades and of mutual interdependence and common dangers. That was stressed by Mikhail Gorbachev in his recent article on the realities and guarantees of a safe world. In such a system of international peace and security we also see room for putting into effect the fundamental objectives of Poland's foreign policy. In Europe  in the region closest to Poland  the main problem of security now is  in effect  eliminating the possibility of a surprise attack. One can no longer walk around the European powder-keg with a lighted match  for sooner or later an explosion is bound to occur with incalculable consequences for the whole world.Political  economic and cultural relations in Europe  especially those related to the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)   do not warrant the current high level of armaments and military preparedness. In the area of Central Europe closest to my homeland  stockpiles of weapons have been amassed far exceeding the defence needs of countries of the region. It is with some concern and anxiety that we wonder about the future of European security after the elimination of medium- and shorter-range missiles. Will this really be the starting-point for genuine disarmament  detente and the building of lasting confidence or  on the contrary  for increased conventional armaments and the growth in stockpiles of tactical nuclear weapons?It is our deepest conviction that favourable conditions exist for ensuring greater security for European States at a considerably lower level of military potential. This conviction is fully reflected in the Jaruzelski plan. It proposes  among other things  the gradual reduction and withdrawal of specific  mutually agreed on  types and quantities of nuclear and conventional weapons and agreement on the elimination of the disproportions and asymmetries in a variety of weapons and armed forces  together possibly with reductions in areas where one side enjoys superiority over the other. Those steps should be matched by appropriate and far-reaching confidence-building and security-building measures  along with a mechanism for thorough verification. The plan also proposes such modification of military doctrines that they would reciprocally be recognized as strictly defensive. The steps taken within the framework of the plan would be based on the principles of equality of rights  reciprocity  equal security of all patties without detriment to the security of any one State.Appropriate guarantees by nuclear Powers could be one of the conditions for the effectiveness of the measures envisaged in the plan  as well as the security of the States of the region  and respect for their status under the agreement.The Polish plan is open in nature. It provides genuine possibilities for the partners jointly to select and spell out the means of implementation and to take into account the suggestions and proposals of all the interested States. It is a manifestation of the concept of achieving common security through the co-operation of States We also support the proposals made by Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free corridor and a chemical-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.We take note with satisfaction of the finalization of the study of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research on the diverse effects of the militarization of outer space  which was the goal of the Polish initiative submitted at the fortieth session of the General Assembly.The sense of security is deeply rooted in the minds of men and stems from the most profound motivations and aspirations for peace as man's supreme value. It is from that standpoint that we approach the third periodic review of the implementation of the United Nations  Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace  adopted on Poland's initiative· In our view the Declaration fulfils its role. This has been confirmed  inter alia  by observances of the International Year of Peace and the massive demands for real disarmament measures voiced then with unprecedented strength· World public opinion has unequivocally confirmed the determination of nations to ensure peace and their readiness to act to strengthen it. In the view of the Polish government  the provisions of the Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace could play a greater role if their implementation were not entirely discretionary. Therefore we suggest that the General Assembly consider the need and possibility of upgrading the international status of that important document.According greater priority within the United Nations system to solving humanity’ s critical social problems  which are the source of many international tensions  would constitute an appropriate and welcome step towards a more secure world. The Conference of the European ministers responsible for social affairs held in Warsaw last April  served precisely that purpose. Respect for human rights constitutes an integral element of the system of international security. We are pleased that the international community is showing increasing appreciation of the need to humanize international relations. In keeping with the ideals of the United Nations Charter  that stand should lead to a perception of the world as a single entity  the development of which is determined by the interests of mankind and the democratisation of international relations.The implementation of such a humanist view is served  not only by disarmament and broad international co-operation  but by human rights. We have established  within the United Nations system and on a regional scale within the CSCE process  a common basis for realizing those objectives; the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  and other relevant documents demonstrate that. We are in favour of their full and creative application by all States. However  they cannot be approached in a selective manner. In the global effort to enhance human rights  greater attention should be devoted to social and economic rights  and access to culture  education and health care. We are also in favour of greater integration of human rights into social development.Poland supports specific international co-operation and serious discussion in the field of human rights. Accordingly  we have  for instance  supported the proposal to convene in Moscow a broadly representative conference on humanitarian co-operation between the States participants in the CSCE process. We have accumulated many positive experiences that we are prepared to share. We do not shy away from taking into account the experience of others provided that such experience is in keeping with mutually recognized values  national traditions and needs. We intend to go further in enhancing human rights and achieving national reconciliation  renewal  ever greater democratisation of social relations and the development of socialist pluralism. Aware of the role of the family in the social life of nations and States  we have submitted to the Commission for Social Development a draft resolution on the proclamation by the United Nations of an International year of family· We expect that year to be proclaimed for the early 1990s. We view the strengthening of the family as the basic social cell and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and as a concrete contribution to the development of common values for the sake of the present as well as the future of mankind.We are confident that our initiative  which has also been sponsored by Austria  Canada  Mongolia  Portugal  the Federal Republic of Germany and the Ukraine  and which enjoys the support of many other States  will receive unanimous approval at the current session of the General Assembly.The comprehensive system of international peace and security proposed by the socialist States means also that greater attention should be devoted to economic growth. A situation which for some nations is tantamount to bare survival while for others it means that they do not know what to do with their surplus goods cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely· At a time of considerable growth in international economic interdependence  the establishment of a system of international economic security becomes a fundamental challenge. It is urgently necessary that the efforts of the United Nations be concentrated on ensuring decent and equitable development conditions for all States. The more developed participants in the international economic exchange can no longer treat weaker partners in a condescending manner. Today the latter are already indispensable parties to the development process of the more developed countries  and this will be even more true in the future. The narrowly conceived interests and short-term benefits of the developed countries should not obscure the broader and more fundamental interests resulting from the growing interdependence of all countries. Poland has consistently supported the building of confidence in international economic relations and has put into effect the concept of international economic security and stable international co-operation  free from restrictions and limitations. We ate ready to co-operate with all those that wish to co-operate with us on an equal basis. This means desisting from attempts to lecture others and to impose one's solutions on others. Attempts to make the capitalist market economy the only panacea for all the difficulties and problems of the contemporary world are naive and at odds with the interests of international co-operation. Each nation enjoys the right to choose the path to development which is in keeping with its own interests and historical processes. Entrepreneurship and the free market are not inventions of the capitalist economy alone.Today economic security is inseparably linked to foreign indebtedness  which has become an issue of global dimensions. The credits received  instead of enhancing the development of debtor countries  are frequently impeding it. Equally frequently they become instruments of political pressure against those States which  for many reasons  are unable to repay their debt. This phenomenon is not limited to the developing countries. At the present time  in this closely interdependent world  indebtedness affects the interests not only of the debtor States but also of the creditors. The latter  in their own best interest  should support the restructuring efforts of the debtor countries and lower the cost of debt servicing. We have been drawing attention to this situation for some time  inter alia by proposing at the fortieth session of the General Assembly that an international debt and development research centre be established under the auspices of the Secretary-General  With a view to facilitating the implementation of this initiative  we set up in Krakow at the end of 1986 a national centre devoted to dealing with these problems. I express the hope that the centre will shortly be associated with the programmes carried out within the framework of the United Nations system.Poland has also been actively involved in international efforts aimed at increasing the resources allocated for development. Like the overwhelming majority of States  we believe that one of the principal sources of development funds should be the resources which are today squandered on armaments. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which was held in September  has confirmed the existence of an inseparable link between disarmament and development. We believe that disarmament is a prerequisite for development. The reallocation of resources obtained as a result of arms reduction should not be carried out automatically. It should take due account also of the level and requirements of the internal development of States  reducing military expenditures and promoting co-operation with the developing countries.The building of a secure and better world will not be possible without stopping the continuing degradation of man's natural environment. Poland attaches major importance to ecological issues. We seek to expand international co-operation in this area. It is with great attention that we have acquainted ourselves with the valuable report of the World Commission on Environment and Development headed by the Prime Minister of Norway  Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland. We expect that  in keeping with Poland's proposal submitted at the fortieth session of the General Assembly  an increased exchange of environmental protection technology will follow. The resolution adopted at the Conference of the United Nations Environment Programme in Nairobi marked a degree of progress in that area. We hope that the General Assembly  too  will take constructive steps in this regard  at the current session. Poland supports efforts designed to eliminate the threat to the security of States and individuals posed by international terrorism. We are ready to participate in the establishment of effective international barriers against this dangerous phenomenon. These efforts  however  cannot in any way cause us to disregard the legitimate national liberation struggles that stem from the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination. To the extent of our possibilities  we are also endeavouring to contribute to the struggle against the deadly diseases of our day and to finding more effective means of containing drug abuse and preventing the spread of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).I have referred to only some of the roost critical aspects of the building of a more secure and better world. Poland has stressed on many occasions  however  that there cannot be a more secure world without the peaceful resolution of regional conflict situations: in the Middle East  on the basis of the return of the occupied territories and respect for the right of all peoples to self-determination·  in southern Africa  through the elimination of apartheid and the exercise of the right of the people of Namibia to self-determination; around Afghanistan and Kampuchea  with the implementation of the policy of national reconciliation and dialogue with the States concerned; in Central America  with respect for the original initiative of the States of the region; in Europe  with a settlement of the Cyprus problem; and in the Korean peninsula  with the peaceful reunification of the Korean people in accordance with the proposals of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. There will be no safe world without the cessation of hostilities between Iraq and Iran and the solution of the contentious issues between those two States on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) . All States should refrain from unilateral actions and extend resolute support to the Security Council and the Secretary-General. As in past years  we are ready to take part in practical steps aimed at restoring peace to the sensitive regions of the world.True to the fundamental premises of its policy and the principles of the United Nations Charter  Poland is interested in the promotion of relations with all States based on the principles of equality  non-interference in internal affairs and mutual benefit. It is with satisfaction that we take note of the speeding up of positive changes in Polish-American relations. The reopening of the political dialogue and its elevation to higher levels  as well as the lifting of United States restrictions  have paved the way for the normalization and improvement of bilateral relations. We have travelled together a long way  from crisis situations to joint constructive actions  gradually restoring normal relations based on a lasting foundation and universally recognized principles  for the benefit of our nations  peace and international co-operation.The development of this process calls for new efforts to overcome the obstacles and impediments that still exist. We wish relations between Poland and the United States to be normal and businesslike  based on peaceful coexistence and the rich traditions which bind our two peoples. We are ready for new joint constructive steps in political relations  equitable economic and financial co-operation and cultural  scientific and technological exchanges.Similarly  it is our desire to promote mutually advantageous contacts with other Western States. We think that substantial progress in the normalization of relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of the 1970 Treaty would constitute a joint contribution to tine strengthening of positive trends  and not only in Europe. We took careful note of the statement of Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on the ""special quality"" of relations with Poland.All the problems that I have touched upon can be solved through full application of the principles and ideals set out in the Charter of the United Nations. To attain this goal it is indispensable to strengthen our Organization. We must enhance its effectiveness  especially in the key areas of the consolidation of peace  international security  arras control  disarmament and development. We appreciate the efforts of the Organization and its Secretary-General in easing tension and eliminating regional conflicts. A substantial contribution to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the world is being made by efforts concerning the codification and progressive development of international law  in particular those of the International Law Commission.In conclusion  it is with deep satisfaction that I greet in the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session the representative of the German Democratic Republic  a brother socialist country to which Poland is linked by ties of friendship and co-operation  as well as by a lasting and unalterable boundary of peace between two friendly sovereign States. At the same time  I should like to extend to the Secretary-General  Mr· Javier Perez de Cuellar  an assurance of our unswerving respect and our support for his endeavours.Poland firmly believes that the United Nations offers the best platform for joining words to deeds in inter-State relations and in the peaceful resolution of the basic dilemmas of our times- At the time when we founded this Organization together we were equally convinced of the validity of this statement. This is borne out by the fact that Poland  foreign policy is fully in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations; this has found its expression in  among other things  the Jaruzelski plan  as explained today to the General AssemblyWe are deeply convinced that the constructive  comprehensive nature of the present debate will contribute to the strengthening of the role and significance of the United Nations in the quest for a better  safer  peaceful world."
"115",5748,"PRT",42,1987,"﻿First of all  allow me to congratulate the President on his election to such an eminent post. We are certain that his well-known merits will be a decisive contribution to the success of the work of this forty-second session of the General Assembly. Likewise  I should like to pay tribute to the outgoing President Mr. Rasheed Choudhury  for the competent manner in which he carried out the duties of the presidency.In such a troubled period of international life  it is for me a special pleasure to address this Assembly as Foreign Minister of a Government which  under the leadership of Professor Cavaco Silva  was able to find for Portugal a balance between political stability and economic and social development and the fulfilment of the ideals of freedom  democracy and solidarity.These have been  after all  important goals of the United Nations ever since its creation 40 years ago  and they have become a constant source of inspiration to Governments and men of good will. The United Nations has acquired a long and rich experience as a mediator.This is no less remarkable than its ability at the same time to preserve  over and above everything else  a legitimacy of its own that defines it as the irreplaceable instrument for co-operation and understanding among the peoples that make up the Organization.	·I have already referred to the role of mediator played by this Organization and its contribution to the settlement of conflicts. However  I am pleased to mention here an example where calling upon this role was not needed and an exclusively bilateral settlement was reached  thanks to the understanding among nations and to their good will in the search for a solution of their differences.I am referring to the agreement signed between the People's Republic of China and Portugal on 13 April 1987  establishing the necessary conditions for the transfer of the exercise of sovereignty over the territory of Macao  to begin inIt should be noted that from the beginning of such negotiations there was no dispute over the title of sovereignty  which the Portuguese Constitution of 1976 had already acknowledged as belonging to China. Tribute should be paid not only to the conditions embodied in this agreement but also to the atmosphere of good understanding that prevailed throughout these negotiations and allowed for the safeguarding and strengthening of the bonds of friendship and co-operation that already existed between our two countries. The perspectives are now opened in our relations with the great nation of China.Nevertheless  there are instances in which countries should  or have to  resort to the mechanisms established in the Charter of this Organization in order to look for an equitable settlement of disputes. This was the case of Portugal in relation to East Timor. Unable to fulfil its obligation as the administering power and  in view of there having been no practical results after seven years of condemnation of the occupation of the Territory by Indonesian forces  Portugal decided to request the intervention of the Secretary-General.We are still relying on the mandate under which the General Assembly  in resolution 37/30 in 1982  requested the Secretary-General to search for an equitable  universal and internationally acceptable solution to the question o East Timor. Further consultations and useful contacts have been carried out w thin the framework of that mandate  keeping the dialogue open in the hope of reaching positive results. Hence  we have agreed once again to the postponement of the debate called by the General Assembly  in view of the progress report of the Secretary-General issued on 8 September.Our sincere disposition actively to co-operate in the fulfilment of the mandate carried out by the Secretary-General is based  as we repeatedly stated  on clear-cut underlying principles: the absence of any sort of claim over the territory of Timor  which is closely linked to us by historical bonds  the search for a dignified settlement that will respect the religious and cultural identity of the people of Timor  and the fulfilment of its legitimate aspirations} respect for the right of the people of East Timor and of any other people freely to decide upon its collective destiny in full compliance with the fundamental and unquestionable principle of self-determination  in accordance with resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV) of the General Assembly of the United Nations.My Government pays particular attention to the measures affecting the humanitarian conditions of the people of East Timor and sincerely welcomes the Secretary-General's intention closely to follow such developments ""so as to promote future and constant improvements in the conditions of the Territory"".Therefore we participated in the work recently carried out in Geneva by the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and the Protection of Minorities  which  in the framework of the issue of the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms  approved a resolution on the situation in East Timor.Portugal has recently been elected by the Economic and Social Council to membership in the Human Rights Commission. As an applicant  my country was fully aware of the particular responsibilities entailed in such membership. But it was likewise inspired by the possibility of making a more decisive contribution in this field since human rights are one of the main items of Portuguese foreign policy.We cannot talk about human rights without bearing in mind that in many areas of the world millions of people are still denied safeguard of the most fundamental fight  the right to life. We firmly believe that international peace and security  as well as the social and economic development and progress of the different nations  can be fully achieved and safeguarded only if they are based upon resolute implementation of human rights  social justice and each individual's freedom to choose and pave his own destiny.Since we firmly believe in these principles  we cannot share the misleading concept that State sovereignty can be invoked to prevent international safeguards of human rights  not even if lack of social and economic development is used to justify lesser observance of and respect for civil and political rights. On the contrary  the implementation of human rights should  in our opinion  be a primary concern in the assessment of the major problems that afflict the international environment today.In this regard we cannot stress enough the paramount importance of the role that the United Nations and its several organs and specialized agencies have Ь en playing and should continue to play. Important legislative work is being caned out based upon the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As a parallel development  we believe that the international community should embark on a concerted effort to reinforce the systems of surveillance and verification of the implementation of human rights. Measures like the appointment of special rapporteurs  the creation of task forces  the presentation of reports  the organization of international conferences an< congresses on specific subjects or specific cases of presumable violation of human rights  wherever they may occur  have proved to be fruitful and should be pro 3ted and reinforced in the future. I should like also to acknowledge the important role played by non-governmental organizations since safeguard of human rights is a task that we should all embrace and one that affects us all.In the same framework please allow me briefly to refer to another subject of increasing concern in today's world  namely  the systematic practise of violent acts carried out by organized groups that do not respect the democratic order prevailing in our countries. These actions  no matter who perpetrates them or why  directly jeopardize personal rights  freedoms and safeguards  such as the rights to life  to freedom and to security.For these reasons we have always upheld adherence to and full respect for the spirit and letter of the conventions drawn up by the specialized agencies within the United Nations system  similarly we positively support the consensus expressed by the approval of resolution 40/61 of 9 December 1985. That agreement deserves our tribute inasmuch as it was the first time that a consensus was reached on such a difficult issue having such a wide range of implications  and we are firmly convinced that we should pursue actions in accordance with the spirit of such a resolution  in our opinion  this is a problem that  given its gravity and urgency  should be carefully addressed by the whole international community.On 1 July this year the European Communities took a significant step forward in the process of a new European development; the enforcement of the European Single Act.Portugal considers this initiative  together with the related reforms now under way  to which we have actively contributed  a demonstration of great vitality  it stands for both adaptation to an internal reality to which new elements have added richness as well as diversity and adjustment to the development of the political  economic and technological conditions of the latter years of our century  which are undergoing rapid and profound mutations.We consider that Act a valid attempt to meet coherent challenges that the community will have to face simultaneously; on the one hand an external challenge; on the other  an internal one. Overcoming the external challenge will entail the possibility of reinforcing and giving broader meaning to the constructive position that the Community has been taking on the international scene. The internal challenge entails the need to secure a balanced development process within territorial boundaries  which may allow for the reduction of the existing gap between countries and regions and the reinforcement of internal cohesion·It is essential to find the appropriate solution to both challenges so this the community and its members may  as we all wish fully assume their responsibilities in the political and economic spheres at an international level.After all  there has been a constant effort to achieve international openness and co-operation) evidence of that is provided by the recent revision of the co-operation agreements with the Lomé countries and the southern Mediterranean countries·Along the lines of a policy of co-operation and assistance to development I should like to stress that my country has this year completed its full-fledged adherence to the Third Lomé Convention. This is a framework between the European Economic Community (EEC) and 66 countries of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific  which will allow us considerably to extend our actions to underdeveloped countries and hence reaffirm the bilateral co-operation policy that we have endeavoured to accomplish.I should like to mention here the work carried out by many of the countries that participate in the General Assembly within the ""Uruguay Round"" of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This round of negotiations  broader than any previous one  should attain results leading to a sound change in economic international relations. Portugal is determined actively to contribute to the success of this round of negotiations  and here and now we renew our quest: enable support for the Declaration of Punta del Este. Nevertheless  the success of such negotiations should stem from the concerted action of all the participating countries. Each country’s capacities and a fair distribution of responsibilities should be taken into consideration so as to attain complete transparency regarding artificial protectionism  in international trade. That is the essential basis for the carrying out of structural changes and reforms that lead to the necessary conditions for the optimal use of existing resources. Hence it is appropriate to recall the conclusions of the UNCTAD meeting. In one single document it was possible to express a concerted assessment of the economic international situation and to list a series of specific political actions to be implemented within the next few years by the developed and developing countries. The climate of dialogue achieved during the conference allowed for a sound analysis of multilateral economic co-operation. This is an essential factor in the North-South dialogue  which is such a pivotal item in international relations.It is well known by all that co-operation with Africa  in particular with Portuguese-speaking African countries  is of paramount importance to Portugal. It is for us a crucial matter of top priority at both the political and the cultural levels.The priority attributed to the African coast and to the African continent in the celebrations that Portugal is holding before the turn of the century commemorating the Descobrimentos  the adventure of our maritime expansion and the encounter of peoples and civilizations  speaks for itself.I wish to express here the hope that the United Nations may become involved in these celebrations  a clearly universal event.As many have acknowledged  Portuguese expansion was  as a famous sociologist put it  more of a maritime and exploratory expansion than a conquering one. Cultural roots are deep  and all recognize the special bonds created by such a heritage  for which we are willing to expand and intensify the co-operation and dialogue between Portugal and all African countries that ace Portuguese-speaking or that share our historical heritage. Accordingly  Portugal has undertaken serious efforts to promote our already reinforced common solidarity  and has widely proved that. This co-operation apart from bilateral action in different sectors  also encompasses very valuable multilateral programmes - for example  our participation in the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC)  a body which has achieved year after year increasing political and economic solidarity  giving special priority to the problems of development-Moreover  it is with serious apprehension that Portugal views the series of developments taking place in southern Africa: the considerable deterioration of the social and economic conditions of the population  and the escalating instability and tension· Underlying this situation are two factors that have been vehemently condemned by the international community} the present internal framework of the Republic of south Africa and the deliberately provoked destabilizing outbreaks that have been afflicting countries of the area  namely  Angola and Mozambique.Likewise  Portugal has unequivocally denounced and condemned  both within the United Nations system and elsewhere  the immorality and injustice entailed in apartheid. The dismantlement of apartheid is an essential condition of the achievement of equitable solutions to the conflicts and problems besetting South Africa today.Thus  it is essential that the South African authorities pursue a dialogue with all the political and social groups that try to make a decisive move towards the definite elimination of apartheid and the establishment of conditions that we ensure more effective access to political participation  employment and social justice for all the communities of the country. Only with the courage  decisiveness and true sense of responsibility required at this historic moment w: the governing classes in South Africa avoid a process of internal confrontation.Similarly  Portugal views with great concern the continuous postponement by the Republic of South Africa of the exercise by the Namibian people of the right self-determination. Twenty years after the adoption of resolution 2145 (XXI) which ended South Africa’s Mandate over Namibia  the question of the independence of that Territory is not yet solved  owing to South Attica's persistent demands  which delay the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).Portugal's position in this matter is well known. Portugal has repeatedly declared that the solution of the question of Namibia is of primary concern  and has consistently upheld the independence of the Territory  in keeping with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Portugal has also repeatedly expressed its firm opposition to any act capable of further delaying the attainment by the people of Namibia of their right to self-determination.South Africa should respond constructively to the appeals voiced by the international community and abandon the position of confrontation that it has adopted  particularly against Angola. Portugal has vehemently condemned this position on the part of South Africa.My Government is firmly convinced that the solution to the problems that afflict South Africa lies in the creation of conditions leading to the widening of a genuine and constructive dialogue. This is the spirit of the Nkomati agreements and of the contacts we have carried out in the region. Without pretending to find solutions to problems that others will have to solve  we believe that it is our duty to contribute in the best possible way to a peaceful  concerted settlement of the conflicts that so dramatically beset such important areas of the African continent.It is with deep concern that my country views the constant worsening of the living conditions of the people of Mozambique and the acts of extreme violence t at have recently been perpetrated against them by groups involved in a p spreading instability  which my country vehemently condemns. Angola  too  is living in particularly difficult times. There  too  the population is afflicted by the widespread instability and conflict that prevail in most countries of southern Africa. We pay a tribute to the pragmatism that the political leaders in Angola have demonstrated in their search for a global solution to the problems that afflict the country. Also worthy of praise are the reopening of the dialogue aimed at a solution of the problem of Namibia and the recent announcement of important economic reforms  Portugal firmly supports and encourages such measures.I should also like to address here the recent unanimous election within the United Nations system of a renowned diplomat and legal expert from Cape Verde to the presidency of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  I am certain that with all his merits he will make a decisive contribution to the work of that body  whose success is of great interest to a country with such maritime traditions as Portugal.I should also like to refer with great satisfaction to the views set forth at the last meeting of the five Heads of State of Central America in the city of Guatemala. The results achieved at that meeting are a promising step towards the creation of the atmosphere of mutual confidence which is so essential to the preservation of peace  respect for political freedoms and the social and economic development of the area. Nevertheless  the promise can be kept only if specific actions are taken that will embody the safeguards for the exercise of civil and political rights that are an essential part of the Guatemala document.In spite of the progress achieved in this vast area of America  we remain concerned about the overwhelming need for further efforts so that the serious economic problems that afflict many Latin American countries may be overcome. It is not always easy to make a profound diagnosis of the causes of the problems that affect these countries  but the international community should do away with solutions that have proved to be unsatisfactory and turn to more innovative ideas. I am convinced that the developed countries have an important contribution to make in this area. I firmly believe that we should seek constantly and persistently a new set of formulas for co-operation with Latin America.I also pay a tribute to the increasing solidarity that the Latin American countries have demonstrated. Examples of this solidarity can be found in the endeavours of the Contadora Group and the Support Group - namely  the establishment of a mechanism for periodic political consultations between the member countries of these two groups and of closer contacts between Brazil  Argentina and Uruguay. These measures are the starting point of a process of gradual integration that will have major consequences in the area.I turn to disarmament. I will not dwell on this vast and complex subject  since my colleague from Denmark has already addressed the issue on behalf of all the member countries of the European Communities. I would simply re-emphasize that Portugal will continue to participate actively with the allied countries in all the actions carried of the international community in this field that may lead to effective reinforcement of international security.In our opinion this will occur only in an atmosphere of greater mutual trust  achieved through a continued  sound East-West dialogue  without jeopardizing the delicate balance of power  which in today's world  remains the most solid safeguard of security and stability in international relations.It is in this spirit that we carefully observe the positive developments in the current negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Moreover  I cannot fail to make a special reference to the agreement on the dismantlement of medium-range missiles in Europe achieved recently in Washington. We hope that this measure will contribute not only to a more secure Europe  but also to greater stability and collective safety  which it should never impair. It is with deep concern that we have noted in the last few weeks the deterioration of the situation in the Gulf region. We join whole-heartedly in all the urgent appeals from all corners of the world for an end to all acts of violence and intimidation  so as to achieve a cease-fire in the area as the pre-condition of the establishment of an environment of understanding in which genuine solutions may be found.In accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which is a good example of the unity at present prevailing in the international community  we uphold freedom of navigation and free trade in every part of the world  and cannot accept that principles universally accepted and enshrined in international documents signed by every nation should be jeopardized.We likewise fully support the endeavours of the Secretary-General in the search for peace and a lasting  dignified agreement that may lead to the ending of the conflict that has been undermining Iran and Iraq. We are confident that the Secretary-General's decisiveness may become a crucial element in this issue  as long as both parties prove willing to search for peaceful solutions  without any reservation.As for the conflict between Israel and the Arab countries  we are convinced that underlying the problems faced by the region is the postponement of solutions. Together with other countries of the Common Market  our country will do everything possible to reach realistic  balanced and lasting solutions to this issue  taking into consideration the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the need to withdrawal from occupied Arab territories and recognition of the right of all the nations of the area to peaceful coexistence. It is thus with great hope that we face the reopening of the dialogue between Europe and the Arab countries. We firmly believe that invaluable benefits can stem from a more perfect understanding and more conscientious consultation with the large family of Arab countries.We cannot fail to mention Afghanistan and stress once again the wish of Portugal to see that country  free of the presence of foreign troops and external pressures  find peace  and with that peace be granted the right to self-determination.Another country that has had to bear the occupation of foreign troops for several years now is Kampuchea. In that case also the international community and in particular the Secretary-General should spare no effort in the search for a just and peaceful solution that will safeguard the territorial boundaries and the independence and free will of that people.I began by stating that the ideals embodied in the Charter are still valid today  indeed I consider them part of the goals that move Governments and men: peace  economic and social progress  respect for the individual and the freedom and independence for each nation. It is for this Organization especially the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  in whom we fully trust  to fulfil the difficult mission of continuing and renewing that noble and worthy task.We are confident that lasting solutions to the present financial crisis will be found  solutions that will satisfy all and hence contribute to the support for and prestige of the actions of this forum. Only then will this Organization be able to fulfil its original pledge and play the role that is its tight.In this connection I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his initiatives directed towards a stricter rationalization of expenditure and more efficient management and tighter control of human and financial resources. Such measures  of course  are applicable to the whole United Nations system  including the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  which should not only be subject to a more strict and efficient management but also regain its universal vocation. These were the main reasons that led my country to nominate for the director-generalship of UNESCO a Portuguese whose well-known and undeniable merits would ensure the rapid and effective achievement of those goals.Allow me in conclusion to emphasize again the total devotion of my country to the success of the United Nations as an instrument of peace and progress in the international community."
"116",5794,"PRY",42,1987,"﻿At the outset of my presentation to the General Assembly at its forty-second session  I should like to convey our most respectful greetings to the President  Mr. Peter Florin  representative of the German Democratic Republic  and to express our best wishes for the successful conclusion of our work under his presidency  and the hope that from this session there will emerge important resolutions that would effectively ensure international peace and security.We also extend out greetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whom we ask to accept our appreciation for his tireless dedication to the United Nations goals of peace and development. This Organization is fortunate to have him  not only as its most eminent official  but also as a citizen of the world committed to achieving peace and development for all.The Republic of Paraguay comes once again to this forum with the sincere intention of supporting every initiative that could assure mankind of a day of peace and full development. It does so in the firm belief that each State Member of this Organization  as a servant of international law  is convinced of the importance of the existence of the United Nations and of its role of protagonist in bringing about a time of peace and security for all.In these circumstances  arid considering the role the United Nations should Play in the world  we fail to understand the attitudes of many countries - whether they be super-Powers  permanent members of the Security Council or Members of this Organization - attitudes that undermine  that sap their support and reduce the level of their active participation  thus weakening the Organization's ability to intervene in critical situations. This problem  already one of long standing - the Problem of the lack of a leading role for the United Nations in world conflicts - is totally  the unwarranted. On the contrary  it demands of every country an effective attitude that could redound to the greater  the universal prestige of our Organization and the effective application of our entire legal and moral power for bringing about just solutions to conflicts that  at this very moment  beset humanity.When we review those critical events that have taken place since 1945  we are obliged to say that  because of the aforementioned weakening of the role of the United Nations as a leader  every country should see to it that the decisions taken by the General Assembly  which are adopted to prevent or solve conflicts  are brought into line with true justice and contain positive formulas - pragmatic and fair formulas - capable of resolving crises by peaceful means and achieving effective peace through negotiation. Unilateral  partial decisions  or those that do not embody the immutable principles of international justice  do the United Nations system no good. By contrast  the adoption of decisions on the basis of different criteria - criteria based on world harmony and strict respect for the Charter - could promote a more effective way for our Organization to become involved.The Government of Paraguay wishes to pay a special tribute to all bodies within the United Nations system  but in particular to the United Nations Development Programme  whose activities are related to the progressive accomplishment of all the vital projects that are being implemented in our country. This type of United Nations assistance is not only effective for developing countries like Paraguay  but also serves the ceaseless quest for a better standard of life and progress for all nations.The Republic of Paraguay is continuing to make strides in peace and democracy. It has been doing so steadily since 1954  assuring justice and freedom for all our people. The nation is effectively governed by the rule of law  and thus enables its citizens to develop further and perfect our democratic institutions  guaranteeing a political life based on the widest possible participation and a multi-party system.The Government of the Constitutional President of the Republic of Paraguay  General of the Army Alfredo Stroessner  is based on popular consent  freely expressed in fair elections. It has the popular and democratic support of the Colorado Party  a political organization which  on 11 September 1987  commemorated a hundred years of constitutional life in Paraguay.Throughout its rich history  Paraguay has struggled and made sacrifices to defend the immutable principles of international law. We seek to ensure constant respect for the individual identity and the independence of all States and  in strict reciprocity in our international conduct  we have called on other States faithfully to observe the same principles  never  in any circumstances or in any way whatsoever  accepting interference by other States in the domestic affairs of Paraguay - affairs which are of concern to  and have to be dealt with  only by Paraguayans.We wish to bring to the attention of the General Assembly the spirit of integration that has guided the regional policy of the Republic of Paraguay  a policy based on peace and co-operation with our neighbours. This has made possible the construction of the hydro-electric projects at Itaipu  under conditions of equality of rights and duties  with the Federative Republic of Brazil - projects that are already generating the electricity needed for the development of a vast region. The same applies to the Yacyreta project involving ourselves and Argentina. This project is in an advanced stage of construction. Both demonstrate the serious determination of the Government of Paraguay to make progress. These  added to the facilities provided by our Atlantic neighbours  such as the ports of Paranagua in Brazil  Nueva Palmira in Uruguay  Antofagasta in Chile and Matarani in Peru constitute favourable indicators of our relations with neighbouring sister nations. Our trade with Bolivia is expanding through the Transdhaco route  in harmony with the spirit of that same policy.The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization deserves our fullest support. We know of the Secretary-General's unalterable determination to find a solution to international problems. This report schematically summarize! all the achievements in that difficult field  as well as the frustrations faced as the result of a wide range of intervening factors that are beyond the control of the highest-ranking official of the United Nations.We highlight the work done by the Secretary-General and subscribe to his central  vital concepts  which lead the Organization towards fulfilment of the purposes laid down by the founders of the United Nations  in a changing world beset - by adverse factors  so that peace may be made a tangible reality and fellowship among nations may foster progress and efforts to achieve international justice.We cannot fail to mention the sources of possible world conflicts that are of concern to the Republic of Paraguay and to all mankind - for example  the conflict in the Persian Gulf  which has reached such dangerous proportions that it could a any moment lead to a more widespread war  with incalculable consequences. We believe we speak for men and women throughout the world when we ask the United Nations to make every possible effort to put an end to that hotbed  which has its origin in the war between Iran and Iraq  compounded by a number of factors that imperil world peace. We call upon the States involved in that conflict to accept the decisions of the United Nations. The regrettable escalation of events in Latin America confronts us with evidence of another source of conflicts whose outcome is unpredictable. In this area of the world  there is intervention by two super-Powers with broad interests in the region. The countries of the region that make up the Contadora Group and the Support Group have been working  with our encouragement  to bring about peace. It is essential that peace be achieved and that all the countries of the region refrain from adopting partisan positions. This applies particularly to those that are acting in the service of a super-Power  whether directly or indirectly. We condemn such action on the basis of the principle of non-intervention.The conflict in the Near East does not seem to be of concern to the world at the moment  possibly because the region has for so long suffered the absence of the peace that is essential for nations  peoples and States. The Republic of Paraguay has proclaimed in all forums  the need to ensure implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in the search for effective solutions to the problems in this high-risk area of conflict. We believe that the Palestinian people have the right to a homeland  just as the State of Israel has the right to live in peace within its boundaries.The Government of the Republic of Paraguay has condemned  in this forum  the intervention of a super-power in Afghanistan  in a clear-cut demonstration of that Power's lack of regard for international justice and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. We take this opportunity to reiterate  on a universal basis  that the application of this principle  which is central to our Charter and to human rights  is the sole guarantee of peace and harmony among nations at differing economic and social levels.We are also concerned by Viet Nam's intervention in Cambodia. That intervention  which is dangerous from all points of view  generates the intervention in that country by a super-Power on the one hand and by another country  also a permanent member of the Security Council  on the other.The Republic of Korea has always worked for the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas. Unfortunately  its efforts have not been crowned with success  for reasons that cannot be attributed to that country  a defender of freedom. The Republic of Korea  a law-abiding country that respects the international desire for coexistence  has a legitimate desire to become a Member State of our Organization. We support that legitimate desire of the Republic of Korea  which is in keeping with the principle of universality of the United Nations and with an effective international order  and believe that the possibility of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also being admitted should be kept open.The problem of the Malvinas Islands has had a number of consequences  which once again  demonstrate that disputes should be resolved by effective  pragmatic negotiations. The Republic of Paraguay calls upon the two countries involved - Argentina and the United Kingdom - with both of which we have ties of friendship  to adopt this procedure so as to find an amicable  felicitous solution to the dispute over sovereignty  In this spirit  we advocate negotiations between the parties.We cannot help but voice our concern when we turn to the subject of disarmament  a vital issue in the times in which we live. The arms race and the business of purchasing and selling conventional and nuclear arms themselves engender pressure and hostility and pave the way for armed conflict. Disarmament is a necessity for all States  and that necessity becomes even greater when we realize that many less developed countries that are in desperate straits because f the deterioration of the international economy are spending millions of dollars cm arms of various kinds. We live in peace and we believe in peace. In that spirit we call upon all States to end the arms race  which is a shameful affront considering the sad fact that thousands upon thousands of children are dying because of starvation and malnutrition.The Republic of Paraguay  which won independence on 14 May 1811  values the work on decolonisation being done by the United Nations. We applaud this work since we support the principle of the self-determination of peoples as long as application of that principle is not linked with interests alien to the legitimate interests of the peoples meant to win independence.On the basis of that position  we believe that the people of Namibia are entitled to independence. Further the Republic of Paraguay supports in all forums the principle of territorial integrity and the full sovereignty of peoples. We should like  on the basis of non-intervention in internal affairs  to see the withdrawal of foreign troops from the countries of Africa.There is one scourge that horrifies all people the world over but none the less continues to undermine the moral and legal order of our world. We refer to terrorism  which afflicts various individual countries as well as the international community. The time has come to ask ourselves what has been done to cope with this irrational  inhuman monstrosity to ensure that it ceases to take innocent lives. Terrorism cannot be legitimised in any circumstances. Countries that encourage terrorism based on the fact that there may exist underlying causes that trigger so irrational a reaction must  even if some of those causes exist  change their views in keeping with the dignity that must govern the system of relationships within the international community.We cannot tolerate terrorism because it is unjustifiable that certain territories should serve as training-camps for terrorists and still less that such territories should be used as sanctuaries for terrorists. The time has come to state categorically that the United Nations has two options: it can persuade all countries to condemn this irrational and inhuman conduct and to work together to eliminate the hotbeds of terrorism. Otherwise  our Organization will lack credibility in these matters and will be irrevocably forced to admit its inability to wipe out a practice that is a crime against mankind. But this is not to say that the United Nations should not continue to consider  with zeal and diligence  the elimination of the probable causes of this universal scourge. Those causes  however  can never explain the criminal violation of the right to life of its innocent victims.The Republic of Paraguay supports the policy of the United Nations to end all forms of discrimination against women. It has been many years since the law enshrining the civil and political rights of Paraguayan women was promulgated in recognition of an established fact and of the active part women had played in our national life. In a spirit of fairness we must also recognize that the North-South dialogue has so far produced no results whatsoever. The rich industrialized countries continue to set Incredibly low prices for the raw materials produced and exported by the developing world. This ignoble policy is the root cause of many of the problems of the developing world. The deterioration in the terms of trade leads b the regrettable fact that many countries are unable to pay their debts and are not in a position to reach the stage of full development they require in order for their people to attain a life of dignity.Although the Republic of Paraguay is not in the same position as other fraternal countries with regard to external debt  we express our solidarity with all those countries that are facing such a situation. This issue requires not only financial and economic solutions  which are of prime importance but also political solutions  because no country can resign itself to zero progress when there are collective needs to be met in order to forestall situations that may endanger not only the peace but the freedom of peoples in the developing countries.Our Organization must identify itself fully with the legitimate requests formulated by countries in the unfortunate position of being unable to repay their debts. The rich industrialized countries must take a stand  not out of selfish and restrictive motives but in a common desire to consolidate peace and democracy through justice in the international economic arena.All attempts and programmes formulated to resolve this disturbing problem of the burden of external debt in the world must inevitably be based on the recognition of the exporting countries' inalienable right to receive really fair prices for their raw materials exported to international markets.In the face of the painful developments in economic relations between the industrialized North and the developing South  the real needs of developing countries have given rise to certain aspirations. We refer to economic and technical co-operation between developing countries. The United Nations  in all its forums  including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  must use its prestige to back up this effort which is being promoted throughout the world  for the most part through specialized organizations on the regional level.We must  finally  come to the conclusion that raising the standard of living of the developing peoples is a moral duty on the part of our Organization and of those countries that already enjoy high standards of life and enjoy fully the many benefits that are unattainable in the developing countries. In this context what is required is a carefully implemented effort to achieve a better economic position for the raw-material-producing countries or for those countries that are just beginning industrial development.The Government of Paraguay is fully aware that there is an acute financial crisis at the United Nations. The developed countries  for reasons the developing countries cannot fully comprehend  have curtailed their contributions to our Organization  thus decreasing the total amount of moneys available. This financial crisis has an effective political dimension  since  in the short term  our Organization will have to make cuts throughout its system  cuts that will adversely affect programmes currently being implemented throughout the developing world.This will obviously have an adverse effect on the scope of the activities of our Organization and work to its detriment.We are fully aware  moreover  of economic stagnation and recession. We understand the scope of those problems  which are causing serious difficulties to the super-Powers in the commercial sphere and affecting the balance of payments. Nevertheless  the times in which we live compel the United Nations to depend on the contributions it needs for it to do its work throughout the world  contributions that must come from those industrialized countries fortunate enough to enjoy wealth and development.The problem of Lebanon merits a special place in my statement. It can be considered to be included in the aforementioned serious conflict in the Middle East  However  in view of the conditions now prevailing  conditions which  if they were to persist  could spawn new and tragic developments  we feel that we must give it special consideration.The principles of the self-determination of peoples and the territorial integrity of States have been set aside in Lebanon by the reign of irrational violence and have been replaced by political intransigence and the polarization of the conflicting parties. Paraguay holds unswervingly to the need for a peaceful settlement of disputes. It joins the concert of countries demanding this in order to ensure the existence and integrity of Lebanon on the basis of legal equality and peaceful coexistence among its citizens  to whatever ethnic group they belong.As for the question of Cyprus  the Republic of Paraguay is hopeful that that problem  which is long standing in the United Nations  can find a just and balanced solution through negotiations  avoiding violent confrontation and any violation of international law. We hope that United Nations intervention may lead to just solutions that take into consideration the rights of the countries concerned in the conflict.If all practical instruments to reach a happy conclusion in the current situation are not brought into play  the problem of Cyprus could well become yet another of the unending crises in today's world  which is truly and wholly interdependent. Armed conflict in one part of the world is not limited to that region but can have unpredictable repercussions and ramifications throughout the rest of the world.The developing world has immense prospects in the new Law of the Sea. The Republic of Paraguay  as a developing landlocked country  firmly believes that that instrument  which has been given the world to redress irritating and dangerous injustices  represents a new step forward by mankind in its painstaking quest for a better distribution of the world's wealth amongst nations. On the basis of that belief  Paraguay has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and will support that process  which redounds to the prestige of the Organization and which may  in the future  be a source of truly lasting satisfaction. The Republic of Paraguay has co-operated and will continue to co-operate with our Organization's Commission on Human Rights. In the course of that co-operation it welcomed the visit of an independent advisor in 1986  who travelled throughout our country and became fully aware of the actual situation in Paraguay. That same person  in pursuance of his work  which Paraguay continues to welcome  will visit our country again before the end of 1987.This is a demonstration of Paraguay's co-operation with the United Nations  which is dedicated to the promotion of human rights. Our Government responds immediately to all inquiries received from United Nations organs dealing with human rights  on the understanding that with the co-operation of Member countries these organs will intensify their work to the benefit of our Organization.We warmly support the loyal co-operation of the United Nations with the Organization of American States and the Latin American Economic System. We value such co-operation and we see it as having a positive and realistic significance in the interdependent world we live in - a world whose problems always requite global solutions. These assertions are valid in the political sphere  but their validity is even more apparent in the economic field.My Government enthusiastically supports the proposal put forward in this universal forum by the Republic of Brazil for the declaration and establishment of a zone of peace and co-operation in the South Atlantic. This valuable initiative for world peace and for free and progressive interplay in the South American continent deserves the attention of all international organizations which must work out specific programmes for this vital area of the world  in the arduous tasks of achieving peace with justice  equal opportunity and economic growth for everyone without exception.We can state with absolute certainty that men and women the world over look to the United Nations and its task with faith and confidence. They are at the very core of the efforts we make here on behalf of peace and progress for mankind; and they place their trust in our Organization and in the spirit of those who convene here to represent their Governments in order to foster the ideals and commitments of the founders and ensure for all the inhabitants of the globe the blessings of peace and the establishment of justice in international relations.We bear witness to our sharing this noble spirit and to our commitment that e shall work United in order to achieve these objectives and ideals  without which life would have no meaning  and to ensure a future free of storm clouds obscuring mankind's vision.We must freely shoulder our responsibility to bequeath to our children and our children's children the happy world future generations will expect - a world without discrimination without error  without injustice that engenders exasperation and dejection; and a creative atmosphere with joy  peace and moral fulfilment.

"117",5859,"QAT",42,1987,"﻿In addressing this international forum  I take pleasure in congratulating you. Sir  in the name of the State of Qatar  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session  which we are confident will be a successful one. Your election was a sign of appreciation of your vast experience and proved competence. We are sure that you will put all these qualities at the service of the Assembly's forty-second session.I should like also to express appreciation and thanks to your predecessor for the ability and competence with which he conducted the last session's work.Our highest commendation is also due to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his efforts and effective good offices in asserting the United Nations role in the preservation of international peace and security. In particular  we welcome his efforts in bringing conflicts to an end and eliminating the spectre of war. We commend his report to this session on the work of the Organization and affirm our support for its content.We  the Members of the United Nations  owe the Organization our allegiance and support in view of its services for the welfare and development of the international community and its consistent efforts to ensure the preservation of international peace  security and stability. Each of us should therefore uphold the Organization's role  strictly observe its Charter and respect and carry out its resolutions and recommendations. It is from this perspective that we should all proceed in our co-operative relationships with other States  regionally and at the global level. It is therefore with great regret that we note the non-compliance of some States Members of the Organization with the resolutions it adopts. We similarly regret the Organization's inability to require from these few States compliance with its resolutions. This state of affairs casts a pall of impotence over the Organization with regard to certain chronic international problems. It also adversely affects its credibility and the standing of its resolutions in the eyes of the world public.This critical view does not  however  detract from our appreciation of the efforts deployed so tirelessly by the Organization and the Secretary-General in the cause of international peace  security and stability.The Palestinian question remains the living example of disregard of United Nations resolutions in defiance of the political will of the world community. Ever since the displacement of the people of Palestine and the usurpation of their homeland  the Zionist racist entity has remained to this day unrivalled in its contemptuous disregard and arrogant defiance of United Nations resolutions. The actions of this racist entity are all contrary to international legality and to United Nations resolutions. Its behaviour is based on terrorism  hegemony and expansionism. In all this the hallmark of its actions has been utter disregard of international legality and deviation from humane and civilized conduct  relying on its military machine to inflict material and moral destruction.The Palestinian question remains the core of the Middle East problem. All other conflicts and problems in the region are by-products of that basic problem  which is  indeed  a problem for the whole world.We are quite certain that this sensitive region will not know stability and tranquillity until a just and comprehensive solution is found to the Palestinian problem  a solution which would return the Palestinian people to their homeland and enable them to set up an independent State on their national soil under the leadership of their sole  legitimate representative the Palestine Liberation Organization.We urge the world community to help put an end to Israel's arrogance and its defiance of the norms of international law so that such a just and comprehensive solution may be achieved. Israel's settlements policy  the aim of which is to deprive the Palestinian people of their historical right to a homeland and obliterate their identity and culture by destroying their educational  cultural and social institutions  must be brought to an end.The State of Qatar believes that the best means of reaching a just and permanent peace is to convene an international conference  to be attended by the permanent members of the Security Council and by the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Iran-Iraq war is a source of concern and anxiety to my country. It has now entered its eighth year and continues to result in an immense loss of life and resources in both countries. The persistence of that war has disrupted the peace and stability of the Gulf region and could disrupt world peace and stability as a result of threats to international shipping in the waters of the Gulf  the interruption of oil and gas supplies  the escalation of the so-called tanker war and the presence in the waters of the Gulf of increasing numbers of naval units of several States.The State of Qatar  together with the other member States of the Gulf Co-operation Council  is striving to find a way to put an end to the war through a negotiated settlement which would safeguard the legitimate rights of both parties  ensure that the Gulf region does not become the scene of international conflict and preclude the possibility of outside intervention  which has grave consequences for the peoples of the Gulf region.We hope that both parties will exercise the utmost self-restraint and not interfere further with freedom of navigation. We urge our two neighbours  Iran and Iraq  to co-operate in implementing Security Council resolution 598 (1907)  which expresses the common will of the international community in its endeavour to bring about a peaceful  just and comprehensive end to this war  conducive to tranquillity and peace in the region under the rule of international legality. Only such a solution can promote the best interests of the peoples of the region and of the world at large.We commend Iraq for its positive stand regarding resolution 598 (19tí7) and welcome its co-operation with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in that respect. We hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will act similarly.The recent incident at the holy sanctuary of Mecca  the attacks on the embassies of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in Tehran and the launching of a missile at Kuwaiti territory are ominous indicators of where the region may be heading. We express our regret and dismay at those incidents and demand that they not be repeated against any Arab State of the Gulf.Lebanon  that brother country  has been living a tragedy since its soil was occupied by Israel five years ago. Its people are experiencing atrocious suffering and part of its territory is still occupied. Imperative calls for withdrawal by the Security Council have  as usual/ been ignored by the Zionist entity. We therefore emphasize the need for the international community to fulfil its duty by seeking the complete withdrawal of Israel from all Lebanese territory. We declare our firm support for the independence of Lebanon and the preservation of its territorial sovereignty.My country expresses great satisfaction at the start of the work of a sub-item entitled ""Convening  under the auspices of the United Nations  of an international conference to define terrorism and to differentiate it with the struggle of peoples for national liberation"".Terrorism is indeed a dangerous phenomenon that threatens the world community. We condemn terrorism and look forward to concerted international action to combat it. Agreement on a precise definition of terrorism will be an important step towards that goal. By contrast  national liberation movements seeking self-determination ate legitimate under the United Nations Charter and should be supported by all.The State of Qatar views with increasing concern what is taking place in Afghanistan  which continues to be a focus of tension in the region and with which we share a common heritage of Islamic religion and history. The presence of foreign troops on Afghan territory threatens the peace and security of neighbouring nations  my country looks forward to the speedy withdrawal of foreign troops in order to enable the people of Afghanistan freely to choose their political system. Years of civil war have proved that there is no military solution to the problem. What is needed is dialogue and  ultimately  the opportunity for the people of Afghanistan to set up the kind of Government they prefer. The situation in southern Africa remains one of our concerns. We hope that suitable solutions will soon be found to bring to an end the suffering of the peoples of South Africa and Namibia. This should be possible when and if the racist regime in Pretoria complies with the resolutions of the United Nations and ends its evil policies towards the neighbouring peoples of southern Africa. My country supports the courageous struggle of the national majority in South Africa against the ruling white racist minority. It is the duty of all Member States to mobilize world public opinion in support of this just humanitarian cause. We reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  in their struggle against the continued occupation and colonization of their homeland in defiance of relevant United Nations resolutions.The world economic crisis still wreaks havoc in all States  especially the developing nations. The debt-servicing burden on many States of Africa  Asia and Latin America is increasing. The indebtedness of third-world nations has reached astronomical levels  estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. The terms of world trade have deteriorated and the negative effects of the protectionist measures imposed by industrial nations have become more apparent. Prices of raw materials produced by developing nations continue to fall  while prices of the products of industrial nations are on the rise. The resulting inflation and economic stagnation call for a renewed and intensified North-South dialogue  aiming at the establishment of a new economic order or  at the least  improvement and reform of the existing order.Economic growth is the only path likely to enable the developing nations to settle their foreign debts and avert financial ruin. In order to further the process of growth and development  developed nations should encourage the transfer of technology to developing nations  increase their imports from those nations and genuinely reduce the interest rates that burden the developing nations. They should even consider the total or partial cancellation of the debts of those developing nations. We consider it appropriate that loans by international financial institutions to developing nations be increased and the markets of developed nations be opened to the products of developing nations within the context of more stable and realistic trade arrangements.Industrialized countries should curb the arms race and allocate a considerable part of their present military expenditure to development assistance to developing countries.Further  the developing nations in turn should adopt economic policies aimed at restricting consumption and increasing investment and job opportunities for their work forces.

"118",5905,"ROU",42,1987,"﻿Your election  Sir  to the high post of President: the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly gives me the pleasant occasion to extend to you my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes of full success in the accomplishment of the mission entrusted to you.I feel especially honoured to present from the rostrum of this high forum the considerations and proposals of the President of Romania  Nicolae Ceauçescu  on the main issues of international life and on the ways to solve them  in accordance with the interests and aspirations for peace  independence and progress of the Romanian people  and indeed of all peoples of the world.Analysis of the evolution of international life reveals a picture which is utterly disquieting. The world situation continues to be particularly serious and complex. The arms race has assumed disturbing proportions. Nuclear tests aimed at the steady development of weapons of mass destruction are still going on. This has harmful effects on the natural environment and  in fact  on life on earth. At the same time  far from diminishing  the conflicts  crises and hotbeds of tension in various regions of our planet have even worsened  thus generating new threats to the peace and security of mankind.The policy of force  of threat of force and gross interference in the Internal of other States continues unabated. These manifestations are incompatible with the principles and norms of international law  morality and ethics. Furthermore  the world economic crisis has become more serious and more profound  affecting all States. Its adverse effects are being felt primarily by developing countries  whose situation is already tragic.In the view of Romania  and President Nicolae Ceausescu  the sole  compelling alternative at present is to reverse the dangerous course of events and bar the road which leads to a nuclear catastrophe. A new world war is inconceivable  for it would mean the practical annihilation of life on our planet. Hence the need to renounce  once and for all  the wrong and outdated conception upheld by some nuclear-weapon States that nuclear weapons strengthen security and contribute to the maintenance of peace.Romania considers that the fundamental problem of our era is to halt the arms race and pass on resolutely to disarmament  in particular nuclear disarmament  to defend the supreme right of peoples and individuals alike to peace  life  and a free and dignified existence.In its overall international activities Romania devotes all its efforts to a permanent dialogue and wider and more diversified contacts with all States  irrespective of their social system. Firmly underlying all its relations are the principles of full equality of rights  respect for national independence and sovereignty  the non-use of force or the threat of force  non-interference in the internal affairs and mutual benefit.In view of the unprecedented scope attained by the arms race  in particular the nuclear-arms race  and the need for determined measures in the field of disarmament  we deem it necessary for the Assembly to give these issues top priority at the present session. We believe that all States must intensify their endeavours and actions in order to achieve this objective.Romania and President Nicolae Ceausescu propose that the General Assembly launch an appeal to the Soviet Union and the United States  since their positions are very close  to conclude without delay  as of this year  an agreement on the elimination of all medium- and shorter-range missiles from Europe and the whole world.At the same time  the General Assembly should call upon the countries that have nuclear weapons on their territory to renounce them and refrain from raising obstacles of any kind to the achievement of an agreement. Furthermore  all countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world should be called upon to act resolutely in order to achieve such an agreement this year. We welcome the recent Soviet-American understanding in principle in this respect and express our hope that the accord will be signed at the summit meeting to take place in the autumn of this year.Taking into account that nuclear tests are stepping up the arms race while having damaging effects on the environment  the General Assembly should address an appeal  primarily to the United States and the Soviet Union  but also to the other nuclear-weapon States  to halt nuclear testing and any other activities designed to develop and improve nuclear weaponry. Similarly  all the States of the world should be called upon to undertake to use nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes  for the benefit of humanity at large.While according priority attention to matters relating to nuclear disarmament  Romania holds the view that resolute and tangible measures are also needed to reduce conventional armaments  troops and military expenditures  which this year topped $1 000 billion for the world as a whole.Consistent with its proposals in recent years in this field  Romania proceeded to a unilateral reduction of its weapons  troops and military expenditures by 5 per cent  following a national referendum in which practically all the people took part. In this way  the Romanian people asserted its will and determination to act unflinchingly in favour of disarmament and peace. In our view  the adoption of unilateral disarmament measures by States would constitute a practical way of passing from words to deeds and making real progress towards general disarmament. In the same spirit of a new approach to disarmament problems which requires that all possible avenues be explored  Romania considers it necessary for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Warsaw Treaty countries to start as soon as possible negotiations on conventional disarmament  with the participation of other countries of the European continent.Bearing in mind the increased role that the United Nations should assume  Romania proposes that the General Assembly take action to prepare and finalize a complex programme of nuclear and general disarmament  to be submitted for adoption at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  scheduled to be held in 1988. The programme should lay down measures for the phased elimination of all nuclear weapons and the substantial reduction of conventional weapons  troops and military expenditures  as well as for the prohibition of the production of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. We believe that this programme should specify the need for the various problems and issues relating to nuclear and conventional disarmament to be resolved independently  without some being conditional upon others.Following the same line of thought  Romania believes that the preparation and adoption by the United Nations of an international document setting forth the principles that should govern negotiations among States on freezing and reducing military expenditures would have a stimulating effect on the efforts of the world community in the field of disarmament. It is of special importance to halt any measures designed to militarise outer space  which should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes in the interest of all mankind. As the great number of satellite launchings have harmful effects on the natural environment of life on Earth  we propose that the General Assembly address an appeal to all countries launching satellites to limit such launchings.Likewise  we propose that the General Assembly call upon all States of the world to start early negotiations to regulate the use of outer space for peaceful purposes only  and to establish a rational system for its use as an asset of all mankind.The interests of international peace and security make it increasingly necessary to set up nuclear- and chemical-weapon-free zones  for developing good neighbourliness  mutual understanding and co-operation. It is in this spirit that Romania takes consistent action towards turning the Balkans into a zone of good neighbourliness  peace and co-operation  free of nuclear and chemical weapons  foreign troops and military bases. In this respect  it is of special significance to recall the recent proposals advanced jointly by Romania and Greece to convene in Bucharest a high-level meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Balkan countries.Equally  Romania upholds the setting up of nuclear- and chemical-weapon-free zones in northern and central Europe  as well as on other continents. We consider it necessary for the United Nations to encourage initiatives designed to establish such zones  including nuclear-weapon-free cities and towns on various continents. Such moves are likely to strengthen confidence and security at the regional and world levels.Against the background of the ever-closer interdependence that characterizes today's world  and bearing in mind the evolution of international events  Romania proposes that the United Nations address a general appeal to all States in conflict to bring their military operations to an end. It should also call upon all States to proceed to the settlement of all pending issues and disputes between them by peaceful means  through negotiations. The General Assembly should call for the cessation of any form of military operations during negotiations  from their beginning.The Security Council  or a United Nations special body  should be empowered Ь monitor the implementation of obligations assumed as to the cessation of military activities throughout the negotiations and to ensure the solution of the issues through negotiations.As regards the situation in the Middle East  the stand and the actions taken by Romania and its President are consistently aimed at ensuring a global  just and durable peace  based on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories  on recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to set up a Palestinian State  and on a guarantee of the independence and sovereignty of all States in the region. We consider that a realistic way of bringing peace to the Middle East is to convene an international conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations  to be attended by all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  Israel and the permanent members of the Security Council. We believe that such a historic chance for the much tried region of the Middle East finally to find its tranquillity and peace should not be missed.With regard to the Iran-Iraq conflict  Romania welcomed the Security Council resolution which favours the cessation of the war without delay and a political settlement  by means of negotiations  of all the issues between the two countries. We also support the action of the Secretary-General in this matter. We stand firmly for the renunciation of all acts conducive to an extension of the conflict. It is imperative to withdraw all foreign military ships from the Gulf  to step up efforts towards the cessation of the Iran-Iraq war and to ensure free navigation in that region  as well as in all other oceans and seas of the world.Similarly  Romania supports any actions and initiatives favouring peaceful solutions to the conflict situations in Central America as  indeed  in other regions of the world. In this context  we believe it necessary for the General Assembly to work out the mandate for finalizing the initiative which Romania took at preceding sessions on resort to a United Nations commission of good offices  mediation or conciliation for the peaceful settlement of disputes. We also think it necessary to start the elaboration of an international document on the development and strengthening of good-neighbourly relations between States and to devise methods conducive to the strengthening of the United Nations role and capacity to work for the maintenance of international peace and security.Consistent with its policy  Romania firmly upholds the peoples' national liberation struggle  and lends its active support to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in its fight for Namibia's independence. We strongly condemn the racist  apartheid policy of South Africa and that country's hostile acts against neighbouring independent and sovereign States. We favour the taking of tangible and effective actions against the Pretoria racist minority regime.We reaffirm our solidarity with  and active support for  the position and initiatives taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  and its political and diplomatic efforts and actions aimed at bringing about the peaceful  democratic and independent unification of Korea.In the present conditions of the world economy  which is beset by continued crisis phenomena both in the economic and the monetary-financial fields  the economic situation of developing countries has worsened considerably  while the economic  technical and scientific gaps separating them from developed countries have continued to widen. We have recently witnessed a proliferation of protectionist and discriminator barriers to international trade  in particular to the exports of manufactured products from developing countries  coupled with a decline in the prices of their export commodities. However  the most serious problem faced by developing countries is the burden incurred by their foreign debts  the value of which has now reached the colossal figure of 1 000 billion dollars.Therefore  President Nicolae Ceausescu considers that the General Assembly should adopt an appeal to be addressed to all creditor developed countries and to all banks and international financial institutions to the effect that they should establish a moratorium of at least five years on all credits given to developing countries by the economically developed countries and by banking institutions  including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The appeal should include a demand that a ceiling of not more than 5 per cent be fixed for rates of interest on existing credits. It should also ask that the principle be established that rates of interest on future credits should not exceed 4 to 5 per cent; that banks  in their turn  should pay interest of up to 5 per cent on their respective deposits; and that commercial credits should be repaid in compliance with such norms and understandings as are agreed between the parties. At the same time  the General Assembly should make an appeal to all States to renounce any protectionist and discriminatory measures  any artificial barriers and any restrictions and quotas in the field of international trade  and to apply firmly the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on the granting of most-favoured-nation treatment.The situation of the world economy calls for a resumption of the dialogue between developing countries and industrialized countries. In this respect Romania has proposed that an international conference be convened within the United Nations  to be attended  with equal rights  by both developed and developing countries. Such a conference should have the purpose of seeking mutually acceptable solutions to the economic problems  including that of foreign debts  in order to eliminate underdevelopment and establish the new international economic order.To increase the United Nations role and contribution to the political and economic settlement of the foreign-debt problem  on a global basis  it appears necessary to set up  within the framework of the United Nations  a special body on the foreign-debt problem which should discuss and make proposals on concrete and effective steps to be taken in this field. The proceedings of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development made it strikingly clear that  while at the world level there exist numerous unsolved economic and social problems of a most serious nature  the arms race absorbs huge resources every year  thus becoming an increasingly heavy burden on all peoples.The message which the President of Romania sent to the Conference contains a set of proposals designed to freeze military budgets at the 1987 level and to reduce them in the initial phase by 5 per cent. The resources thus saved would be used both to meet internal socio-economic needs and to increase the contributions to the United Nations technical assistance programmes.Now  at the confluence of our century and the third millennium  science and technology have become a decisive factor of progress. But in this area of human endeavour also  yawning gaps have been created between economically developed countries and developing countries. Here too it appears both necessary and urgent to agree  within the United Nations framework  on the proper methods to be used so that all countries  primarily developing countries  may benefit from the major gains of human genius - hence the need to convene a second United Nations conference on science and technology for development.The complex and particularly serious situation of international life in the political  military  economic and social spheres requires the democratisation of International relations and respect for the sovereign right of all States  irrespective of their size  their economic or military strength and their socio-political system  to participate  on the basis of full equality and mutual respect  in the solution of all problems of concern to mankind. In that light  we stand for the strengthening of the role of the United Nations and the other international organizations  so that their activities may be focused on the settlement of the cardinal issues of today's world.Life and its realities call for strict observance of the principles and norms of international law in relations between States and for the establishment of a comprehensive system of peace and security in the interest of all peoples.We hold the view that there is a need to improve and simplify the machinery of the United Nations Secretariat. We are also convinced that the Organization's temporary financial difficulties should not result in a decline in its essential political and economic activities or in alterations of the democratic structures of the United Nations. The point of view of Romania  of President Nicolae Ceausescu  on the main issues of present international life gives expression to the constructive vocation of the Romanian people for peace and large-scale international co-operation. At the same time  it constitutes an ardent call on all States  peoples and realistic forces to join efforts in order to remove the danger of war  once and for all  to exclude force from international life and to establish a new world  a world of peace  understanding and co-operation."
"119",5951,"RUS",42,1987,"﻿The Soviet delegation has instructed me Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the honourable post of President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.One of the rules of procedure of this Organization reserves a minute for prayer or meditation. Each session of the United Nations General Assembly is an occasion for reflection on the future of the world. Today the world is on the threshold of great changes and our thoughts are about that. For the first time in history  the idea of nuclear disarmament is close to the beginning of fulfilment. It is not a new idea. What is new is that this is proving to be possible. Only yesterday  all we could see ahead of us was a blank wall: today we can see far ahead.Two thousand warheads are but a small part of nuclear arsenals  but that is a big enough part forbids disappearance to give to the world a new vision. The agreement on these weapons is only a small part of what has happened. Something much more important has taken place; the Soviet Union and the United states have finally spoken together the first word in a nuclear-free vocabulary. When that word becomes deed  the world will also gain new knowledge. It will become convinced that nuclear weapons and security are not synonymous and that security becomes stronger when those weapons disappear.For the present  that principle is being established in a specific case  but it is already being established in practice. The whole question now is whether we shall be able  proceeding from the same logical premise  to abandon the entire nuclear arsenal rather than just a part of it  to scrap all weapons of mass destruction.The Soviet Union is convinced that we shall be able to do so. The launching pad is small but it provides a boost to a great undertaking. The recent agreement may be followed by an accord on the reduction by as much as one half of strategic weapons - provided  of course  that the Treaty limiting anti-ballistic missile system is preserved.Today there is an increasingly realistic prospect of a convention on the prohibition and complete destruction of chemical weapons. We can expect a productive development of the parallel process of reduction of conventional weapons based on the concept of sufficiency. There is a possibility of making headway because we have bold ideas and willingness to remove the remaining obstacles.An affirmative answer to the question of whether it is possible to scrap nuclear arsenals will become a reality if the international community once again helps us.There is no need to compete here for the palm of victory  which does not go well with the olive branch of peace. I could describe how the Soviet Union has worked towards the global double zero  but let others claim the credit if they wish. For that matter  if we have to compete in something it should be only in nuclear disarmament. What is important for us is that what was sought has now been achieved and the outcome is not at variance with the will of the majority.We are moved by the enthusiasm with which the world has welcomed the agreement. It convinces us once again that we are on the right track. Listening to the voices of approval and solidarity  which drown the morose and solitary voice of the nuclear profiteers  your Soviet colleague  without sharing the euphoria and yet without curbing the optimism  keenly feel that today all of us here are truly United nations - United not merely by formal membership in this Organization but by a common destiny and a shared objective. We thank you for this wonderful feeling. It should be treasured and carried further. Thank you for the atmosphere of unity of thought  co-operation and support which alone could have produced an agreement.In this sense the agreement is yours. And the fact that it belongs to everyone is  as we see it  the best guarantee of its implementation.""We were born to live together. And our community is like an arch which holds up precisely because Its stones prevent each other from falling ..."" One is amazed by the ability of human thought to establish the supreme ethical law for all times. ""We were born to live together""  so wrote Seneca to Lucillius many years ago in his Epistles  but it is only today that this idea is being understood as the imperative of our time.Today  Lenin's Decree of Peace is perceived as a message of supreme morality addressed to our time. The repudiation of secret treaties  open and public conduct of International affairs  the immediate withdrawal from the war and the rejection of War as a method of resolving conflicts reflected  even as far back as 1917  a common need  which has now become the will of the entire International community.A long and difficult road must be traversed for human thought to become action  but it does happen sooner or later. When  in Washington  we were discussing the techniques of the destruction of nuclear warheads we were suddenly struck by the fact that only a year ago this had seemed something well beyond our grasp. Our American partners can confirm this. It is hard to find words to express this. Let us just say that the past gives a powerful impetus to the present  and the present gives guarantees to the future.""The reality and the guarantees of a secure world"" is the title of Mikhail Gorbachev's article published before this session began  and it conveys the gist of our thinking today.A secure world is possible. It Is possible because anything else is too dangerous. The possibility of a secure world is commensurate with the need for it This is the reality. As for guarantees  we see them in a comprehensive system of security. It is the natural task of the United Nations to give inspiration to and take the lead in building such a system.This  reduced to a concise formula  is the logic of that article  which develops the doctrine of a secure world. It stems from the history of our country and is the fruit of political thinking that honestly analyses the entire preceding period.In this context I would venture to remind the Assembly that its forty-second session coincides with the eve of the seventieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This is our celebration and we are not imposing it on anyone. The feelings aroused by the birthday of our State are ours. Nevertheless  I would venture to share with representatives my thoughts on some of the international implications of that date.I do not think that it can be disputed that the October Revolution was one of the major events of this century and has had a tremendous impact on the destinies of peoples  not only those of the former Russian Empire. We think that the process of renovation which is under way in our country is more than just a strictly domestic affair of the Soviet Union  It is impossible to describe as purely the concern of the Soviet Union its desire to do away with one of the products of the cold war  which is the splitting of the world into hostile alliances.All this  naturally  is also part of the objectives of perestroika - our process of change - while glasnost - openness - and dialogue are  as logically  its instruments  in both domestic and foreign policies. Between these two there exists a direct and open relationship and one cannot be implemented without the other. This  and this alone  allows me  when speaking about the seventieth anniversary of our revolution  to invite you all to take thought together.If we have a concept of a world revolution  which is most closely linked with the process of revolutionary change in our country  we make no secret of it. It is this: organizing the entire human community on the basis of recognizing peace as the supreme value of existence  human life  freedom and dignity as a general yardstick  and peaceful coexistence as a universal principle of relations among States. This concept  proclaimed in the Political Report to the 27th Congress of our Communist Party  has been substantiated by a series of practical steps taken by the Soviet Union Perestroika has also heralded major changes in international affairs. It should not be obstructed. But  of course  unlike the position in 1917 or 1918  in 1987 no external action could halt our revolution. Today we live in different times  and it is a different country. And that could be one of the greatest achievements of the October Revolution. The price of this was enormous. It was set by the foreign intervention and the civil war; the ruined economy and the economic blockade; terror and the attempts to subvert the foundations of our multinational State; Nazi aggression and the cold war  which was imposed on us; nuclear blackmail and constant attempts at political diktat. Not a single day passed without our having to pay the highest price.Unlike many other revolutions  the October Revolution was almost bloodless. Unlike many others  its architects never Intended to build their temple on blood; they never thought  as had many before them  that cruelty  violence and fear were the best glue for cementing their ideal.It was the policies of conspiracy  terror and intervention against Soviet Russia that made it shut and lock its doors and cut itself off from a hostile world. In order to survive it was necessary to do the maximum within the historically minimum space of time. A chronic lack of time and unending pressure on all fronts also helped create the conditions which resulted in innocent victims and irreparable losses. We are saying this for all to hear: there is not and there cannot be any justification for that. We do more than just say it. As heirs to both victories and defeats  achievements and mistakes  we are doing our utmost to consolidate the victories and to prevent even the slightest possibility of the errors being repeated In either domestic or in foreign policies. This is a distinctive feature of our perestroika  its dominant trend  any indicator of the vigour and health of our society  a guarantee of Its future  of its profound internal democratism  openness and integrity. And there is no need to engage in linguistic research to try to provide listeners with an English equivalent of the word glasnost. One might go astray in a foreign language  as has indeed already happened with the same speaker  who claimed that there is no word meaning ""freedom"" in the Russian language. It is generally dangerous to play with words in this forum in which by no means everyone is ready to applaud insults summarily flung at entire countries and peoples. Freedom does indeed serve peace - but it is not the freedom that is interpreted as licence to interfere in the affairs of others and to finance counter-revolution as a most profitable business.As for our perestroika  no one should be a prey to illusions. We shall not turn aside from the main road or borrow from others their norms and rules of democracy. We thank them for their advice  but we shall conduct perestroika according to our own design  on our own socialist basis. Allow us to determine for ourselves what the Soviet Union is going to be and that will be what the Soviet people want it to be.Those who want to support us will also support the project of rebuilding international relations on a broad democratic basis. They will support the concept of a nuclear-free world and all actions to resolve the knottiest issues of world politics. For here the interests of most members of the community fully coincide.This rostrum is not a pulpit for preaching ""free enterprise"". This Hall is not a schoolroom or a university auditorium in which one can teach lessons in rhetoric or lecture the international community on the manners of ""good political behaviour"". it is even less worthy to adopt the tone of pastoral admonition and tell the Organization that ""sometimes it has strayed"" and ""it is time for it to come home"". One can say  however  that this rostrum and this Hall are the very place where new political thinking should be expressed.However much the world is split by confrontation and hatred  it is United in facing the need to preserve itself and to perpetuate mankind.Prom this objective reality there emerges another guiding light for new political thinking; in our time  the correlation between the national interest and the interest of all mankind has changed. It has changed in the sense that truly national interests cannot be opposed to common interests.If  on the pretext that something is contrary to the interests of national security or to considerations of national prestige  one rejects everything that is born of the political thinking of the systems or governments that one does not like  then  sooner or later  this will boomerang on the genuine national interests of one's own people and State.New political thinking must put an end to that. New political thinking will put an end to it if it is put into action. And there is no doubt that it will be  for action  unity of concept and implementation  of thought and its realization  of word and deed  are crucial conditions for the existence of mankind.New political thinking will inevitably make its way  for it is nourished by some remarkable elements: by the accumulation of progressive political experience  by strictly scientific analysis  evaluation and forecasting of contemporary realities} and  ultimately  by the freedom of new political thinking from national narrow-mindedness that provokes animosity towards countries  groups of countries or social political systems.In this regard  let me say that the policy of hostility towards socialism is now bankrupt  both in theory and in practice. The very fact of the establishment of the United Nations contained the embryo of the new political thinking. Even at that time its principles were embodied in the articles of the United Nations Charter  which is undoubtedly one of the greatest statutory instruments of all time and of all nations.The fact that our Organization has been functioning for over 40 years now is testimony to the triumph of mankind's common interests over narrow-minded nationalism and great-Power attitudes. In fact  all the post-war decades have been nothing but the history of the struggle between outdated political concepts and the new political thinking that was born in the agony of war.When life on earth depends on one's ability to destroy it 20 times over  there is something wrong either with oneself and one's trust in such a guarantee of life  or with the very idea of deterrence. Most likely  it is both. New political thinking exposes the absurdity of the idea of safeguarding anyone's security with nuclear weapons.However  a question immediately arises: Is it possible to ensure peace by other methods and  indeed  do such methods exist at all? New political thinking answers: Yes. And here again I should like to focus on a comprehensive system of international security.As emerges clearly from Mikhail Gorbachev's statements  we envision its formation as a multilinear process extending over time and implemented through collective efforts. In essence  its objective is that peace should be ensured exclusively by the United Nations and its Security Council on the basis of strict observance of the principles and provisions of its Charter. I anticipate a question here: If that is your objective  then what is the meaning of your proposal? After all  the Charter of the United Nations already exists and the universal organization for peace is functioning.Let me remind the Assembly that the United Nations was established for a world free of nuclear weapons and that its Charter was  naturally  designed to solve the problems of such a world.Nuclear weapons gave rise to a different reality which  in the final analysis  made it impossible to use the United Nations fully as the principal mechanism for the maintenance of peace and security. It so happened that the nuclear tumour limited the scope of  and the possibilities for applying the Charter. Now the prospect of militarization of outer space threatens to erode its principles even further. There should however be no question of adapting the Charter to the realities of the nuclear and space age or  still less  of wrecking it. The Charter is a great document  which even today contains all the necessary provisions to enable mankind to live and solve its problems without war.However  even the Charter cannot do the impossible. No organization  no set of rules  no code of behaviour can save the world in the few minutes between the launching of a missile and a nuclear holocaust. If and when the implementation of the ""Star Wars"" programme begins  the ""shagreen leather"" of that time interval will shrink even further. And yet that programme has been touted here once again as a way ""to ensure a safer world"".This is not so. And here I will refer to a person whose statements have been quoted so readily by the President of the United States - even the day before yesterday. That person is academician Andrei Sakharov  who said:""My opinion as regards this programme is different from that of the Reagan Administration... it is also wrong to assert that the existence of the SDI programme has made the Soviet Union negotiate on disarmament. To the contrary  the SDI programme impedes the negotiations.""If we are to believe an academician in one area  why should we not believe him in another  in which he is really a qualified expert and a professional?Leave the ocean of space to peaceful vessels  so that future generations - our children  grandchildren and great-grandchildren - will not have to build space minesweeper s.Excluding the nuclear and space component from the security equation is the only path towards real security. We regard a comprehensive system of security as a kind of interim programme for reasserting the role of the United Nations and its Charter as the primary instruments for peace.What  then  are the practical aspects of a comprehensive system? Throughout the past year the sponsors of the resolution on this question have held consultations with Members of the United Nations and discussed their proposal in international forums. As a result many things have now become clearer  our ideas have become more concrete  and an atmosphere of teamwork has arisen. The system is taking precise shape in all its four aspects: politico-military  economic  environmental and humanitarian.In the politico-military area  it comprises the obligation of Governments not to be the first to use nuclear weapons or any force or threat of force making military doctrines exclusively defensive in nature) making public data regarding defence expenditures and calendars of exercises and manoeuvres) the adoption by all of the principle of non-offensive defence} and instituting a reliable system of verification.We are convinced that a comprehensive system of security will also provide the key to the settlement of situations of regional conflict. That may be one of the roost difficult tasks of today.In this connection I shall venture to make a brief digression to address some ideas presented here the other day. I am referring to the statement made here by the President of the United States the day before yesterday. I am not going to relish engaging in polemics with him. The emotions aroused by the agreement we have reached  ray status as a guest and respect for seniority restrain  e from taking up  point by point  allegations and arguments that are groundless in the extreme. But since the President mentioned the human heart - claiming  as it were  a monopoly on having a heart while denying it to others - I should like to say the following.It is heartless to declare regions and continents zones of special interest for the so-called free world out of which it pumps into its own economy resources belonging to other peoples. It is heartless to recruit and arm mercenaries  to proclaim them freedom fighters  and to pay millions of dollars for the murders committed by them. It is heartless to put into the hands of bandits weapons they use to shoot down civilian aircraft. The human heart is an extremely sensitive organ  and it shudders at such treatment.Those who have not suffered have no compassion for anyone  we know what war on our own territory means. Therefore it is not for the sake of rhetorical effect that we declare our support for the efforts of the United Nations.It plays an extremely important peace-making role in Afghanistan  where the mission of the Personal Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General organically combines with the policy of national reconciliation. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Afghans themselves are able to decide the future of their own country and indeed are doing so. This new encouraging trend is in keeping with our sincere desire to withdraw Soviet forces from Afghanistan as soon as possible  and in this we are meeting with the full understanding of the Afghan leadership.In Central America  the States of the region themselves have made impressive headway towards a long-awaited peace. Their success is shared by members of the Contadora Group and the Support Group and by all Latin American countries.Dialogue between the countries of Indo-China and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has revealed promising elements. The policy of national reconciliation is also beginning to work in Kampuchea.Real possibilities exist for the settlement of the Korean problem. The yearning of the Korean people for an easing of tension in the peninsula and the withdrawal of foreign troops and nuclear weapons cannot but evoke sympathy.The United Nations has a detailed plan for giving effect to the resolution on the granting of independence to the Namibian people. Its implementation would also constitute a major step towards a settlement of the situation in southern Africa. A consensus is emerging in favour of convening a conference on the Middle East problem. In Cyprus  our Organization and its Secretary-General have also been taking vigorous action and refusing to retreat in the face of obstacles.Here is our view of the situation in the Persian Gulf. It has become critically dangerous and might get out of control. We are not at all pleased that the development of events - which we warned was quite possible from the very outset - shows that we were right. The greater the military presence  the higher the probability of yet another conflict and the involvement in it of a State not belonging to the region. This is a source of great anxiety to us; it also strengthens our resolve to act in a sober and carefully considered manner and leads us once again to emphasize the question of removing the danger of a massive military presence.In the circumstances  it is extremely important to preserve the unity in the Security Council. That is not an end in itself  but a prerequisite for implementing resolution 598 (1987) . In their individual actions  each member of the Council must abide by the resolution's requirements and not violate them.The safety of navigation in the Gulf can and must be ensured by the entire world community  on whose behalf the United Nations will be acting. If necessary  appropriate and sufficient forces should be made effectively available to it  and the Soviet Union would agree to such a decision.It is necessary to secure  concurrently and immediately  a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and to work for the fulfilment of the Secretary-General's mission with respect to an impartial body to investigate the question of responsibility for the conflict. The Security Council should receive a report within a clearly established time-frame. This would also make it possible painlessly to withdraw foreign naval and other armed forces from the Persian Gulf.It is very important now  in our view  to keep our composure and render every assistance to the Secretary-General and the Security Council.In the economic field  a comprehensive system of security seeks to promote co-operation that would be free of confrontation and would cover the entire system of co-ordinates of international economic relations. A failure to resolve issues in this area is fraught with an explosive potential which  if detonated  would spell catastrophe for mankind. The picture of prosperity painted here the day before yesterday fades in the harsh light of reality  it is hard to imagine a ""march of democracy"" in the developing countries saddled as they are with a trillion-dollar debt. It is Impossible to talk seriously of equal opportunities when a new  technological  variety of colonialism is at work.It is imperative to act.We believe that the international community could reach agreement to reduce interest payments on bank credits  institute further benefits for the least developed countries  limit the annual debt-service payments of each developing country to a fixed portion of its annual export earnings  accept export products of debtor nations as payment for their debts and remove protectionist barriers to their imports  and refrain from charging additional interest for loan-payment rescheduling and debt refinancing.These  of course  are only suggestions for discussion  but even now consideration could be given to devising a programme of Immediate action to ease the debt burden of the developing world.Over the long term it is also necessary to restructure the entire international monetary system. And  of course  nothing would be more conducive to the economic development of nations than the most far-reaching programme of disarmament.We are familiar also with a different viewpoint which does not acknowledge the relationship between disarmament and development. There are some who explain poverty by the inability of people to work and build their own lives. This is but another form of outright racism. No people is without talent or incapable of creating material and spiritual wealth. It is just a matter of different conditions that either help a people to realize its potential or thwart its efforts to do so. The elimination of economic discrimination creates favourable conditions for people to prosper economically and spiritually.The environmental aspect of the proposed concept reflects the evolution of thinking about the relationship between man and nature. The achievement of mankind's environmental security is as imperative as the threat of an ecological disaster facing it is real. Today we must realize that the protection of the environment must be ensured on a world-wide basis. Confrontation narrows the scope for concerted action  while co-operation can expand it. Our concept provides for a set of measures in this area.The human dimension is the primary yardstick for a comprehensive system of security. Nations can and must co-operate in establishing the best international conditions for safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual everywhere  democratising internal conditions and building trust and harmony on that basis.We should together begin to devise a broad range of practical steps in the humanitarian area  promote co-operation in eradicating apartheid  racism  chauvinism  nationalism and discrimination on those bases  deal jointly with the problems of national minorities and refugees  and safeguard the rights of emigrants.We submit that for States and nations trust begins at home and that to a large extent it is based on the unity of words and deeds and in complete accord between political declarations and actual positions. Our domestic and foreign policy is and will continue to be guided by that principle  and we reserve our right to demand the same of all other Governments/ our partners. The political  social  economic and cultural rights of the individual should be safeguarded on the basis of generally accepted international instruments. That is the way it should be everywhere.The countries that have put forward this proposal do not claim a certificate of copyright. The system of security grows out of what has already been accomplished in the process of the peaceful coexistence of nations in the post-War years. It grows out of the activities of the United Nations  It is rooted in a broad legal foundation and the treaties which restrain the arms race. It is rooted in the negotiations on the central problems of our time and the codification of human rights standards/ in regional security-building processes and in the Non-Aligned Movement.As a logical result of the development of mankind's common culture in this century  that system promises to become in the future a framework for the collective application of the creative efforts of all countries and peoples. Today  when 2/000 weapons can be removed from the face of the earth/ when a historic breakthrough has been achieved in a 42-year-long trend/ such a system reflects what we believe to be a genuine  irreversible process; a product of will and perseverance. For we are indeed born to live together and we shall stand together if we become an arch in which we support each other.Our Assembly session provides the best occasion for reflecting on this. Its time should not be taken up with confrontation and hostility  I tell you frankly that the world is tired of that. There have been too many quotations intended to prove that you are dealing with the spawn of Hell. That is simply not serious or well founded. There have been too many accusations that detract front the dignity of nations. It is time for us to proceed to earnest dialogue; time to get down to business.In these moments  as we stand face to face with the past and the present  we are keenly aware that when this pause for reflection is over we shall once again have to act  and again act."
"120",5998,"RWA",42,1987,"﻿States Members of the United Nations have faithfully adhered to a well-established tradition and come to their annual meeting arranged so that they can together consider in a constructive dialogue the problems facing the international community. Every session of the General Assembly constitutes an ideal opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the fundamental purposes and principles of our Organization as set forth in the Charter. The Charter charges Member States with the mission of working for peace and contributing to the development of international relations for the purpose of promoting the prosperity and economic and social progress which all peoples desire. This Assembly provides the framework within which efforts to improve the lot of mankind on the basis of the ethical standards shared by all countries that cherish peace  freedom  equality  justice and progress are harmonized.   On joining the United Nations as its 97th Member  on 18 September 1962  the Republic of Rwanda solemnly expressed its determination to abide by those ethical standards  which are based on equal rights for all peoples and the ideal of peace and co-operation expressed in San Francisco in 1945. The Republic of Rwanda hopes that this ideal will take ever more concrete form and that the efforts of all Member States will ensure that our Organization can carry out the mission assigned to it  Rwanda will always be among the countries eager to work in this sense. At this session the commitment we entered into in this respect  in 1962 takes on a particular significance  for this is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Rwanda and its admission to the United Nations family. In recalling this dual anniversary I wish to reaffirm on behalf of the Government of Rwanda the Republic of Rwanda's support for the objectives laid down in the Charter. This support is accompanied by the hope that the negative factors that imperil the attainment of these objectives will gradually disappear. One of those negative factors is the policy of certain countries which are reluctant to accept the principles based on universal legality} other such factors are the oppression of peoples who legitimately desire respect for their inalienable rights and the persistence of sources of tension and conflicts in the world. These factors cause acute concern at the present time when the world community should be devoting its main efforts to meeting the challenges brought about by the economic imbalances that afflict the developing countries.Far from decreasing  the economic difficulties  on which the General Assembly puts growing emphasis  are increasing and taking on new dimensions that bode ill for the progress that all peoples desire. The world economy is still experiencing a crisis which threatens the very survival of the countries of the third world and could thwart their arduous development efforts. The crisis is essentially structural in nature for it affects the mechanisms which govern international economic relations at the present time and has an increasingly negative effect owing mainly to the instability of financial markets  the continuing deterioration of terms of trade  the stagnation in the raw materials markets and the debt problem.The persistence of these forces is a serious obstacle to the development efforts of the countries of the third world  which are thus caught up in a complex and dangerous spiral of the constant deterioration of the world economic situation and the inexorable reduction of their resources  their purchasing power. They are therefore in danger of falling into a state of chronic underdevelopment. At every suitable opportunity the international community emphasizes its concern over this situation  stating that lasting growth for the countries of the third world depends upon increased financial flows to them  more balanced trade and a realistic  concerted approach to solving the problem of indebtedness.Consideration of development and economic growth viewed in these terms was a feature of the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  which took place in Geneva last July. The pragmatism and realism that characterized that Conference should give a new Impetus to the resumption of the North-South dialogue.Among the results that give cause for optimism regarding the likelihood of finding satisfactory solutions to the most urgent economic problems facing the international community are the provisions made to Implement the Common Fund for Commodities.The developing countries whose economies depend largely on the export of their raw materials ate Indeed pleased that UNCTAD has attributed so much Importance to this question and is considering it from the angle of reducing the negative Impact of successive fluctuations in commodity prices. The international community refuses to accept the inevitability of the decline in and instability of prices confronting third-world producers which must deal with the combined effects of the acts and the fall In their revenue in international markets  where raw material prices have collapsed and ate now lower than they have been for 50 years.UNCTAD VII showed that the time has come not for resignation but for realism  the kind of realism that should lead to new efforts to ensure development  taking into account the changes caused by an increasingly obvious interdependence which demands that there be solidarity and complementarity in the promotion of universally shared prosperity. The challenges the third world must face require such an approach  which should be geared towards solutions expressing the collective will to bring about growth and development for the benefit of all parties. In this content the commitments endorsed in UNCTAD should now lead rapidly to concrete actions with a view to overcoming  in solidarity and complementarity  the ongoing crucial problems in the area of international economic relations.The current session of the General Assembly provides an excellent opportunity to bolster the optimism aroused in this respect by the consensus that emerged from the debates at UNCTAD VII and to spell out the priorities that were adopted with regard to improving the lot of the poorest countries.In this spirit  with regards to the clearly expressed desire to channel a larger share of development aid to the least developed countries  the Assembly is called upon to carry out a more thorough debate with a view to having the international community clearly define the ways and means to be mobilized to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of the development of third-world countries. In particular  production capacity must be increased  as must financial resources devoted to development aid; and the constraints inherent in the external debt burden must be alleviated.The debt problem has caused the most acute concern for the third-world countries  in particular African countries. For Africa  the external debt is a heavy burden  a bottle-neck in the development process  for it is one of the many negative factors that are undermining its ability to pay  while the imbalances m international economic trade from which it suffers are being exacerbated.Africa hopes that its partners will take measures to alleviate its external debt burden  which is primarily linked to the economic and financial constraints flowing from deterioration in the terms of trade  together with a deteriorating raw materials prices that create chronic deficits and heighten the crisis in the entire continent  where growth has collapsed.The international community is now well aware of the need to create a more stable economic environment in order to promote development in Africa. More than a year and a half ago the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery 1986-1990. The adoption of that programme was not an end in itself  but an important step in efforts to strengthen active solidarity with a view to restoring African economies.Since that time African countries have  and at great sacrifice  made certain structural changes. Africa has thus demonstrated its willingness to deal  in a responsible manner  with the serious problems jeopardizing its development. It is comforting to note that our partners  for their part  have decided to support the efforts of African countries. This commitment must now take the form of concrete action with measures making it possible to improve the international economic climate and establish development programmes enjoying a significant increase in financial resources originating from both bilateral co-operation and institutions specializing in multilateral co-operation.That is how the constructive dialogue that marked the special session devoted to the economic problems of Africa will - above and beyond enhancing the awareness of priority aspects of the development problems facing an entire continent striving for survival - help to generate efforts aimed at promoting a more active form of solidarity. The Government of Rwanda attaches great importance to the efforts the international community is called upon to make in this connection 	in particular to foster co-operation based on consultations with mutual respect for	each partner and taking into account the needs  realities and interests of everyone in order to reach a genuine contract of solidarity that leads to meeting the challenges of the times and those flowing from the expectations and aspirations that regulate the progress of Individual countries and peoples on the path to development! and provides a constantly renewed dynamism adapted to the needs of the future.Against the background of the concerns arising from the persistent economic crisis  the international community must also deal with political problems that engender Insecurity  tension and even open conflict.This Is true of the explosive situation in southern Africa  which is the result of the practices of the racist minority regime in Pretoria - a regime continually at odds with the international community because of its policy of apartheid  its illegal occupation of Namibia and its acts of destabilization and intimidation against the front-line States.The Pretoria regime stubbornly clings to its outmoded anachronistic policies. It has shown an unwillingness to change that is unacceptable and stubbornly refuses to take into account the legitimate aspirations of the South African majority. It has engaged In stalling manoeuvres to delay the Independence of Namibia and made of Its neighbours targets of its State terrorism.	.The intransigence and arrogance of the champions of the policy of apartheid is an outrage to all countries that cherish peace  justice and freedom and are convinced that the Namibian people must exercise its right to self-determination  that the South African people must be allowed to realize its aspirations to democracy and that the countries of southern African must be allowed to enjoy a climate of security conducive to stability and development.With regard to the problem of Namibia  in particular the Rwanda's Government believes that the settlement plan contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only appropriate framework for a solution in keeping with the need to realize the right of the Namibian people to live In freedom and dignity. In the firm belief that the ethical standards based on the principles of international law will overcome the unacceptable claims of the Pretoria regime  I cannot fail to reaffirm the unswerving support of the Rwanda's Republic for the freedom fighters who are battling this retrograde regime. Similarly  we continue to support the front-line States  which the South African leaders are trying to subdue by making them the victims of blackmail  destabilization and economic sabotage.Apart from the situation in southern Africa  where the odious system of apartheid gives rise to oppression and violence  there are sources of tension elsewhere on the African continent and elsewhere in the world. Notwithstanding the constant appeals made from this rostrum for respect for the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter  which all States Members of our Organization are committed to respect and promote  international peace and security are endangered by the tendency to support the principle that might is right.For certain peoples - in particular the Sahraoui people and the Palestinian people - the implementation of the principle of self-determination is still but a pious wish  while non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and the peaceful settlement of disputes are principles that continue to be violated.The situations Lebanon  Afghanistan and Cambodia  as well as the war between Iran and Iraq  thus continue to be of grave concern to the Organization. Regarding especially the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  the international community must persist in its solemn  repeated appeal to the belligerents to seek an appropriate solution  in keeping with the provisions of the United Nations Charter  to their conflict.The Republic of Rwanda believes that  faced with situations such as these  the establishment of a genuine climate of peace in the world depends on efforts by individual States scrupulously to respect the provisions of the United Nations Charter  while encouraging mutual trust and collective security and rejecting confrontation and violence.At each session the debates in the General Assembly reflect the anxiety of the international community caused by the uncertainties that loom over the future of mankind because of the dangers inherent in the arms race. At the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development stress was rightly laid on the need to promote peace  security and disarmament in the interest of increasing the resources available for the struggle for social and economic progress.The Rwanda delegation hopes that  in keeping with the conclusions reached at the end of that Conference  specific provisions will be adopted to remove the threat to mankind posed by the arms race and to carry out the transfers that would make possible spectacular scientific conquests and impose awareness of the correlation established between disarmament and development  between the needs of security and the expectations of peoples in search of progress and prosperity.In this context  the Government of Rwanda attaches great importance to efforts to intensify the constructive dialogue that will give effect to the conviction that security needs demand ever closer co-ordination with the stakes of development considered in the light of the solidarity and complementarity that are a necessary part of international relations.Whenever appropriate the Government of Rwanda recalls the fact that the Organization recognizes that divided nations are entitled to seek ways and means to regain their unity  without outside interference or pressure. In this spirit  I should like to emphasize once again the Republic of Rwanda's interest in and the importance that it attaches to efforts to further the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. We hope that those efforts  supported by the collective conscience of the German people and responding to their ardent desire to keep that conscience steadfast  will enable them to recover the unity to which they aspire as an integral part of their heritage. Moreover  and still with reference to the United Nations Charter  the Republic of Rwanda supports initiatives aimed at bringing about the independent  peaceful reunification of the Korean nation.The United Nations embodies the sublime ideal of promoting within the international community the values and virtues inherent in aspirations to peace  freedom  justice and social and economic progress. As an institution  it is at the service of peoples which share those aspirations and of Member States  so that they may maintain and develop relations based  above all  on equality and mutual respect  as well as on the awareness that they must act together  co-ordinating their efforts to bring under control the factors and events that influence the future of humanity.I-t is in this spirit that the Republic of Rwanda solemnly reaffirms its unswerving devotion to the principles of the United Nations Charter  in the hope that the dialogue and the concerted effort of Member States will give concrete expression to those principles and reinforce the role of the Organization.In this context  we assure the Assembly that the delegation of Rwanda will play its full part in ensuring that the forty-second session of the General Assembly will contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the Organization.In addressing to you  Mr. President  as other speakers before me have done  heartiest and warmest congratulations  I stress our conviction that your prestige  your long experience and your eminent qualities will help guarantee the success of the work that will be conducted by the Assembly under your leadership.The delegation of Rwanda wishes also to pay a tribute to your predecessor  who directed the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly competently and tactfully. I pay a tribute also to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the steadfast commitment he has shown in carrying out his functions in such a way that our Organization can continue to serve the interests of peace  solidarity and co-operation between nations. His commitment has earned him the great appreciation of the Government of Rwanda.Over and above the success of the work of a session of the General Assembly  the success that the United Nations has in carrying out its mission is and will remain dependent upon the determination of all Member States and of each Member State. There must be a determination to work for a new international order  which can come about only through a policy of entente and co-operation among States  nations and people. There must be a determination to participate in the building of a community based on world-wide solidarity and on co-operation that promotes mutual enrichment and development thanks to the sharing of knowledge and skill  thanks to fruitful exchanges in the spheres of the economy  education  culture  information  science and technology  and thanks to the will continually to broaden the dimensions of international relations  giving priority to those factors that foster balance and harmony. That determination must find concrete expression on every level of the relationships each State hopes to maintain and develop on the international scene  and in signing the United Nations Charter the Republic of Rwanda evidenced it. Guided by the Charter's inherent spirit  Rwanda will always play its part in efforts to bring about the triumph of the ideal to which we subscribed 25 years ago  an ideal that put the world on the path of dialogue  solidarity and complementarity with a view to fulfilling the aspirations of all peoples for peace and prosperity."
"121",6043,"SAU",42,1987,"﻿It is my pleasure to congratulate the President on his election at this forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. His election reflects the personal esteem he enjoys and reinforces the role of his country in supporting international efforts and strengthening the bonds of international co-operation. I am convinced that his competence will be an effective factor in enabling the General Assembly to conclude its work in the best possible manner. He has always been recognized in United Nations circles as one of its most prominent personalities.I should like to take this opportunity also to express to Mr. Humayun Choudhury  the President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  our deep appreciation of his effective role in dealing with the various problems that occurred  including the administrative and financial crisis that faced the United Nations  as well as his role in helping the United Nations to emerge  at the end of that session  stronger in our conscience and in the conscience of the nations of the world.In this respect  I should like to reiterate our appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who worked  and is still working  with sincerity and diligence  to solve the internal problems of the United Nations and guide its international efforts towards the achievement of its basic objectives. He does so with impartiality  objectivity  and a sense of the great responsibility he shoulders  and we support him in his efforts. The foreign policy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  a country that embraces the religion of Islam and applies the tolerant Islamic shariah  is implemented on the basis of the principles upon which the United Nations was founded and the noble objectives for which its Charter was promulgated  these being a reaffirmation of what Islamic law stipulates for the conduct of international relations. As the Custodian of the Two Holy Places  King Fahd bin Abdul-Aziz noted  in an address he delivered on the eve of Saudi Arabia's National Day last week  that Islamic belief is an integral doctrine which is based on mercy  compassion  solidarity  brotherhood and mutual respect and is devoid of oppression  deceit and treachery.On this basis  we reaffirm our determination to work in support of the United Nations and its specialized agencies  as they are the proper framework for co-operation between nations and peoples and the effective means for settling conflicts between States.The United Nations has established rules of conduct for relations between nations and States as laid down in the Charter  and its universality has given that framework the force of a legal commitment in all aspects of world concerns. There is no dimension of human endeavour in which the Organization does not forge a constructive role and strive to keep pace with the tremendous scientific  technological and economic strides that have been made in the twentieth century. This development has reduced differences between peoples and bridged the chasm between States. It has narrowed the gaps between communities and opened wide the door to international co-operation  so that the United Nations  through all its agencies  bodies and branches  has become a basic  indispensable element in Saudi Arabia) international affairs  while its fundamental objectives challenge the ability of its Members to give effect to the purposes and principles of the Charter.The basic demand of the peoples of the world today is for peace and stability. The use of war as a means of resolving conflicts is totally rejected. There is no doubt  however  that continued success in this direction must be linked to a commitment by Member States to the letter and spirit of the Charter. Such commitment is the only guarantee of the realization of international peace and security  because it guarantees the establishment of normal  fair and balanced relations among all States  irrespective of their size  location  military strength or political  economic and social regime. Perhaps one of the most formidable challenges confronting the United Nations today concerns the wide gap between commitment to the principles of the Charter and the actual behaviour of States in their international relations  especially those States  such as Israel and South Africa  that persist in aggression  oppression  terrorism and discrimination. Should the Organization fail to take timely  definitive and responsible action  it will jeopardize its credibility and its effectiveness in ensuring the commitment of its Members to the Charter and the purposes and principles it set out therein.In seeking improved co-operation  we should take account of recent experience and consider the obstacles that face the United Nations and hamper the prospects of greater co-operation  which is vital for peace  stability and growth. The countries whose practices violate the Charter must bear the full responsibility for creating those obstacles. Hence  we should consider the means set forth in the Charter for dealing with these violations. The insistence upon aggression  violation of the principles of the Charter and rejection of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council pose a challenge to the Charter which should prompt us to act firmly to secure compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter. Reluctance to do so indicates an abdication of responsibility and abandonment of one of the most fundamental principles of the Charter. In addition to a substantial series of international violations of and acts of aggression against the rights and freedoms of peoples  we also have before us a long list of economic and social problems that still await wise remedies based on a sense of communal responsibility and a balanced approach to co-operation  matched by a sense of commitment to the moral and legal responsibilities which all of us should respect and fulfil.We face this year  as we have faced for the past 40 years  the question of Palestine and the Middle East and the core of that conflict  the question of Al Quds Al Sharif  which arise from Israeli aggression against Arab lands  the Arab inhabitants of Palestine and other peoples in the neighbouring Arab countries  as well as aggression against the Islamic nations and the Islamic Ultima  especially in Al Quds Л1 Sharif  the first kibla and third Holiest Shrine. We do not believe that any problem or issue has become clearer and more evident in all its aspects to the whole world than has the problem of Palestine. There is no problem in which wrong challenges right every day more clearly than in the case of the problem of Palestine. The United Nations has never before faced such a challenge to its will and such an assault upon its Charter as it has faced  and continues to face  through the persistence of Zionist aggression against the Arab people within and outside Palestine. The tragic circumstances and sad situation from which Lebanon is suffering constitute one of the acute consequences of this problem.Peace is the demand of all humanity today  peace based on justice  and justice is the foundation of stability and the basis for its continuation. But the objective of peace has become the victim of those that reject it. Israel has spaced no effort to thwart peace initiatives. It has persisted in aggression and its concerted effort to disrupt the possibility of peace. It has become evident that peace can be established in our region only through recognition of the inalienable  legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.Israel's obstinacy and persistent attempts to disrupt peace Initiatives in order to gain time to achieve its objectives and designs will lead only to more trouble and to consequences that will increase the difficulty of solving the problem  with all the consequent risks and dangers. There is no clearer proof of this than Israel's deliberate attempts to put obstacles and difficulties in the path of the efforts aimed at convening an international conference.It is hardly necessary for me to reaffirm here that no attempt to find a solution can be successful unless it includes the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  as a party and a factor in negotiations and dialogue. The Arab countries fulfilled their historical responsibility to ensure peace and made the best offer they could for the establishment of peace and stability in the region when they announced their framework for the peace process In the historic decision in Fez in 1982  which emphasized the Arab consensus on peace based upon justice. In accordance with international law and in compliance with the international will as represented by United Nations resolutions. The war between Iraq and Iran  which has entered its eighth year  has assumed new dimensions which threaten the security of the region and world peace. Developments of recent months carry ominous overtones as to what continued opposition to end the war might lead and in what continued disregard of conventions and international resolutions to put an end to it might result. We call for the termination of this destructive war afflicting the Iraqi and Iranian peoples  not only for the sake and in the interests of all peoples  but also for the sake of the peace and stability of the region and the preservation of the vital interests of the countries of the region. Those who work for its continuation are sacrificing the basic interests of the Iraqi and Iranian peoples and exposing the region and world peace to the gravest dangers.Iran continues to extend its war with Iraq to non-participants by arrogating to itself the right to attack non-belligerent countries  assault the interests of other countries  and threaten international navigation in the Gulf. This perverted and dangerous logic is the main reason for the instability  extreme tension  and deplorable deterioration of the situation in the Gulf region. If Iran assumes the right to attack countries not parties to the conflict  then it is only natural that each country in the region has the full right to defend itself against aggression.The continuation of the conflict and the threats by which Iran attempts to extend its scope in the Gulf region  going so far as to attack ships of other countries which are not parties to the conflict  and its continuous threats to the freedom of navigation in the Gulf are the cause of the presence of international fleets in the Gulf waters. At their meeting in Tunisia the Arab Foreign Ministers unanimously asked Iran not to make its actions the cause for drawing international conflict to the region but  rather  for establishing peace and security therein. It also called on all peace-loving nations of the world to urge Iran to accept the will of the international community to end its war with Iraq quickly. We take this opportunity to call upon Iran  again  from this international forum  to refrain from acts of aggression and threats against the Arab Gulf countries and to take part in the quest to establish peace and stability in the region — a responsibility of the countries of the region and the States Members of the United Nations.While expressing our appreciation for Iraq's position and readiness to halt the war and terminate the conflict in accordance United Nations resolutions  I should also like to reiterate the support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for Security Council resolution 598 (1987)   which provides for the peace and security of the parties to the conflict and regional and international stability. The Arab countries have unanimously supported that resolution and urged the United Nations and the Secretary-General to intensify their endeavours and assume their responsibilities to implement it.It is regrettable that the Iranian response - in the statement delivered by the President of Iran a few days ago - to that resolution and United Nations efforts aimed at putting an end to the war and establishing peace completely closes the door on those attempts and destroys hopes for an end to the tragic and destructive war. This requires that the United Nations take a firm decisive stand by securing the necessary measures to implement the aforementioned resolution  also it requires that the Security Council  in particular  take a decision without delay to implement resolution 598 (1987) which includes the imposition of sanctions against the party that does not implement that resolution in accordance with the United Nations Charter.Iran was not content just with its war with Iraq - a war which went on to spread disruption and chaos in the region  exposing the area to the risks of foreign intervention and  ultimately  propelling it into an international conflict - but has also threatened the security and stability not only of its Arab neighbours but of those outside the Gulf as well. It has missed no opportunity during the past few years to demonstrate hostility towards those countries. It carried out destructive activities in the State of Kuwait and launched its rockets against fully populated civilian areas. It placed mines in the Gulf waters and helped push the region into a storm of hostility and turmoil. The Iranian regime has become a unique case in rejecting international conventions and violating laws  norms and traditions that guide the international community  as well as deviating from the proper course of diplomatic relations. There is no clearer evidence of that than the Iranian authorities' violation of the sanctity of the Saudi and Kuwaiti embassies in Tehran  their flagrant occupation  plunder and destruction of those premises  and the mistreatment of their staff resulting in the death of a Saudi diplomat.Islam is completely alien to such an approach and all those practices. Never since the light of guidance accompanied the Message of the prophet Mohammed - may peace and the blessing of God be upon him - has Islam been a source of extremism and terrorism. This just religion has never been one of intolerance  hate and fanaticism  but one of openness  tolerance and goodwill among all peoples.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has tried during the past eight years to maintain normal relations with Iran in the hope of preserving links and maintaining good-neighbourliness; it has tolerated many acts and provocations against itself and its people. But Iran has missed no opportunity during those years to demonstrate a hostile attitude towards the Kingdom and the Arab Gulf countries.It is regrettable that the President of Iran  from this international rostrum  made allegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that he knows  and we know  are untrue  and which evidence has proved false. It is also regrettable that the President of a country with a civilization steeped in the roots of history and whose Muslim population has always been a stronghold Of Islam and a builder of civilization has come to list in this international forum  which represents the world's conscience  a series of falsifications and mischievous accusations in clear defiance of the tolerant principles of Islam and the noble and original ethics of the Iranian people  and in flagrant violation and disregard of the values and norms of Islam. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was  and still is  careful to keep the differences between Islamic countries in their proper Islamic context. It has always dealt with these problems guided by the teachings of its just Islamic religion  avoiding demagoguery and vituperation. On that basis  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that the complete isolation and unanimous Arab and Islamic condemnation of Iran today is the proper response to such false allegations and practices  because allegation and falsification cannot remove the evidence of the horrendous crime that the Iranian authorities committed in Mecca  in the vicinity of the Holy Mosque of God  during the Holy Month. It is a sacred shrine that represents the Great Islamic Symbol which hearts yearn for. This atrocious crime took place not in the dark or in secret  but under the eyes and ears of millions of Muslims.All the Islamic countries and institutions  organizations and centres - indeed  the whole world community - have condemned these criminal acts by Iran. We hope that the international reaction  and particularly the Islamic reaction  will make the Iranian leaders realize that they cannot convince people by force  terrorism and violence. They can get their message across only by becoming advocates of peace  brotherhood and kindness  the objectives whose core and foundation represent the real message of Islam  inspired by the divine revelation: ""Invite (all) to the Way Of thy Lord with wisdom And beautiful preaching}And argue with them In ways that are best And most gracious:For thy Lord knoweth best.Who have strayed from His Path And who receive guidance."" (The Holy Koran  XVI: 125)We were optimistic after the last session that there would be a just solution to the problem of Afghanistan. However  it is regrettable that the situation still remains the same. The foreign occupation is still continuing  and the Muslim Afghan people are struggling with all the means at their disposal  sacrificing the blood of their sons in defence of their religion and homeland  and sustaining the most extreme difficulties in order to resist the occupation  demanding withdrawal from their land and the establishment of a governmental system which Is acceptable to them.While we reaffirm our fullest support for the just struggle of the Mujahidin  we still look forward to a positive response from the Soviet Union  a super-Power  to United Nations decisions  the decisions of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the appeals of the world for a quick withdrawal from Afghanistan  a free and independent country throughout history.While we support the efforts of the United Nations to arrive at an acceptable solution which can guarantee the return of all the refugees to their homes  non-interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and the preservation of Islamic identity  we still hope that should such a solution become possible  the relations between the two neighbouring countries - the Soviet Union and Afghanistan - will evolve into relations of good-neighbourliness and mutual respect.We also take this opportunity to reiterate our appreciation of the important role played by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the sacrifices being borne by its people in hosting more than 3.5 million Afghan refugees on its soil  despite the economic and security burdens Pakistan is trying to shoulder. We call upon the nations of the world to co-operate with Pakistan in this great effort. The problem of Namibia and the racist policy adopted by South Africa are among the issues that we greatly care about  and they fall within the realm of the responsibilities we share with the African nations. On this basis  we call upon the international community of the United Nations to intensify its efforts to end the era of apartheid and colonialism in that part of the world.The co-operation and alliance between the Zionist regime in Palestine and the Pretoria regime in South Africa  which are united by similar designs and common means and ideas  puts a double responsibility on the United Nations to implement the requirements of its Charter  as well as on Member States to be committed to their obligation to end the era of oppression  apartheid  violation of international conventions and the use of brute force against peaceful peoples.South Africa's attacks on neighbouring African States will only increase the isolation of this racist regime  and will not save it from the final reckoning which is the ultimate fate of all oppressors. We in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stand by the African States  with which we are linked by the closest historic  religious and geographic ties  in their firm rejection of the policy of South Africa and in demanding full independence for Namibia. We call for firm implementation of the resolutions on an economic and political boycott of the Pretoria regime  until the Pretoria Government adheres to the decisions of the United Nations. We also deplore the close alliance between South Africa and Israel  whether overt or covert  in the economic  nuclear  strategic and political fields.Economic problems are still among the most important obstacles to international understanding  at a time when they should be among the most important bridges for co-operation between nations. It is regrettable that last year was no better than the year before  because  despite the recent attempts in this respect  economic recovery is still facing concrete obstacles  and the international monetary system is still suffering from many problems. The instability of exchange rates is also causing a substantial disruption in the economies of the developing countries in particular. Moreover  the decline in the prices of raw materials in the developing countries  despite the rise in the prices of manufactured products imported by them from industrial countries  is a serious obstacle to their development and to the growth of international trade. The continuation of protectionist trends in some industrial countries is also increasing the difficulties confronting the expansion of international trade.On the other hand  the attempts to activate the negotiations between North and South are also still stumbling. The developing countries are facing increased difficulties in meeting the responsibilities of development  because the fully developed countries have not adequately done their duty to co-operate with them in solving their problems. We all know that a large number of the developing countries inherited their economic burdens and the consequences of economic backwardness from foreign regimes which occupied their land and managed their affairs until their independence  achieved over the past 40 years.In this regard we look forward to a strengthening of the role of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in addressing the problems I have referred to in a manner that enhances the solution of monetary problems and facilitates and frees international trade by removing the impediments and obstacles that have caused the developing countries to suffer  in order to arrive at a fair adjustment between developing nations and the fully developed ones. The collective responsibility for solving these problems should be reaffirmed  to avoid confrontations which we know would ultimately lead to further problems  whether in the economic or the political field.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has always been careful to fulfil its commitments and carry out its obligations within the collective responsibility for the economic stability and development of the world. We hope to continue this  with the co-operation of other countries. We have always called for a revival of North-south negotiations and the exertion of persistent efforts in dealing with the economic problems facing the developing countries.The recent Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development provoked great interest  because the two subjects have a direct bearing upon International peace and security  while both are linked to the development and welfare of nations. We reaffirm that development  by the momentum it creates  and disarmament  with its wide-ranging consequences  are two important and effective factors in ensuring stability; removing the fears and doubts that separate nations and channelling the potential of nations towards ends more beneficial than the acquisition of weapons of slaughter and destruction. If this is to be possible there must be a sense of international responsibility in all countries working towards the elimination of the causes of oppression and tyranny to which we have referred and of the causes of injustice suffered by all peoples vulnerable to occupation and aggression. The diversion of the potential of nations  whether financially stable or not  from military to economic production will increase the possibilities for international co-operation in all its forms.As we start a new year in the calendar of the United Nations  we look forward to a new era of international co-operation in solving the political and social problems that go beyond the narrow confines of each State. We look forward to overcoming the obstacles and difficulties facing international co-operation in the attempts to solve problems and guide the international community to advanced stages of co-operation that will lead to political and economic stability and enable all of us to face the challenges of the future with confidence and optimism."
"122",6080,"SDN",42,1987,"﻿It is my pleasure to extend to you  Sir  the warm congratulations of my country on your election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. Your election to this high office reflects the international community s appreciation of your outstanding abilities. I wish you success in conducting the affairs of this session.Allow me also  Sir  to convey to your predecessor my country's deep appreciation of the wisdom and ability with which he presided over the work of the previous session.Democracy is the best option of the peoples of the free world. Our Sudanese people has unanimously opted for democracy and adamantly clings to liberty. The Sudanese have experienced dictatorship and military rule at first hand.It is a source of pride for me to be able to state that my country has now succeeded in building a number of multilateralist democratic institutions. Our belief in political democracy must of necessity lead to the democratisation of our country's economic and social life. Thus the fabric of democratic rule would become whole. It is for this reason that the Sudan strives after economic and social development. This is no easy task in a country as vast as ours which  as a third world country suffers from the accumulated problems of the past and the present  which beset its endeavours vis-à-vis the challenges of the future.The nascent democratic experience in Sudan faces numerous internal and external challenges. Therefore  it needs the support of all the democratic forces of the world. Experience has shown that the developing nations can find it beyond their reach to tread the path of democracy in the face of the difficult problems which stand in their way.My country is a case in point. Only the concerted efforts of the international  community represented by the United Nations system and friendly countries  threw us a lifeline when we faced the horror of famine. The problems facing my country are the following: first  the problem of drought and desertification. This is one of the most dangerous threats to life for man and animal alike in the continent of Africa to which the Sudan belongs. It is a deadly threat because it begets famine and its attendant miseries. Therefore  it calls for regional and international co-operation in the study of its root causes and practicable preventive measures. It also calls for the provision of the material and technical means that would make possible the study and the development of such measures. In this respect  my country commends the efforts of the United Nations and its specialized agencies and calls for the continued assistance of the entire international community.Secondly  the refugee problem. For more than three decades now  Sudan has become the recipient of ever increasing numbers of refugees. It has adopted a constantly hospitable policy vis-à-vis this problem. This was only natural in the case of a country with its deeply rooted traditions of hospitality and a strong commitment to the relevant regional and international instruments. However  the influx of refugees is on the increase  especially in the eastern  western and southern areas of the country. Refugees now constitute more than 10 per cent of the total population of the country. Obviously  this has created excessive pressures which the country's economic and human capabilities cannot withstand.While the Sudan fully abides by the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of its neighbours  it favours the voluntary return of the refugees to their countries of origin. The Sudan will spare no effort in seeking appropriate ways and means to achieve the national reconciliation which would ensure the voluntary return of the refugees to their countries. In the meantime    is necessary to organize the refugee situation in such a way as to ensure their safety  and provide them with the necessary health and educational facilities without overburdening the country's means or jeopardizing the security and Well-being of Sudanese society.While we deeply appreciate the support of the international community in this connection  my delegation looks forward to more efforts being made to find lasting solutions to the root causes of the refugee problem and to step up the relief operations.In this connection  Sudan welcomes all missions dispatched by the world body. We also highly commend the report of the specialized inter-agency mission which visited Sudan last year and warmly welcome the mission now assessing our country's needs in relation to the refugee problem. Sudan also sets great store by the implementation of all the recommendations relating to the linkage of relief assistance to development efforts in the refugee areas.In the context of the collective responsibility of the international community in addressing the problem of refugees  my delegation wishes to give notice that we all face an extremely grave situation which will deteriorate further unless all the United Nations resolutions and recommendations relating to the refugees are fully and urgently implemented.The third problem facing my country is that of indebtedness. The present democratic Government in the Sudan inherited  among other problems  a heavy burden of external debts which were incurred  on the one hand  as a result of the reckless policies of the deposed military regime and  on the other  because of the worsening of the acute international economic crisis. The cost of debt servicing now exceeds our export earnings. Sudan  like other less developed nations  is unable to strike a balance between the repayment of its debts and the continued provision of urgently necessary and basic services to its people. The debt situation  in our view  calls for mote concerted efforts on the part of the international community and the immediate development of creative remedial solutions. It also calls for new and more concessional repayment and rescheduling over more extended periods of time  with longer grace periods.In this context  my delegation welcomes the positive signs which indicate the earnestness of the international community in seeking a solution to the debt problem. We welcome also the final statement of the recent Venice summit of the Western industrialized countries. We sincerely hope that those intentions will be translated into practical  positive steps. Together with other African countries  my delegation calls for the convening of an international conference to consider the ever-escalating problem of African indebtedness.The current world economic situation continues to affect adversely the economies of many countries of the world  particularly in Africa. Those are countries which face deteriorating conditions that make it extremely difficult even to think of formulating plans of economic and social development. Lack of foreign exchange is not the primary difficulty in that respect. In many instances it is the inability to provide the local components required for the implementation of development plans that is the greatest difficulty. By the end of this decade  all the countries of the world  regardless of wealth  will face grim prospects that will threaten their very existence  unless North and South join hands and co-operate in all economic areas. Such concerted efforts will require greater sacrifices and concessions on the part of the developed nations and more diligence on the part of the developing nations in putting their house in order and redressing their administrative and financial infrastructure to eliminate shortcomings and adverse elements.We have continued to call  from this rostrum and in other forums  for the sort of genuine and effective international interdependence that would meet all our needs. Our world has become so compact and interdependent as to make all its small nations vulnerable to the repercussions of any policy decision by any of the industrialized countries.We remain convinced that a proper formula for addressing economic backwardness and the problems of development will never be achieved under the existing inequitable international economic order. An equitable formula is essential if we are to protect the rights of producers of primary commodities and make them compatible with the interests of the manufacturers.The hope of a new international economic order  though distant  still seduces the peoples of the third world. None the less  we concede that it is incumbent upon our Governments to rationalize their economic and fiscal policies. In this respect  we wish to put it on record that many African Governments have taken considerable steps towards the achievement of that goal in line with the resolutions of the African Steering Committee. However  the African attempts at rationalization have not been matched by a parallel attempt at economic rescue. While the returns on our commodities have slumped  the costs of agriculture inputs and other manufactured goods have soared. Aid has dried up  our export earnings have fallen. We are indeed caught in a vicious circle.The United Nations was created primarily to maintain international peace  ensure security  bring about international co-operation in the economic and social fields  foster the principles of good-neighbourliness  resolve disputes by peaceful means and ensure non-interference by any State in the internal affairs of others. We have acted to translate those lofty purposes and principles into guidelines in the conduct o£ our foreign policy and our relations with our neighbours and the other countries of the world.It is the duty of Members of the United Nations to demonstrate the Organization's credibility and reaffirm its world role. We can do that by showing respect for the spirit and the letter of the Charter  applying its principles and adhering to them in coping with international problems. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Charter  the partisan  self-seeking approach of some countries at the expense of the international community's interests and the tendency of certain States to bypass the United Nations in dealing with disputes constitute  in our opinion  an infringement of the commitments of Member States with regard to the Organization and a retreat from what the world had agreed upon when this Organization was created.The achievements of the United Nations are a source of pride to us all. We believe that this is the view of all Member States. However  there are evident shortcomings. The Organization is still unable to ensure independence and sovereignty for the Palestinian people on their native soil. It has failed to achieve the independence of Namibia. It has failed to put an end to the heinous policies of apartheid practised by the white minority in South Africa. And it has failed to curb the nuclear and conventional arms races.The United Nations continues to face a naked challenge in the Middle East. The situation there is deteriorating. The adoption of yet more resolutions to be added to those already on the records of the Organization would no longer be useful. The dimensions and origins of this question are clear enough. The international community is well aware that peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without justice. The Organization's resolutions state that quite clearly. The Palestinian question is the crux of the conflict in the Middle East and its root cause. There can be no peace in the Middle East without Israel's total and unconditional withdrawal from all the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967f including Al-Quds Al-Sharif# that is# the Holy City of Jerusalem.Israel's continued disregard of United Nations resolutions  its contempt for the international consensus and its persistent and flagrant violation of the Charter are  in our view  the cause of the deteriorating situation in the region.In view of all this  we reaffirm once more the importance of convening an international conference on peace in the Middle Last  in accordance with the 1983 Geneva Declaration on Palestine  endorsed by this Assembly. The international conference should be held under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.My country watches with sorrow and anxiety the Iran-Iraq war  which has entered its eighth year. That war has exacted a heavy toll in lives and resources of the two countries  with which we have close spiritual and historical ties. The developments arising from that conflict have created a new situation fraught with danger for the security of the region and the peace of the world. My delegation commends Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which is proof enough of the wish of the international community to see an immediate end to the conflict. We also commend the efforts of the Secretary-General towards the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  and hope that he will continue his mission of good offices and achieve a comprehensive and honourable settlement to this protracted dispute.Many years have passed since the international community voiced its first unequivocal condemnation of the abhorrent crime of apartheid practised by the racist minority in South Africa. None the less  the racist Pretoria regime continues to defy the international will  and ignore the world Organization's resolutions  following the lead of its twin  the Zionist entity in Israel.The overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa are still deprived of their basic human rights and subjected to the most brutal measures of oppression and racial violence. From this podium  we salute the struggle of the South African people and laud their just cause. We reiterate our unflinching support for their just revolution under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania. We also reiterate our conviction that the dismantling of the abhorrent system of apartheid and the realization of the aspirations of the African majority in South Africa can be achieved only through the cornering of the Pretoria regime and imposition of a total embargo and comprehensive sanctions against it under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The world is duty-bound to undertake further concerted action in support of the just struggle of the people of South Africa in order to bring about the long awaited change in that part of the African continent. The international community has reiterated often enough its condemnation of the racist regime's continued illegal occupation of Namibia and its plundering of the wealth of that Territory. All the African States agree that there must be a peaceful democratic solution to this problem. However  the manoeuvres of the racist regime continue to obstruct and thwart every effort aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace. It should be emphasized here that the only acceptable framework for a comprehensive  urgent and peaceful settlement of this problem is Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  Until such time as that resolution is implemented  there is no alternative but to support the struggle of the people of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization until the attainment of full Namibian independence and sovereignty over its entire territory. We therefore call upon all peace-loving nations to continue to support that people's just struggle for liberation.We listened attentively to the statement of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  which gave details concerning the policy of national reconciliation recently declared by the government of Afghanistan and its new intention to make Afghanistan an independent non-aligned country. We are of the view that unless all foreign troops are withdrawn from all Afghan territory  realization of the aspirations of the Afghan people to national reconciliation  complete independence and non-alignment will remain remote.We share the view that national reconciliation is but another facet of peaceful coexistence  a principle which we have embraced as a guiding light for our policy. Such national reconciliation  in Afghanistan or in Kampuchea  cannot be achieved without the total withdrawal of all foreign forces from those countries. Withdrawal would be the starting-point and the essential springboard for national reconciliation. The arms race has pushed all nations  especially those in possession of huge arsenals  to the brink of a very dangerous situation and has caused them to manufacture ever increasing quantities of new  more lethal weapons. Like other developing countries  my country looks with anxiety and alarm upon the vast resources being squandered on nuclear and conventional armaments at a time when millions in Africa and the rest of the third world are dying of hunger and millions are suffering from disease  poverty and ignorance.In recent years  the arms race has sucked in certain developing countries under the pressure of regional conflicts. The acquisition of weapons by those countries has placed a heavy burden on their resources  hampered their development programmes  put them deeper in debt and exacerbated their economic problems.Despite all this  we feel heartened by the initial agreement in principle between the United States of America and the Soviet Union on the elimination of short-range and medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. We hope that this significant step will be followed by further steps towards the cessation of the arras race.We hope too that the Conference on Disarmament will be able to formulate a comprehensive test-ban treaty that would prohibit nuclear testing in the atmosphere  underground and under water. The conclusion of such an agreement is a prerequisite for an end to vertical and horizontal nuclear proliferation.The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which recently concluded its deliberations here in New York  was a landmark; it affirmed the principles of multilateralism in disarmament negotiations  and highlighted the link between disarmament and development. For the first time in the history of international relations  the Conference succeeded by promoting acceptance of the principle of trade and development. The very fact that it was possible to convene the Conference sent a strong message to the major Powers that disarmament negotiations are no longer the preserve of nuclear Powers. The Conference recognized too that non-military threats are among the dangers facing regional and international peace and security.Although the final document of the Conference was adopted by consensus  it fell short of the hopes and aspirations of developing countries  which are the prime victims of the arms race and of its negative impact upon their security and their social and economic development. Nevertheless  my delegation sees in the Conference a beginning of a long path which may lead to success if we show the resolve to affirm the principle of collective security  as envisioned by the Charter. In conclusion and notwithstanding the foregoing  we meet at the forty-second session in hope and optimism. We feel optimism because the international Organization has restored its credibility and regained its ability to cope with hotbeds of tension and solve conflicts between its Members forcefully and with firm perseverance  and because Member States have recognized that the obnoxious system of apartheid cannot be reformed and must be eradicated  and the major Members of this Organization have begun the march towards disarmament. Another reason for optimism is that the international community has highlighted the grave and imminent dangers that threaten our world. Moreover  there is growing progress regarding the peace initiatives in Central America  and constructive bilateral and multilateral consultations are now under way to solve the critical situation in Angola  which could accelerate the attainment of complete independence for Namibia. It is our earnest hope that this optimism will prove justified."
"123",6125,"SEN",42,1987,"﻿Your election  Mr. President  is both recognition of the continuing endeavours of the German Democratic Republic for peace and harmony between peoples and a tribute to your great qualities as an experienced statesman and diplomat. I am therefore pleased to offer you the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Senegal and to wish you every success in the discharge of your mandate.Your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury of Bangladesh  with his lucidity  wisdom and ability  inspired and successfully presided over the last session  I once again extend to him our thanks.I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mt. Javier Perez de Cuellar  a man of conviction  initiative and courage  who deserves our appreciation and support. I also welcome Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed  in whom we have complete confidence  and congratulate him on his selection by the Secretary-General  which was well deserved. This forty-second session of the General Assembly is beginning its work in an atmosphere of expectation and hope.Our common resolve is to continue the work of building a more balanced and more just world - particularly since the holding two years ago of the fortieth anniversary session of this Organization - has enabled us to glimpse  and sometimes even see  an outline of solutions to some of the major challenges of our age. We must persevere because  above and beyond national stakes and interests  our common efforts are aimed at one objective; to promote the dignity of each individual and of every people through international co-operation. This great noble undertaking - and we have a historic responsibility to future generations to achieve it – requires of all of us lucidity  political will and active solidarity.It is in this spirit that I would speak on behalf of Mr. Abdou Diouf President of the Republic of Senegal  and bring to the Assembly the modest but sincere contribution of the Senegalese people and Government to the implementation of the programme for the rehabilitation of man and peoples in their common rights to peace  development and progress. In this context  re-establishing a growth economy  promoting and protecting human rights and maintaining international peace and security constitute three topics of burning relevance today. May I be permitted to dwell on them for a few moments and share our thoughts with the Assembly.At a time when the developing countries have the greatest need for financial resources to ensure their growth  what we are witnessing is in fact a reverse trend: in 1985 the developing countries carried out a net transfer of resources of $US 31 billion to the developed countries  and in 1986 this situation not only continued but also worsened. In this context we believe that the North-South dialogue is more than mere wishful thinking; rather  it is an imperative to be translated into tangible action at a time when interdependence between nations is the backdrop to international relations.The New Substantive Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries and also  what is closer to us  the United Nations Programme of Action for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa  1986-1990  if successfully concluded in a spirit of active harmony and solidarity  could help to restore the economic health of many countries of the South that are represented here and thus improve the future of their  peoples.As we are all aware  this United Nations Programme of Action for Africa enshrines commitments solemnly entered into here by one and all - by African Governments and by the international community.Since the Secretary-General has already prepared a detailed follow-up report on the matter  it would be superfluous for me to dwell excessively on the work done by our Organization to implement that Programme of Action. However  Senegal would like to hail the many initiatives taken by the Secretary-General  such as the establishment of a Steering Committee of the United Nations  the establishment of a Group of Eminent Persons  and the interagency meetings held in Dakar in March 1986. The continuation of these efforts  together with co-ordination work  and efforts towards implementation at the regional level by the Economic Commission for Africa  should make it possible to strengthen the capacity of the international organizations to respond in time to difficulties encountered in implementing the Programme of Action. Part of the international community also responded positively to the debt problem and debt servicing that detract from the adjustment efforts of African countries. My country welcomes the decision taken in this regard by several countries to cancel or to convert into bonds the public debt entered into by African countries that have been seriously affected by the crisis. We trust that this effort of active solidarity will encourage other partners of Africa  if not to take the same political step  at least to take initiatives with the same goal of providing the African countries real relief from the crushing burden of their foreign debts.The African countries  for their part  are not sitting with their arms folded in the face of the critical situation confronting their economies. After all  they have solemnly stated that they must first count on their own efforts to solve the problem.I should like to mention briefly the case of my own country  Senegal.According to the World Bank's Consultative Group for Senegal  which met in Paris from 31 March to 1 April 1987:""Two years ago the Government of Senegal began an extremely courageous and large-scale programme for economic restructuring and institutional reform. While no one questions the need for such measures  some persons were sceptical as to the tenacity and courage needed of the public authorities to be able to follow this difficult path which had just been mapped out. Others  invoking the fragility of the Senegalese economy and the difficulties inherent in such change  had doubted whether the measures would in fact lead to real improvement in Senegal's economic situation. Nevertheless  despite these apprehensions  an agreement was concluded between Senegal and its creditors. ""Two years after the beginning of this undertaking it would seem to us that  as we look at the progress made  a very clear consensus has emerged whereby the Senegalese Government has to a large extent attained its objectives and in fact achieved far better success than many would have ventured to hope.""Anxious to benefit to the utmost from the experience gained in implementing its adjustment programme  my Government opted for an institutional and functional development of existing structures following upon the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly  on the critical economic situation of Africa.	 Thus at the institutional level  the Inter-Ministerial Committee which  under the effective chairmanship of the Head of State  meets quarterly to supervise implementation of the adjustment programme  and the Technical Committee  which provides follow-up during the inter-quarterly periods  have had their membership changed so as to include all of the ministerial departments involved in the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action.On the functional level  the powers of the Inter-Ministerial Committee and the Technical Committee have been broadened to include follow-up and Implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action. Thus the Technical Committee meets on a monthly basis with the creditors in order to study development projects and programmes and together with our partners  hold economic and financial negotiations as needed.Thanks to these institutional and functional reforms  the assistance provided by organizations in the United Nations system is directed towards the adjustment programme  the priority programme and the United Nations Programme  thereby strengthening the co-ordinating capacity of the Government in the priority areas. These institutional and organic measures and initiatives are backed up by major economic reforms to respond to the priority programme of modalities and objectives of the United Nations Programme of Action.In the area of public finances  public expenditures representing 32 per cent of the gross national product in 1980-1981  amounted to only 21 per cent of the gross national product in 1985-1986. In 1987  despite the heavy burden of debt-servicing  which accounts for 40 per cent of budget income and almost 25 per cent of export earnings  the deficit is now only 1 per cent of the gross national product  and there has been a sharp drop in the commitments of the public authorities to the banking system and enterprises Senegal has also adopted new agricultural and industrial policies in order to stimulate production and growth.The new agricultural policy is designed essentially to diversify agricultural output; to ensure food self-sufficiency; to ensure that the State is no longer involved in certain activities; to ensure the direct responsibility of the rural population and the peasants; to establish a credit bank to be managed by the peasants Instead of the State; and to provide new impetus for production co-operatives. And there are several other measures  including the setting of remunerative prices for agricultural products.The new industrial policy was instituted in 1986 and is intended to remedy the lack of dynamism and competitiveness in industry. The Government undertook to remove the State from this sector so as to promote private investment  which is essential to re-growth in the secondary sector. This industrial development strategy required corrective intervention mechanisms and techniques. To that end  the State established an inter-ministerial structure to take effective action in restructuring enterprises that were in difficulty. In order to ensure greater investment  the State organizes regular meetings with creditors by holding sectoral meetings and meetings of potential private investors.Lastly  studies are now under way and measures have been taken to minimize the impact of structural adjustment on the social sector.That  in brief  is a summary of a few aspects of the implementation of the programmes undertaken by Senegal. We solemnly reaffirm our will to persevere on this path of organized and planned adjustment of our economy. Nevertheless  and this is a very important point  these efforts have involved sacrifices on our part in the area of employment and the social sector in particular. Such sacrifices will prove viable for Senegal and for other countries undertaking such reforms only if there is active support and real commitment from the international community.Of course  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have established special mechanisms for reform programmes in Africa. Donors have indeed carried out the eighth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association (IDA) amounting to $12 billion  and the World Bank has decided to raise to 45 per cent the IDA resources for investment in Africa south of the Sahara. The International Fund for Agricultural Development and the Food and Agricultural Organization have also committed themselves to specific programmes for the countries of Africa.However important those efforts may be  they cannot conceal the even more important and major efforts that remain to be made. That is why Senegal ardently hopes that in the near future the response of the community of donors will deal more with official development aid  on the one hand  and  on the other  with an agreed approach to easing the external debt burden of Africa  whose conditions and modalities will have to be decided on in the context of an international conference. The struggle against drought  desertification and acid rain continues to mobilize us within the African regional context - in the Inter-state Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel  the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development and the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference - so as to ensure food self-sufficiency in a manner in which the balance of the ecosystem will be respected and restored. On the occasion of the fourteenth anniversary of the Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel  in his message of 11 September 1987  President Abdou Diouf  in his capacity as Chairman of that Organization  after expressing once again his thanks to the international community  solemnly stated that despite the perils of drought and desertification  the States members of the Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel were resolved to win what he called ""the war against hunger and desertification"".The Head of state of Senegal  in speaking about the long-term prospects for action against hunger and accepting the Hunger Project ""Africa Leadership"" prize here in New York on 17 September 1987  appealed to the international community to stand side by side with the African States in a world front for economic peace in Africa.The objective of such a front is to continue and increase action now under way to deal with the critical situation and nutritional needs and  above all  to establish an integrated strategy for carrying out lasting and definitive solutions to the problem of hunger. The initial responses to that appeal strengthen our conviction that this Assembly  which has already dealt with the concept of countries stricken by desertification  will indeed offer the support which this initiative deserves.As important as economic recovery is  there is another aspect of building a world of progress  justice and peace  namely  the protection of human rights and the rights of peoples. Senegal  Whose Government  has placed the individual at the very centre of its policy and its day-to-day preoccupations  continues to be involved in the exalted work of the international promotion of human rights Human rights are an indivisible and interdependent whole. The same importance must be devoted to promoting and protecting all the rights of man - civil and political rights; economic  social and cultural rights; individual rights or collective rights; the rights of the first generation  of the second generation  and even the third.International co-operation thus has open to it a vast field in which to seek the necessary conditions to achieve human rights through an approach that embraces the social  economic and cultural heritages of peoples. This must necessarily involve a regional approach  as it is true that such action will also strengthen international co-operation in the area. Against this background  we are happy to welcome the entry into force  on 21 October 1986  of the African charter of the rights of the individual and of peoples  which indeed holds great promise. It is the decisive contribution of our Mother Africa to the universal endeavour of protecting and promoting human rights. We are also pleased that its monitoring group  the African commission on the rights of the individual and of peoples  has now been established with the election of its 11 members on 29 July 1987  and we trust that its work will indeed live up to the hopes of all those who hold justice dear.While we welcome these measures taken by the Organization of African Unity to ensure true respect for human rights in Africa  we must recognize that much remains to be done  particularly in the southern-most part of the continent  specifically in South Africa  where the apartheid regime  that crime against mankind  continues to run rampant. That system of racism and institutionalised racial discrimination  with its permanent state of emergency  arbitrary detention  unjust sentences and arbitrary executions constitutes a serious challenge and threat to the authority and credibility of the United Nations. It is the most widespread and flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.Illegally occupying the international territory of Namibia  the Pretoria regime continues to carry on with impunity its acts of aggression  destabilization and invasion against neighbouring African countries  thereby negating the principles and norms of modern international law.In the face of such a situation  it is difficult to conceive of any peaceful solution apart from pressure on the Botha regime. It is difficult to conceive of measures other than the imposition of comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa  to try to provide the conditions necessary to ensure the initiation of honest negotiations  carried out in good faith  between the Pretoria authorities and the legitimate representatives of the liberation movements and patriotic forces of South Africa with a view to establishing a system based on equality  democracy and fraternity..There was a glimmer of hope at the meeting held at Dakar from 9 to 12 July 1987 between representatives of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and a group of white Afrikaners from South Africa who initiated a new approach designed to avoid any conflict situation that could become tragic in its dimensions. That new process of evolution towards a non-racial  democratic and egalitarian society does indeed inspire some hope of dispelling misunderstanding and fear.Those who participated in the meeting at Dakar — people of all races  all political persuasions  all social positions - unanimously recognized that the establishment of a non-racial democracy in South Africa was both urgent and The recent international conference on children  repression and the law under the apartheid regime  which met at Harare only a few days ago and brought together representatives of the ANC  domestic anti-apartheid movements and representatives of more than 30 countries  and the first meeting of 8ou national delegates of South African white groups against apartheid within the context of a conference entitled ""Towards Democracy"" were carried out in the same spirit as the Dakar meeting and extended its scope.The advent of democracy in the southern part of our continent is indeed a real challenge to the United Nations. To take up this challenge  which is a blot on the millennium that is drawing to a close  the United Nations - which  in 1985  in a coming together of mind and heart  celebrated the fortieth anniversary of its Charter and  in 1986  commemorated the International Year of Peace and the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the International Covenants on Human Rights - must once again show that it is capable of mobilizing support for just causes that are in keeping with its purposes  principles and objectives.By virtue of the powers vested in it under its historic responsibilities  the Security Council must take the necessary measures under Chapter VII of the Charter to dismantle as soon as possible the abominable system of apartheid  which is the source of all the evils from which the southern part of Africa is suffering.Achieving peace also depends on improvement of the world situation as regards the maintenance of international peace and security. We can indeed be happy at the agreement  in principle  entered into by the United States and the Soviet Union on eliminating medium-range missiles from Europe. This is a contribution to 3isarmament  to security and to peace among the nations. We would express the hope that this process  now begun  will continue and that it will be extended to other kinds of weapons  to other countries and to other regions; that it will lead to general and complete disarmament and to the strengthening of peace and international security; and that it will help to make available additional financial resources for aid to development.On the question of the conflict between Chad and Libya and the question of Western Sahara  my country welcomes the promising initiatives that have been taken at the African level by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and its ad hoc committee and also at the level of the United Nations by the Secretary-General and the current chairman of the OAU. We hope that such initiatives will yield positive results.But  despite these few encouraging signs  the international political situation over the last year is still marked by the persistence of traditional hotbeds of tension and the intensification of blind violence in many cases.The conflict in the Middle East  because of its complexity and the seriousness of the implications  is one of the most painful problems facing the International community and one for which a final solution must be found. Yet it is not recommendations or resolutions providing the framework for settlement of the conflict that are lacking. There is even a broad consensus in favour of a just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East based on the implementation of a global and balanced approach  taking duly into account the interests of all parties involved. This is a consensus  which today is supported by unanimity  on the recommendation of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East. As the appropriate framework for a search for a just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East  the conference should be held as soon as possible under the auspices of the United Nations and with the full participation of all parties involved or interested  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people	The question of knowing what role such a negotiating forum should play and who the actors will be should not  in the view of Senegal  continue to block the efforts of the international community to convene it  if the political will to move ahead is indeed present in everybody. The Security Council must resolutely proceed with the preparatory phase of the international peace conference. The tireless efforts of the Secretary-General made throughout this year confirm that this is the only right path in the present circumstances that can lead to the restoring of trust and a dialogue  both of which are essential to a return to harmony and peace in a region that has given so much to civilization.Now can we fail to express once again our concern over the interminable war between Iran and Iraq. Recent developments in the conflict do indeed strengthen our belief that the United Nations  through the Security Council in particular  should bring its full authority to bear to limit the threat of a general outbreak and to bring about a cessation of the fighting and lead the two parties to have recourse to the means of peaceful settlement of their dispute. Some months ago information was made available about an imminent complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan  but this has not yet been confirmed in fact. On the contrary  the military situation in that country has worsened and the political situation seems to be deadlocked judging by the state of the negotiations in Geneva. It is high time for the resolutions adopted by this Organization during the last eight years to be taken into consideration so that the people of Afghanistan may finally exercise their right freely to determine their own future.	 This aspiration to self-determination also inspires the people of Kampuchea  who are still living under foreign occupation despite the constantly renewed efforts of our Organization to bring back peace to that part of the world.Under the far-sighted leadership of the President of the International Conference on Kampuchea  Mr. Leopold Gratz  the Ad Hoc Committee established by that Conference  over which my country has the honour of presiding  continues to seek ways and means of removing the obstacles to the application of the principles that were defined in July 1981 for a just  lasting and definitive settlement of all aspects of the problem of Kampuchea.Senegal  for its part  reaffirms its support for the eight-point proposal of the provisional coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and will continue to spare no effort to help the people of Kampuchea to regain its dignity. It is  more specifically  a Question of the withdrawal of the foreign troops to enable the Kampuchean people to exercise in all freedom their right to self-determination  achieve reconciliation and buckle down to the tasks of reconstruction and development of a country devastated by war. In Central America  the political settlement of conflicts  both internal and external  should be accompanied by regional guarantees of security and non-interference  protection of human rights and the establishment of democracy  with absolute respect for the sovereignty of States  as recommended by the Contadora Group  the Lima Support Group and the Guatemala agreement. My country welcomes the agreement entered into by countries in the region and assure those friendly countries of our support for its implementation.The international community is faced with the phenomenon of international terrorism  which also constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. The struggle against international terrorism must be waged with courage and far-sightedness and in accordance with the principles set forth in the Charter of our Organization. Senegal will continue to spare no effort to make its contribution to the international community's efforts to put an end as quickly as possible to international terrorism.This year once again the credibility of this universal Organization has been sorely tested. The political  economic and financial problems facing the human race as a whole constitute real threats to international peace and security. Our people are wondering what the future will be and they fix their hopes on us and our work. We must respond to their questions and expectations by genuine co-operation and international solidarity. We have the means to do this for  as the President of the Republic of Senegal said here when he was Acting Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU):""Mankind has in the past given us too many examples of its ability to meet constant challenges for us to have any doubts that it will be able to overcome those that beset it today."" (A/40/PV.42  p. 15)Each and every one of us must show the political will necessary for our response to live up to the hopes placed in us. It is in that spirit that my country  whose candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council has been unanimously recommended and endorsed by the countries of our region and by the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)   and which will endeavour to merit the trust that Members would place in us by electing us; assures the Assembly that we will make the most positive contribution we can to ensuring the advent of a world of peace  progress and solidarity and the emergence of a planetary village where  in the shadow of the skyscrapers of Manhattan  taking the place of the baobab tree under which palavers take place  our dialogue will be able to solve all the problems facing the human race."
"124",6172,"SGP",42,1987,"﻿Please allow me to congratulate you  Sir  to your unanimous election. We are confident that  with your sensitive understanding of the complexities of the international situation and your considerable diplomatic experience  you will guide our deliberations fairly and wisely in the coming months. I should also like to welcome Ambassador Joseph Reed to the podium and congratulate him on his assumption of the post of Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. The Secretary-General could have found no better person for the job. Last  but not least  please allow me to place on record our appreciation of the good work done by your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury.This session of the Assembly is being held at a time when profound changes are under way in the basic structures and processes of international politics. A summit meeting between President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev will be held towards the end of the year. The two super-Powers are on the verge of concluding important arms control agreements. At the same time  relations between China and the Soviet Union now include an increasingly important co-operative dimension.These developments do not concern only the three great Powers directly Involved. When these Powers reorder their relationships  the ripples spread to the farthest corners of the International system. None of us can escape their consequences. We must all also adapt to these changes. Readjustment is never easy. Cherished habits of thought. Ingrained patterns of behaviour and comfortably familiar policies must be ruthlessly and dispassionately examined in the light of the new situation and  if necessary  discarded. Human nature being what it is  this is necessarily a painful process. But it has to be done.I was reminded of this simple fact by a recent statement made by an important international leader. At a meeting of disarmament experts organized by the United Nations  held in June this year  he said:""... we had to review analytically the traditional approaches to  and established notions about  peace and security. In other words  we had to apply new thinking to that major issue of our times. In the process of sorting out. outdated dogmas and stereotypes  we made at least two fundamental conclusions. First  in terms of the supreme interests of survival  the world is one  notwithstanding its diversity. .. Second  the security of any State would be greater If It abandoned the attempts to diminish the security of the other side.""I wish to emphasize that last sentence. That statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union  Alexander Bessmertnykh. If a super-Power recognizes the need for change  no other country should deceive itself with the illusion that it can keep to the well-trodden path. History is littered with the rubble of States that tried to do so.  The United Nations is itself the consequence of a similar period of international readjustment that occurred after the Second World War. It was intended to reorder the manner in which the international system worked and the way in which States dealt with each other. If its purposes and promise have not been entirely fulfilled we should nevertheless ask ourselves what role the United Nations can play in helping the vast majority of its Members adapt to the profound transformations that are now under way. We  the small States of the third world make up that majority. I believe that the United Nations has an important role to play. To dismiss it as irrelevant is easy  cheap  cynical and a serious mistake. Few  if any  of us present here are privy to the private discussions of the great Powers. Few  if any  of us have the ability to influence directly the recalculations of national interests that are occurring as the great Powers slowly but inexorably reorder their relationships. Only in the United Nations can we meet as formal equals. The United Nations  for all its obvious imperfections  is still the only 0rganization that has at least the potential to protect the rights and interests of small States. Great Powers may be able to do without international institutions  but to Namibians and Palestinians fighting for their homelands  to the South Africans battling against the evil system of apartheid and to all oppressed peoples struggling against foreign invasion and occupation only the United Nations offers some hope that their interests will not be cast into oblivion as the great Powers reposition themselves. The United Nations is thus uniquely situated to help the smaller States adapt to changing patterns of international politics. Only in the United Nations are ourinterests protected·  and only the United Nations can define issues in a manner that helps to ease the painful process of readjustment. It does so because when the international community speaks through the adoption of United Nations resolutions by overwhelming majorities no State  even if it does not wholly support a particular resolution  should feel threatened. Every State  whatever its particular interest  is also part of that same international community. The United Nations compels States  even against their will  to recognize what is ultimately in their own best interest. It would be a mistake to regard the United Nations merely as a reflection of national interests. The United Nations speaks for all  and in upholding universal principles of law and justice the United Nations transcends the national and specific by speaking also to that irreducible core of common interests that bind us together  whatever else may divide us.It is an axiom that States act in their own interest  but the United Nations acts in the interest of all. No State  however intransigent  however indifferent  therefore  can indefinitely ignore the United Nations. A case in point is an issue of vital importance to my country's region: the issue of Kampuchea. As a study of how the United Nations has influenced the definition of Member States' interests  Kampuchea is an issue of more than parochial significance.When the United Nations Security Council first met to discuss the invasion and occupation of Kampuchea  in January 1979  Viet Nam at first denied that it had sent any of its forces into Kampuchea. Later it claimed that it had only sent in volunteers. Finally  under pressure from the United Nations  Viet Nam admitted that it had sent its armed forces into Kampuchea  but it insisted that they had entered at the invitation of the regime it had installed in Phnom Penh after the invasion  which was really an attempt to suggest that the cart had pulled the horse into Kampuchea. United Nations pressure has also changed Viet Nam’s position on the crucial issue of whether a political settlement is necessary in Kampuchea. On 5 January 1980 the Vietnamese Foreign Minister and some of his Indo-Chinese colleagues signed a communiqué which dealt with Kampuchea. He said/ ""The situation in Kampuchea is irreversible."" He also affirmed that efforts to ""find a political solution for Kampuchea were in vain and useless"". Six and a half years later after successive General Assembly resolutions had enjoined his country to agree to a political solution  the Vietnamese Foreign Minister  at a similar meeting  signed a communiqué acknowledging that he had to work with other countries ""to reach a political solution on the Kampuchean question"". The move from a denial that a problem even exists to an admission that there is a problem that can be solved only by political means is a very significant first step.The United Nations can take credit for this Important first step; but it Is only a first step. For Viet Nam to take the next step of actually commencing negotiations to find a political solution  the United Nations must persuade Viet Nam by continuing to take a firm position on the issue. For a political solution to be durable  it must be just. It must address the common concerns of the parties involved and not merely be a covet under which to impose one State's will over another by duplicitous means.This simple truth was stated with clarity and brevity by Mr. Gorbachev when heSaid: ""The ultimate wisdom lies in not thinking solely of oneself or  worse still  to the detriment of the other side. All must feel that they have the same degree of security."" We hope that Mr. Gorbachev's friends and allies will share his insight and take his advice. In formulating proposals that embody this principle  the United Nations also has a vital role to play. The resolutions of the General Assembly on the situation in Kampuchea that have been adopted  time and again  by overwhelming majorities sketch out the framework for such a solution. They take into consideration the Interests of all the parties concerned  not least of which are Viet Nam's interests. And because they reflect the voice of the international community  United Nations resolutions should not be regarded as a victory for one State or one party over another but rather as a triumph of our common humanity. There should be no dishonour or disadvantage in complying with United Nations resolutions.One recent proposal which is fully in accordance with the United Nations spirit is that made by my Indonesian colleague  Professor Kusumaatmadja  who has proposed that an informal meeting of all the Kampuchean parties be convened. Such a meeting would take into account the fact that the Kampuchean problem also has to be resolved between the different Khmer factions  a point that Viet Nam has maintained ever since the Kampuchean issue was first considered by the United Nations Security Council in January 1979. But it is obvious that Viet Nam  as the State whose military forces and civilian administrators are in occupation of Kampuchea  holds in its hands the unique ability to determine whether such a meeting among the Khmers would be meaningful or a mere charade. Professor Kusumaatmadja's proposal therefore envisaged that Viet Nam would respond to our consideration in good faith of its interests by participating in the meeting of the Khmers  though not necessarily in the initial stages. Unfortunately  Viet Nam has refused to acknowledge that it holds the key to the solution of the Kampuchean problem and has not agreed to participate in such talks. Instead Viet Nam has tried to distort the nature of the understanding that was reached  it has loudly claimed that some kind of agreement was reached between the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Indo-Chinese States and that the international community could best help by refusing to take a position that would support one side or the other. The bald and simple fact is that Viet Nam has not agreed to participate in any discussion that will lead to the withdrawal of its military forces from Kampuchea and enable Kampuchea to re-emerge as a free and independent nation. It would be a tragedy for the Kampucheans  for the South-East Asians and for the international community if the United Nations did not continue to take a clear and principled stand on the issue. It was the pressure of the United Nations that forced Viet Nam to accept the fact that a Kampuchean problem existed and that it required a political solution. It will also be the continued pressure from the International community that will force Viet Nam to accept a solution based on the principles of the United Nations Charter The efforts of the international community and the efforts of the South-East Asian States to find a solution are mutually complementary and not mutually exclusive. The ASEAN States will continue with their good faith efforts to find a solution. We will stay in close touch with Prince Norodom Sihanouk  who has sent a valuable political signal to Viet Nam by deciding to take leave for a year to make himself available for discussion with any party in order to move towards a solution of the Kampuchean problem. Prince Norodom Sihanouk remains the only Kampuchean leader who is widely respected both inside and outside Kampuchea. No viable solution can be found without Prince Norodom Sihanouk's participation. The international community should urge the Vietnamese leaders to talk direct to Prince Norodom Sihanouk. .History has demonstrated that all attempts to deny international change must ultimately be futile. Reality has an inconvenient habit of imposing itself even on the most ostrich-like. As the major Powers make the recalculations that will shape the international politics of the next century  our participation in the United Nations helps to ensure that we adapt to the new situation without too long a delay and without too much pain. But even as we acknowledge the necessity of adaptation  we must not lose sight of certain constant and fixed points of reference. The United Nations Charter embodies such points of reference and contains the basic moral principles that it is our duty to cleave to even as we adapt to survive. Herein lies the uniqueness of the United Nations; it is a vehicle for steadfastness as well as a vehicle for change; a means of ensuring that the necessary and inevitable adaptations will be purposeful rather than random or cynical. It is for this reason that  despite the inevitability of disappointments along the way  I continue to believe that with the perseverance and dedication of this body  just solutions to the Questions of Kampuchea  the Middle East  South Africa  and the many other troubled regions of the world are still possible. The United Nations is a sophisticated instrument that enables its Members to navigate safely the treacherous shoals of international politics to reach the safe harbour of international order. It remains the duty of us  its Members  to find the will to use the United Nations."

I share this trust with them. And so  Sir  may I offer you my congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. In my humble opinion  there is no question that your professional abilities and outstanding personal qualities will ensure the success of the work of this session and that it will yield the benefits that we may all expect from it. To that end  I assure you of the support and co-operation of my delegation.Let me also place on record Solomon Islands' deep appreciation of your predecessor  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  who presided over the last session in such an able and effective manner.To our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  I reaffirm the gratitude of my Government and people for his dedication to the principles of our Organization and for his tireless efforts as well as his leadership in advancing the noble goals of international peace and security.I must at the outset take the opportunity to thank all Member States for the unanimous support which was given to resolution 41/193  on special economic assistance to Solomon Islands following cyclone Namu  which hit our islands in May 1986. My Government and people  whose warm and friendly greetings I bring to everyone here  are very grateful to each and every member. In particular  I wish to thank the co-sponsors of that resolution; Australia  Fiji  Japan  New Zealand  Papua New Guinea  Samoa  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  the United States of America and Vanuatu. Our deep gratitude goes also to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the good work it has been doing in our rehabilitation programme. We feel that UNDP's continuing role and assistance are crucial to the success of this programme.The year 1987 has been designated as the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. It is also the year during which the world's population will exceed the 5 billion mark. By the end of this century there is likely to be an additional billion people. The drastic reduction in death rates owing to advancements in medical science and technology  is something to be pleased about; but it is also a great cause for concern  because millions of people still live without the basic necessities of life - food  shelter and good clean water.Peace  we all agree  is not just the absence of war: it is the global ambience of harmony in the interrelationships of States. Peace is the kind of condition that will pave the way for improving living standards in developing countries  thereby ensuring that the world's five-billionth citizen will start the day with the most basic social services at hand. Looking back at 1986 as the International Year of Peace  have we come any closer to a full realization of this important principle of the Charter? With the passing of 1987  are we likely to see a glimpse of hope for the homeless  not only in our own countries or regions but globally as well?Solomon Islands is fully convinced that this glimpse of hope does not rest only on the effectiveness of modern technology or on improved agricultural productivity  important though these have been and will continue to be. Rather  the improvement of conditions for the poor and homeless rests squarely on global peace in its totality - and this includes the freedom of all peoples from the forces that hinder their self-determination and independence.It is more than eight years now since the Vietnamese forces invaded and occupied Kampuchea. This act has not only caused much suffering to the Kampuchean people  but has been  and continues to be  a destabilizing factor in the South-East Asian region. Indeed it remains a threat to international peace and security. Solomon Islands continues to condemn Viet Nam for its invasion and occupation of Kampuchea. In our view  the Kampuchean problem can be settled only with the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces. In this respect  my Government strongly feels that the Eight-Point Proposal put forward by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea on 17 March 1986 is the best starting-point for a negotiated settlement which should set the scene for the restoration of peace  security and stability in the region  and the survival of democratic institutions in the country.The situation in Afghanistan still remains another cause for concern. Here a popular resistance movement has been consistently suppressed by a super-Power. With more than 100 00Ü Soviet troops still in Afghanistan  we just cannot see how Afghan citizens can live normal lives  let alone determine their own destiny. Again  we earnestly urge the Soviet Union to heed the repeated calls of the international community to withdraw all its forces from Afghanistan and thereby give the Afghans a chance freely to choose their own system of government.How long is the international community going to allow the racist regime of South Africa to haunt its conscience? How long are we going to sit by and watch our fellow human beings suffer under a regime that has not the slightest respect for human dignity? Have we not all agreed that apartheid is a mockery of justice and civilized behaviour and must therefore be eliminated? Yes  we have. It must be wiped out with a concerted action.In the case of Namibia  we do not accept South Africa's insistence on linking an extraneous issue to the implementation of the United Nations plan for the peaceful transition to independence of the Territory. Both the Security Council and the General Assembly have categorically rejected this linkage as contravening the terms of Security Council resolution 435 (197B)  which must remain the sole basis for resolving the Namibian problem.Since Pretoria has been turning a deaf ear to the call for the elimination of apartheid  we strongly feel the international community must move to apply comprehensive mandatory sanctions - a measure which is in keeping with the letter and spirit of Chapter VII of the Charter. If the litany of our exhortations is not going to bring Pretoria to any new enlightenment  then let us allow our actions henceforth to dismantle that evil system.Peace in the Middle East is one of the oldest and most contentious issues with which the United Nations has grappled. Solomon Islands supports the fundamental and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including their right to their own State. At the same time  we fully support the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized borders. We believe that it is only through the good will of all parties concerned to negotiate that a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the dispute can be reached. A United Nations sponsored international conference on the Middle Last would offer much to this end.Last month marked the eighth year of the Iran-Iraq war - a war which has now outlasted both the First and Second World Wars in its duration. Recent events have shown that a dangerous growth of tensions is also taking place in the Persian Gulf. Certainly  there is a pressing need to adopt urgent and effective measures which would promote a radical scaling down of tensions in the Gulf and the speediest ending of the Iran-Iraq war. My Government is firmly convinced that Security Council resolution 598 (19Ö7) of 20 July 1987 provides the best framework for promoting peace  and we therefore urge both parties to comply with its terms in response to the clear call of the global community to end the war.In Central America  Solomon Islands hopes that the recent regional efforts will soon yield a peaceful solution. In this context we welcome the efforts of tile Contadora Group and others to attain peace and democracy in the region.With regard to the situation on the Korean peninsula  Solomon Islands continues to support the principle of the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas and that this be pursued without outside interference. It is therefore imperative that the dialogue between the two should be reopened at the earliest possible date without pre-conditions. Should South Korea and North Korea consider joining the United Nations as a step towards their reunification  Solomon Islands would welcome and support their individual membership. This would contribute to relaxing tensions while at the same time enhancing the principle of the universality of the membership of the United Nations. Since both countries are already members of a number of United Nations specialized agencies  we believe it would be in order for the Organization to admit them as Members. International terrorism is worse now than it ever has been. As in previous years  my delegation joins the universal condemnation of international terrorism and pledges to do whatever is possible within our limited means to eliminate it in all its forms and manifestations. The same must be said about drug abuse and its illegal trafficking. My Government is firmly committed to dealing severely with those who may try to introduce these practices to our islands and people. As a young democratic nation  Solomon Islands subscribes to the protection of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms. These are clearly enshrined in our national Constitution. I mention this to highlight our genuine concern over the violation of these principles in a number of countries around the globe.Turning now to the South Pacific region  I wish to congratulate the Assembly on its historic achievement of 2 December 1986  when it adopted resolution 41/41 A  relating to the question of New Caledonia. The debate on that resolution was most significant  because  for the first time in the history of this Organization  much attention was focused for one and a half days on the South Pacific region. To us in Solomon Islands  that event brought the United Nations closer to our region  and vice versa.This is as it should be  for the South Pacific island States which are Members of the United Nations cannot continue to be passive recipients of decisions from here. We have to be active participants in the decision-making process of the Organization  because this is the only insurance we have against new outside forces and influences. I was therefore heartened to note that in late June and early July of this year Solomon Islands was included in the itinerary of the United Nations Visiting Mission looking at the performance of United Nations agencies in our region.We certainly welcomed the Mission  which was led by the Permanent Representative of New Zealand  and we made our views amply clear to it. Our aim is to make United Nations agencies operating in Solomon Islands efficient and cost-effective. We will do our best to attain that objective and we expect the United Nations and its agencies to be equally responsive to our particular needs.There is a growing school of thought which predicts that the Pacific Ocean is the ocean of the future. This proposition is both attractive and appealing to those of us living in that region. In my view  such a forecast is probably based on scientifically researched and proved criteria? Therefore any move to tap the resources of the region must not be left to blind chance or only to those with advanced technology. Pacific island nations must be part of the development challenge. Our regional development as well as the progress of our individual nations  however  can proceed only on the basis of a stable environment. Without that  we are more likely to suffer the loss of our dignity and self-respect as a result of increasing interest in the region shown by outsiders.But the prospects for stable regional development are not good  because of such conditions as the potentially explosive situation in New Caledonia. This is why we ate deeply concerned by the stubbornness of Prance regarding the decolonization process of that Territory. This is why we have been urging the Administering Authority to co-operate with us within the framework of the established principles and practices of the United Nations.I should like to restate here the basic position of Solomon Islands on New Caledonia. New Caledonia is a Non-Self-Governing Territory; therefore France  as the Administering Authority  is obliged to do everything possible to bring it to self-determination and independence. Solomon Islands fully supports independence for New Caledonia and it is our desire to see this objective achieved peacefully  without further bloodshed.It is our firm position that the United Nations  through its appropriate organ  must be actively involved in the decolonization process in New Caledonia. This is the only basis on which a legitimate act of self-determination should be pursued. Without such appropriate United Nations involvement  any determination by the French authorities as to the choice of the people of New Caledonia for the future status of that Territory must not be accepted as a choice which has been made through the normal democratic process of free and fair elections. The role that the Kanaks - the indigenous people of New Caledonia - must have in deciding the future of their homeland is vital to the question of independence. Of all the different ethnic groups in New Caledonia  the Kanaks make up the largest single group. Their position  as represented by the FLNKS (Front de libération nationale Kanak socialiste)   which commands the majority support of the Kanaks  is clear; they want to exercise their right to self-determination and independence and they wish to do so with United Nations involvement in accordance with the established principles and practices of the Charter.It is  therefore  a matter of regret that France has gone ahead with a mock referendum in total disregard of the views of the majority of the States Members of the Organization. In the circumstances  Solomon Islands does not recognize the results of that plebiscite as a genuine indication of the wish of the people of New Caledonia. Without independent observers of the referendum  those results must remain questionable in the eyes of the international community. My Government can only accept a United Nations sponsored referendum on the question of New Caledonia's independence.I now wish to clarify the position of my Government on the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. While the South Pacific Forum has accepted the Federated States of Micronesia and Marshall Islands as full members of the Forum  Solomon Islands does not as yet recognize them as fully independent States. The criteria for membership of the Forum are different from those governing membership of the United Nations  We consider that while the Federated States of Micronesia and Marshall Islands have both conducted genuine acts of self-determination under United Nations auspices  we still believe that until the trusteeship has been terminated by a decision of the Security Council  that trusteeship remains in force  Solomon Islands none the less respects the constitutional steps taken so at by the United States as the Administering Authority  in fulfilling its Charter obligations with respect to three of the countries of the Trust Territory of the pacific Islands.The quest for peace is the concern of this Organization. Year in  year out  .n this very Hall we hear statements from this rostrum calling on us all to give peace a chance. Have we done so? In our desire for peace and a world free of nuclear weapons  Solomon Islands  in May of this year  became the eleventh signatory to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty - a Treaty to which some Powers readily acceded  while others disregarded it  but which the nations of the Pacific regard as a symbol of their contribution to peace and the safety of mankind.  My Government is  therefore  deeply grateful to the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for signing Protocols 2 and 3 of that Treaty.At the same time  we must express our disappointment that while the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland had indicated their willingness to abide informally by the provisions of the Treaty and its Protocols  they nevertheless refrained from signing them. We again call on those two Powers and on Prance to reconsider their positions with a view to signing Protocols 2 and 3 of that Treaty.On the question of nuclear testing in our region France must again face international condemnation. Since Solomon Islands became a Member of this 0rgani2ation it has consistently and categorically condemned French nuclear testing on Mururoa Atoll. There is no need to elaborate on the danger of nuclear pollution. The memory of the Chernobyl disaster is still fresh in everyone's mind. It is one of those alarming events that have shocked people everywhere. Foe the people of Solomon Islands  the ocean surrounding us is our source of life. Our seas  reefs and lagoons have been and always will be our source of livelihood. Now we are worried because they are in danger of nuclear contamination.Solomon Islands is totally opposed to nuclear testing and the use of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific region. Despite the repeated protests of all States members of the South Pacific Forum regarding such tests  the Government of Prance defiantly continues its testing programme at Mururoa. We are not convinced at all by those who say these tests are safe  because if they are  why not conduct them on the farmlands of France?My country is a nation of islands with a very narrow economic base. Our major exports are fish  palm oil and copra. Our efforts to step up production in these areas have always been hampered by natural disasters  particularly cyclones  which have  in the recent past  become so frequent in our region that they are almost part of our daily life. The resources of fisheries are very important to our economy. For that reason we subscribe strongly to the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We believe the Convention provides the necessary safeguards for our fisheries and other marine resources.In the exploitation of such resources  our basic objective is to gain the maximum benefit for our people  and a fair return to those who may wish to invest in these resources. For that reason  my Government welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations on the multilateral fisheries treaty between the United States of America and the countries of the South Pacific Forum.Despite recent events in the region  the South Pacific has been a reasonably peaceful place when compared with other parts of the world. But now  with super-Power rivalry gaining momentum  our future stability is uncertain. A small country like ours does not wish to be drawn into any super-Power confrontation. We are more interested in bettering our living standards and I therefore urge those concerned to respect and help us sustain our efforts to build our nation  rather than confuse us with power play.I trust that the resolution of the various issues that gravely concern this body - freedom for the colonized and the oppressed  prevention of the nuclear annihilation of mankind  peace and security in the world  shelter for the homeless  food for the starving  and a better living standard for all - will move a step closer to fulfilment in the course of this session. Then we shall have come nearer to realizing the promise; ""Peace on earth  good will towards men""."
"126",6252,"SLE",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the Sierra Leone delegation I  should like  Sir to extend warm congratulations to you on your election to the presidency o£ the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your unanimous election to that high office is in recognition of your distinguished record as a statesman and your long experience in diplomacy· I wish to assure you of my delegation's fullest co-operation in the discharge of your awesome duties.May I also avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor for the admirable manner in which he conducted the deliberations of the forty-first session.	I take this opportunity to express my delegations appreciation to the Secretary-General for the lucid and comprehensive report he has presented on the work of the Organization since the last session  vie are deeply heartened that the Organization is gradually becoming the object of a ""greater commonality of views"" among its Members  scarcely a year after its very existence was in jeopardy.The renewed interest in multilateralism this development represents calls for deep reflection  since it entails complex processes at work  requiring skilled management on the part of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat. My Government is encouraged that the Secretary-General has risen sufficiently to this challenge by fearlessly pointing out flaws in the structure of the Organization and repudiating inappropriate conduct by Members  regardless of their size or influence.In this regard we note with approval the critical view he has cast on the current structure of the Economic and Social Council and the reforms he has proposed  especially the call to upgrade representation in that Council at the ministerial level  as well as the need to establish a small planning staff for development which could consider integrated approaches to development-related problems  taking account of the capacity of the system as a whole. The Secretary-General's efforts represent only one facet of what we require to ensure the viability and efficiency of our Organization. But firm commitment to the provisions of the Charter is the other  and perhaps the most crucial  element in ensuring our Organization's effectiveness. It is therefore a matter of great regret to us that Member States have often undermined the credibility of the United Nations for purely short-term political objectives  or sometimes through wilful neglect.The relevance of the United Nations as an instrument for the peaceful existence and orderly development of every nation no longer requires justification. Suffice it to say here that history is replete with instances of even weaker nations denying peace and orderly progress to greater nations in an unmanaged international environment. Thus it would be a serious mistake for any Member State to view its commitment to the United Nations as an altruistic gesture subject to its whims  rather than as a sacred duty dictated by an enlightened perception of its self-interest.Since the previous session  developments in the security  economic and social conditions in many parts of the world have given us more cause for despair than hope.As we observe the progress of negotiations towards the reaching of a historic agreement on disarmament between the super-Powers  our excitement is tempered by the knowledge that extensive testing of weapons capability is simultaneously taking place  and enormous resources are being devoted to the perfection of other means of mutual destruction. Therefore  as we acknowledge this remarkable disarmament effort between the super-Powers  we expect that the entire international community will perceive the true significance of this event as a major step in the urgent pursuit of more global and comprehensive arms control and disarmament agreements and as part of a greater security enterprise whose success also requires the peaceful resolution of regional and internal conflicts as well as the achievement of acceptable economic and social conditions in all nations.We believe that it would be naive for anyone to assume that islands of peace and security could be created and sustained in a world awash in tension and fed by racial prejudice  religious intolerance/ economic injustice and  above all  hegemonistic aspirations. That is why we have been tireless in calling on all nations to be resolute and noncompromising in demanding majority rule in South Africa and self-determination in Namibia. We have also constantly advocated that equal resolution be applied in the search for just settlements of the disputes in the Middle East  Kampuchea  Central America  Afghanistan  the Western Sahara and Chad.The Secretary-General has warned that a human tragedy of overwhelming proportions is imminent in South Africa unless  of course  timely action is taken to prevent it. The delegation of Sierra Leone has had occasion in this Assembly and elsewhere to offer its views on the kind of actions it considers appropriate for the international community to adopt to stave off this impending tragedy. We have no wish whatsoever to repeat those views here except  of course  to remind those who continue to oppose the imposition of comprehensive sanctions against the racist South African regime that they are endangering the very interests that they seek to protect by undermining the only viable instrument of gentle pressure against South Africa and making the violent destruction of that regime inevitable.In the absence of the apartheid regime’s readiness to negotiate a democratic and peaceful transition to majority rule in South Africa  and because of the reliance by that regime on the use of naked force against the majority black population to perpetuate its illegal existence  it becomes absolutely absurd for anyone to claim to be on the side of freedom and justice in South Africa and at the same time to repudiate the use of effective pressure against South Africa either in the form of sanctions or in the threat or use of military coercion.While we detest  as a matter of principle  the use of force for the achievement of political objectives as much as any other State Member of this Organization  we would not hide behind that principle to camouflage the abandonment of our sacred duty under the Charter to help eliminate from the face of the earth the barbarism  immorality and conflict all of which apartheid so visibly embodies.Very few of us need reminding that any system such as apartheid  which continues to subsist on a daily diet of imprisonment  torture and murder of black children as young as seven years of age  the indiscriminate massacre of dispossessed  defenceless and innocent members of its community  as well as citizens of neighbouring States  offers very few options for redress. This becomes a classic case of what the late President Kennedy referred to  with characteristic eloquence and perceptiveness  when he said: ""Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable."" That is the assessment of the situation in South Africa which those who directly carry its burden have now reached  as expressed by the African National Congress (ANC) leader  Mr. Oliver Tambo  who said;""Nobody should demand of us that we seek change by non-violent means when we are denied all constitutional possibilities to redress the grievances of the majority""We believe that the international community has the chance to avert the human tragedy in South Africa if it heeds the advice of the Secretary-General and takes timely action  for if by neglect or by cynicism we allow the tragedy to occur  the consequences may turn out not to be as bearable to some of us as we might have assumed.There is ample evidence that apartheid is crumbling. Both the spiritual and the intellectual underpinnings of apartheid suffered severe assault recently when the White Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa  the body that formulated the theological justification for that system  declared that scriptural rationales for enforced racial separation were an error that should now be rejected. Also recently  the University of Stellenbosch  the erstwhile intellectual powerhouse of apartheid  became a centre of opposition to that system.Let us realize that these events did not occur by accident or in a vacuum  but as a result of the intense and consistent political  economic and military pressures which the international community has exerted on South Africa in recent years.It is therefore logical that we keep up the pressures that brought these changes about  not only to achieve the eventual dismantling of apartheid but also to accelerate the process for the independence of Namibia. In this context we recognize and commend  among other things  the efforts that have brought about massive disinvestments in South Africa  the activities of trade unions and church organizations  in and outside of South Africa  the resolution of the freedom fighters  as well as the fortitude of the front-line States in southern Africa.The war between Iran and Iraq represents a tragedy of enormous proportions which the international community should do everything to end. The role of the United Nations in the pursuit of this objective is crucial  and we endorse the long-standing preoccupation of the Secretary-General with efforts to find a lasting solution to the conflict  culminating in his recent visit to Iran and Iraq.We believe that Member States of this Organization can  in their individual capacities  make significant contributions to the peace process by helping to create the general climate of trust and urgency without which the current cloud of suspicion which pervades the atmosphere cannot be dissipated  and without which there will be a prolongation of hostilities. We note with interest and satisfaction the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and appeal to the Secretary-General and all Members of this Organization to help create the conditions suitable for the implementation of that resolution.The revival of the idea of an international peace conference on the Middle East  and the current wide international support which that idea enjoys  is of great interest to my delegation. We have followed closely the progress of the Secretary-General's efforts to mobilize a consensus on the procedural aspects of the conference among the parties concerned  and we observe with deep disappointment that it has not yet been possible to obtain the agreement of some of the parties to the idea of convening an international conference.Our confidence in the resilience of the Secretary-General and in the goodwill of Members of this Organization encourages us  however  to hope that the existing obstacles will be overcome before long. At the same time we expect that the enormous suffering which the Palestinian people endure because of Israel's brutal activities in the occupied territories will continue to incense the conscience of Members of this institution and elicit sufficient resistance to Israel's designs to perpetuate its occupation.We see a total absence of moral strength and logic in a policy which seeks to preserve the rights of one people to a homeland and security by assaulting the same rights and the security of another people. What we have noted  as a result of this policy  is greater suffering and insecurity in the region and a greater threat to the stability of the international system as a whole. It is therefore in the interest of every member of the international community to work sincerely for the speedy resolution of the Middle East conflict; failure to do so would simply raise the cost for all and leave everyone much worse off.Many in this Hall will recall that not so many years ago Viet Nam was fighting to defend principles which it held dearly  and for which it received the sympathy and support of many nations. Today  however  it continues to deny the people of Kampuchea what Viet Nam itself claimed to have fought for so vigorously during those years. The paradox of yesterday's victim and tomorrow's oppressor always furnishes constant amazement.Last year  my delegation welcomed the eight-point peace plan put forward by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea to resolve the situation in that country. We expected the practical approach offered by that plan to secure a positive response from Viet Nam# if only as a measure of indicating the latter1 s peaceful intentions. At this stage we believe that Viet Nam has only two options: to demonstrate a genuine intention to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea and allow the people of that country to set up their own form of government  or to continue to prove unfaithful to its Charter obligations and to incense the international community. The Korean peninsula has remained an area of constant tension since the end of hostilities three decades ago. We believe that for the establishment of a durable peace in the region  both North and South Korea  whose membership of this Organization is a logical step  should implement proposals for the revival o£ high-level talks between them. Those talks should continue to be direct and devoid of extraneous issues which undermine trust and confidence.Recent developments in Central America  culminating in the signing of the Guatemala Agreement  the Arias Plan  have rightly aroused considerable optimism about the chances of durable peace in the region.We trust that all peace-loving nations will contribute sincerely towards the realization of our collective wish for the peace and prosperity of the Central American peoples.Although some progress towards a resolution of the Afghanistan situation seems to have occurred  notably the reported agreement on the monitoring of foreign troop withdrawal  the failure of the contending parties to agree on a date for the withdrawal of foreign troops continues to cause many delegations some anxiety.While not wishing to minimize the significance of the perceptible narrowing down of the difference in the various positions over the date for troop withdrawal achieved at the recent proximity talks in Geneva under the supervision of the special United Nations representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  we submit that so far there exists no cause for celebration; the danger that the Afghanistan situation poses to international peace and security remains as potent today as it has ever been. The continuing stalemate in Western Sahara is causing tremendous human suffering and economic devastation in the occupied territory  and countries in the region  particularly Algeria  are having to cope with huge refugee problems. The valuable assistance offered by the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in mitigating those refugee problems is highly commendable.While Sierra Leone continues to recognize the legitimate right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination  we appeal to all the parties concerned to co-operate with the Secretary-General in his effort to bring about the implementation of all relevant resolutions adopted by the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations  with specific regard to General Assembly resolution 40/50.The various reports on the status of the world economy are again unanimous this year in expressing pessimism about prospects for the economic well-being of the world  both in the short and medium terms. Each year  for over half a decade now  we have had to listen in this Assembly to gloomy forecasts for the world economy  and at the end of every session we have left here assuring ourselves that we have done enough to dispel the gloom after adopting resolutions and promising too.The progress we seem to achieve each time never proves to be adequate  as we not only continue to have the same set of problems but their magnitude has even tended to multiply. This has been happening particularly in the case of the development crisis  of which the debt problem is an integral part  under which most of the developing countries have been labouring for almost a decade now.The various manifestations of this crisis and its impact on the peoples of the developing world have for many years been a subject of extensive analyses and recommendations by academics  policy makers and development experts both in the United Nations and elsewhere.  The general climate of slow or negative growth that currently prevails in the affected countries is causing further deterioration in the commodities of life which have already reached record lows. Efforts to reverse this trend  especially in Africa  have encountered severe countervailing forces in the international environment  notably contracting capital flows  currency instability  falling commodity prices  rising protectionism and agricultural subsidies in industrial countries  and above all a crushing debt burden.For example  it has been established that borrowing countries now transfer huge net capital to creditor countries in the industrialized world: $107 billion from 1983 to 1986 and an estimated $27 billion in 1987 for the major borrowing countries alone; African countries have lost over $19 billion so far this year in falling commodity prices; the effect of the European agricultural subsidies is said to be equivalent to a 124 per cent tariff on wheat and a 226 per cent tariff on sugar; and the third world's total external debt increased from $729 billion in 1981 to over a trillion dollars this year.In the face of these paralysing obstacles  pleas for understanding to the rest of the international community often elicit paternalistic responses at best  and derision at worst. Where an offer of assistance has been given  it has often been conditional on the implementation of economic policies that paid little attention to structural differentiations in the developing countries.Thus the rigid enforcement of structural adjustment policies which always insist on import restriction and unregulated internal economic libetalÍ2ation - wholesale removal of subsidies  massive devaluations  auctioning off of public enterprises - has merely accelerated the decimation of the structural foundations of the target economies  spawning grotesque social and political problems in the process. It is most refreshing to note the recent signs of a rethink regarding structural adjustment policies in their original cast — ""structural adjustment with growth""  which is the new version embodying this evolution in thought  explicitly acknowledges  among other things  the necessity not only for greater external assistance to those developing countries undertaking adjustment but also for the protection of vulnerable groups in society during the adjustment process.Consolidation of the commitment by the industrialized countries which this development portends will definitely enhance the effectiveness of developing countries' efforts as they grapple with their economic problems.In this regard we note with deep appreciation the impressive actions already taken by the Secretary-General  international financial and development Institutions  as well as individual Governments and non-governmental organizations  to facilitate the successful implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery. However  we renew our call for a fresh approach to the debt problem which is currently of very urgent concern. Sierra Leone acknowledges the value of multi-year re-scheduling  longer maturities on new loans and capitalization of interest but  as we have already pointed out  total third-world obligations  instead of being reduced  have increased to a record level in 19Ö7 under these policies. What we need are policies that actually reduce the debt burden. Such policies would require the active intervention of Governments in creditor countries as well as international financial and development institutions.We have an enduring vision that because of its inherent dynamism the international system requires a new economic and political order that distributes  fairly  responsibilities and benefits to all nations  and not an order that can be artfully manipulated to ""benefit a few greatly  some not at all  and dramatically increase the cost for all."" "
"127",6298,"SLV",42,1987,"﻿I begin by warmly congratulating you  Mr. President  on the well-earned honour done to you in electing you to this lofty post at the forefront of the work of the General Assembly  which is now holding its forty-second session in a climate of great worldwide expectations prompted by the scale of the problems that are of concern to mankind and by the historical dynamics that particularly affect certain parts of the world where ideological  political and military confrontations have attained extremely dangerous  even dramatic  levels.Peace is the key to the concerns we all share. The most relevant example in that respect has been set by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose tireless devotion to the search for peaceful means of resolving truly difficult conflicts deserves our appreciation and respect. These are sentiments we express with admiration and gratitude.Peace is the key to our destiny as a species and as individual nations. Indeed  at this stage in history it is no longer possible to make clear-cut distinctions between mankind as a whole and each of its components  however geographically small they may be.For a long time  although this was not an ideal state of affairs  individuals and peoples were able to live aloof from one another  particularly with respect to more local problems and disputes. Today that is not possible. We cannot talk realistically now even about the East-West conflict or the North-South conflict. The world is so intimately interconnected that it is truer than ever before that "" to paraphrase John Donne - when the bell tolls  it tolls for all. However  when the bells  for some commendable reason  ring out in time  then we are entitled to share a legitimate feeling of pleasure.In Central America  after years in which the bells have been tolling for death  fear  injustice and the lack of understanding  we now hear  another sound  one which gives us the firm hope that  if the necessary efforts are made in the appropriate spirit  we shall attain that peace which would mean our survival as free nations. That is what our peoples have been clamouring for. It is what our Governments are endeavouring to attain  on the basis of their faith in authentic participatory  pluralistic and United democracy.On 7 August  the five Presidents of Central America  in an audacious  deliberate and Ear-sighted gesture  signed an agreement that  is historic not merely because of the extremely grave problems it tackles in a profound and effective fashion but also because it represents the first expression since independence was achieved in 1821 - when a similar feat was accomplished - of a United and indivisible commitment that undoubtedly constitutes the embryo of a new sense of Central Americanism. And it is not rhetorical but practical since it will  we hope  result in an indivisible consolidation of our economic  social  cultural and political future.The document to which we refer bears a title that reflects the spirit in which it was conceived - ""Procedures for establishing a firm and lasting peace in Central America"". The document  known as Esquipulas II  represents a programme for peace - a firm and lasting peace  a real peace. President Duarte  who played a decisive role in shaping the spirit and scope of this document  therefore insists on talking of peace  working for peace and holding dialogues about peace. The greatness of this joint achievement of the peoples and Governments of Central America derives from the fact that we have overcome warlike mentalities - which external ideological forces imposed upon us - and have emerged with a clear concept of peace that incorporates respect  security and mutual trust.We ate not  however  naive. We understand the enormous risks and snares that the eternal enemies of democracy are laying in our path  but we cannot wrap ourselves in obstructionist pessimism. We sincerely want peace  and we are struggling to achieve it  day by day  fulfilling the provisions of Esquipulas II and  within our country  adopting all those measures that would make possible the inclusion of irregular groups in democratic life. This would not breach the constitutional provisions the Salvadoran people have provided for themselves in full freedom and in a climate of sound political life that incorporates respect  guarantees and pluralism.Peace is at hand.In El Salvador  we have had to fight off treacherous  systematic and implacable aggression. At first  practically alone  we fought heroically against the territorial onslaughts that threatened  and indeed continue to threaten  our institutional life and the heritage of our people built up over many decades of persistent national endeavour. The world gradually came to recognize the essentially democratic nature of our struggle. Since 1980  we have travelled a hard path strewn with obstacles  and in doing so our people and its legitimate Government have created and strengthened a series of political  economic and social structures  enabling us to ensure that democracy has taken root deep in our soil.That is why subversion in El Salvador has lost its historical reason for being. On 1 June our Government completed an intensive exercise  and in his annual address President Duarte informed the nation of the final  definitive establishment of the institutional framework for consolidating the necessary climate of guarantees that makes possible the involvement of the insurgents in a social and legal framework that is just and truly democratic. That framework is made up of laws that strengthen the rule of law and due process and do not allow for excuses  rejection or challenge.There is no longer a state of emergency. There is a renewed framework of justice which  supplemented by the amnesty law soon to be enacted  meets all aspirations for freedom. Agricultural reform has already been established. There is reliable and secure electoral registration. Elections are scheduled for 1988 to buttress the system and  above all  the people and Government are determined faithfully to attain its objectives. For these reasons  and because of the certainty that it only through internal reform that we can meet the requirements of peace and democracy  we undertook to respect all the commitments of Esquipulas II. And for that reason  and in that sense  the insurgents must irrevocably accept the Esquipulas plan as well and return to democracy and civilian life once and for all.The people of El Salvador have been pioneers of freedom since 5 November 1811  when the first cry for emancipation was uttered in Central America in the city of San Salvador. At the same time  we have been pioneers of unity. In circumstances a thousand times more challenging  destiny has once again placed us in the vanguard of the defence of freedom. We accept that challenge with a sense of responsibility. We are meeting it at great cost but in the certainty that our endeavour will bear fruit not only for our own people but equally for other peoples of the area  to which we feel intimately linked.My Government has had to fight on many fronts - national and international. The tenacity and historic endeavours of the Government  under President Jose Napoleon Duarte  have been reflected in a series of measures and achievements ranging from the struggle for respect for human rights to full freedom of political expression for all the forces included in the peaceful legal process) from a vast programme of economic and social development to benefit society's poorer majority to the promotion of a new sense of citizenship that is demanding and vigilant but at the same time altruistic and imbued with a sense of solidarity from the progressive development of our democratic institutions to the orderly elimination of all remnants of the authoritarianism that had infiltrated various levels of the state and social systems of the country.Human rights and freedom of expression in their fullest sense have been of particular concern to President Duarte. The improvement and strengthening of all policies to safeguard human rights reflect a trend and a commitment in El Salvador  since we consider that enjoyment of and respect for human rights underpin democracy in El Salvador.This enormous endeavour  involving the entice people  sets us face to face with the most serious and urgent challenge of all - that of building peace  and doing so on the only possible scaffolding  that of democracy  because democracy is the key to peace. This is so clear and incontrovertible that it cannot be negotiated  belittled or distorted. Hence  that dialogue for peace called for by President Duarte for Sunday next  4 October  in the Apostolic Nunciature of San Salvador  with the insurgent groups  is a dialogue in accordance with Esquipulas II  a dialogue fervently desired by the Salvador an people and supported by all the free peoples of the world. It is a dialogue within the framework of an active  serious  solid and energetic democracy  one that can accommodate all trends of thought  even those of an extreme nature  provided that they respect the rule of law and the universal rules underlying any authentic process of social coexistence.The Government of El Salvador has put all its cards on the table. President Duarte  with the same conviction and with the same care with which  as one of its principal architects  he signed Esquipulas II  will talk with the insurgents  who have explicitly accepted the content and scope of that document. The present context of the dialogue with those groups is clear. They will talk about peace  not war. They will consolidate the democratic process  not destabilize it. That is the spirit and the letter of the document the Central American presidents signed with such hope and such realism. That is the purpose of President Duarte and his Government  and it is fully consistent with the wishes of all Salvador ans.Peace is at hand. Within that over-all perspective  and in order to ensure that the commitments set out in Esquipulas II become a reality  my country has  from the outset  sought to ensure that the problems in our region shall be approached in an over-all  simultaneous  multilateral  verifiable and universally accepted fashion.Such an approach must be comprehensive  because to achieve stable  effective agreements it is necessary to take into account not merely the complex roots of the conflict but also its present ramifications. What in the past might have been basically an internal matter has taken on international overtones  and it is impossible to continue to insist upon its original internal nature. The agreements must be simultaneous  for if the comprehensive approach of the document is to be effective  in the light  of the indivisible  global nature of the issues  the agreements must be carried out according to the schedule set by the signatory Governments or  in view of the nature of the measures to be adopted  at a basic  uniform tempo if no specific deadlines are set.The agreements must be multilateral because all the Central American Governments  without exception or pretext  are committed to finding solutions and to fostering commitments in a responsible and sincere spirit.They must be verifiable  because Esquipulas II is a historic agreement of mutual trust  adopted in good faith  setting in motion a process for dismantling in a peaceful and harmonious fashion all the structures and machinery of distrust  suspicion and aggression which the sickly spirit of war has unfortunately nurtured in our region.They must be universally acceptable because the Latin American spirit that inspired the document  enshrined in the Contadora process  and the clear and determined commitment of the five nations that are calling for autonomy and a shared destiny  imply that Esquipulas II must be respected and accepted as a unique and harmonious whole by the international community and  first and foremost  by Latin America. This implies  inter-alia  unqualified acceptance by all of the rejection of violence·  the discrediting and unacceptability of insurgent groups  which should rather have recourse to amnesty and disarmament' the acceptance of democracy as the sole path towards legitimate power in the region·  and other natural actions that must be adopted by some countries directly or indirectly involved in the peace plan.	.I should like to express my Government's appreciation for the words of support received from all the Governments of Latin America and the world  which we consider to have been made in the aforementioned spirit. We were recently saddened  nevertheless  to heat one dissident voice that seemed to go counter to our endeavours. I am referring to statements made by Cuba  which  in a broad series of comments  made discordant remarks that seemed to contradict its expressions of support for Esquipulas II  in particular with regard to efforts made by my Government to halt an armed conflict that no longer has any justification. Does Cuba support the clear and unobjectionable joint endeavours of the people and Government of El Salvador  who are obviously struggling for freedom and dignity in that country  out of respect for the humanistic and sacred principles of Bolivar  Marti and Juarez? Or is Cuba continuing its unconditional support - counter to the spirit and Letter of Esquipulas II - for the inhuman terrorists and insurgents still operating in El Salvador  who have brought so much bloodshed and grief to our long-suffering people through their reprehensible acts  their criminal laying of mines and their irrational destruction?We call upon Cuba to respect the sovereign will expressed in the peace agreement  to accept it unconditionally and openly  honestly and comprehensively. We call upon Cuba to stop the exporting of revolutions and to refrain from providing logistic and material support to the insurgents in El Salvador.Similarly  we consider that there must be an adequate international response to the call from the peoples of Central America to the international community to provide the resources that can truly safeguard a firm and lasting peace. Without such assistance and material support in overcoming the social crises that are undeniable components of our conflicts  it will not be possible to realize the ideal of a life of permanent freedom and democracy to which our societies aspire  We are realistic. We knew that the eradication of the underlying causes of the crisis can be achieved only through the elimination of marginalization and underdevelopment  for tomorrow  God willing  we may achieve peace; the followingday  however  a new and acute source of destabilization could arise – regional destabilization caused not by the lack of peace or freedom but rooted in the hunger and critical poverty currently afflicting our peoples.We therefore make a fervent appeal to the international community to assist us so that Esquipulas II can become a reality. That document places upon the signatory Governments the following obligations; in the climate of freedom guaranteed by democracy  the Central American countries shall adopt such agreements as will help to speed up development  in order to make their societies more egalitarian and free from misery.""The strengthening of democracy entails creating a system of economic and social well-being and justice. To achieve these goals  the Governments shall jointly seek special economic assistance from the international community."" (A/42/521  pp. 7-8) Peace is at hand.It was not by happenstance that Central America found itself in the explosive situation that we are today defusing  with the understanding of all the nations of the world. A full-scale plan of international subversion was set in motion to take advantage of our weaknesses  shortcomings and past errors  but that plan failed to take into account two essential factors that made possible the current positive developments in the crisis: The first is the determination of our peoples - who are simple  but endowed with exemplary stoicism and age-old wisdom - to enjoy the benefits and opportunities of freedom  without sophistry or affectation. The second factor is the support of the international community in the attainment of solutions which  safeguarding democracy and the rule of law  will make possible equitable social development for all in our communities  who yearn so for progress and justice.The lesson has been a cruel and painful one  but our hope has remained unshaken: the hope that we shall emerge from this time of trial  which has made us Central Americans fully aware that notwithstanding all the marginal disagreements we are United  not merely in our past  but also in our present and our future.We are pacifists by calling  by loyalty and by experience. In that context of feelings and ideals  the foreign policy of El Salvador has contributed - and contributes increasingly - to the strengthening of regional and international peace and security in all spheres. That policy adheres to the principles and norms governing friendly relations among States.As tangible proof of the principles that guide and define our foreign policy  I am pleased to note the considerable progress made with respect to the peaceful settlement of the border dispute with Honduras  both in terms of the proceedings before the International Court of Justice  to which both countries have turned in a spirit of harmony  and in terms of the technical work of demarcation in the border areas delimited by the 1980 peace treaty. With respect to the Court's proceedings  my Government reaffirms its unequivocal willingness to comply with the Court's decision. That shows the commitment to peace which is the most evident example of the way we wish to see relations among Central American countries develop.El Salvador  like the majority of countries represented here  is sometimes frustrated and concerned to see that many international incidents  far from showing signs of a peaceful solution  seem to be getting worse and more deeply rooted. But I must say that we have faith and hope that the remaining international disputes can be resolved through sincere dialogue aimed at creating conditions conducive to the political understandings necessary for peace.El Salvador knows that the solution to today's problems and conflicts must be approached and achieved in the light of the pre-eminence of political will  tolerance  wisdom and respect. Only in that way can we make secure progress towards true international justice  guaranteeing the well-being and survival of mankind.In that respect we welcome the mediating efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whom we fully support in his arduous task of trying to help resolve the dispute between Iran and Iraq. We appeal to the parties to the dispute to respect the resolutions of the Security Council and  as we in Central America are now doing  to engage in dialogue in a climate of reason in which mutually beneficial agreements can be adopted.Likewise  El Salvador  with respect for and in full observance of the norms of international law  considers that the question of Korea must be resolved by peaceful means  through resumed dialogue and negotiations between South Korea and North Korea.Peace is at hand.It will be appreciated that El Salvador is a country all of whose energies are devoted to the achievement and maintenance of world and regional peace. If the little word ""peace"" has been uttered often in this statement it is because  for us  it is not merely a lofty aspiration; it is a spiritual commitment that supports and encourages us even in the worst circumstances. Our country is small  poor and long-suffering  but today it stands at one of the focal points of modern history. We have thus emerged from anonymity to play a leading role in one of the great battles of our time. We know that is a role we must take on with bravery and dignity.The coming 5 November is an important multiple anniversary for Central America: 90 days after the signing of the Esquipulas II agreement  the five basic peace commitments will enter into force simultaneously in the five countries. On 5 November 1811  in the church of La Merced at San Salvador  the first cry for Central American independence was heard.The coincidence on that great day of events associated with independence  pacifism  freedom and nationhood prompts me to invite my fellow Foreign Ministers of the Executive Committee to meet on that date at San Salvador  in keeping with the schedule of meetings  so that we can be first-hand witnesses to the crucial moment and jointly declare to the world the entry into force of these long-awaited agreements  in an act of historic responsibility and political will befitting the occasion. If this takes place  we should thus be able on 7 November to report to our regional organization  the Organization of American States  on the success of this great regional endeavour.  I affirm that we never have evaded and never shall shirk this enormous challenge  in which freedom and democracy are at stake. I am sure that I speak for all Salvadorians when I say to this Assembly - from which we seek a resolution unequivocally supporting Esquipulas II - that El Salvador will continue to work for peace and harmony  with good faith and hope.Mindful that we have made progress and that peace is at hand  we shall fully and unswervingly implement all the agreements undertaken in Esquipulas II  in the hope that the other countries will do the same  honouring their word and their dignity.We hope our humble contribution will help the free  just and humane world we all want become an increasingly tangible reality for all the peoples of the earth.

"128",6370,"SOM",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of Somalia  I extend our sincere congratulations to Mr. Peter Florin on his unanimous and well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation in the successful discharge of his responsibilities. I take this opportunity to express our appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Huraayun Rasheed Choudhury  under whose skilful guidance there were significant achievements at the forty-first session.I wish also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for his active role in promoting just and peaceful solutions to international problems.This session of the General Assembly  like others before it  has a long agenda covering a wide range of topics  I think it is true to say  however  that there are just three broad categories into which those items fall - namely  peace and security  self-determination  and human rights. It is to those three areas that the purposes and principles of the Charter ace directed. I believe it to be essential that we never lose sight of those purposes and principles as we address ourselves to the specific problems before us.We must ask ourselves  for example  whether the world community is taking effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. Is the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples being fully respected? Is there effective international co-operation to promote fundamental freedoms and human rights  including the right to economic and social stability? The extent to which we can answer these questions in the affirmative is the extent to which our obligations as Member States are being fulfilled. Obviously  there is a large gap between the statement of the goals we profess to seek and the attainment of those goals  and the effort to reduce that gap must be a constant one.With regard to peace and security  it can be said that these benefits ultimately depend on the widest possible compliance with all the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. However  world peace can today be more specifically identified with a strong commitment to disarmament and collective security  and particularly with full adherence to fundamental human rights. As a former colonial territory which achieved independence under the aegis of the United Nations  Somalia is particularly conscious of the importance of the right to self-determination and independence in the strengthening of regional and international peace and security. In our view  the world community owes a debt of gratitude to the framers of the Charter for affirming those rights at a time when the process of decolonisation was in its infancy and the likelihood of its success far from certain. It was their wisdom and foresight which provided the basis for the General Assembly's historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.Today  the concern expressed in the Charter and the efforts by the United Nations to promote self-determination have been strongly validated. One of the clearest lessons of the history of our times is that attempts to suppress the will of peoples to self-determination and independence inevitably lead to violence and conflict and are in the end doomed to failure. Oppressed people will make any sacrifice  including the sacrifice of their lives  in order to establish conditions of freedom  justice and human dignity.The task of creating a community of sovereign States with universality as the final goal is not yet completed  but the work of the United Nations in this area has strongly reinforced the hopes and dignity of millions of former colonized people in Africa  Asia  the Caribbean  the Pacific and other areas who have recovered their national identity and now enjoy statehood. Somalia believes that the completion of this task must be a high priority of the United Nations. It has been said that peace  in the last resort  is a matter of human rights. I do not think there can be any question about the fact that gross violations of human rights  which undermine the dignity and worth of the human person  provoke both national and international tensions and conflicts. Somalia strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations on behalf of oppressed peoples. We believe that the world community must take an unequivocal stand when confronted by racist  aggressive and genocidal policies.The United Nations responsibilities in the promotion of human rights do not stop  however  with attempts to put an end to intolerable oppression. Its responsibilities must also include the creation of a climate in which all States have the opportunity to provide adequately for the economic and social needs of their peoples. This  undoubtedly  is the meaning of the Charter's injunction that we promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.It is against the background of these thoughts on peace  self-determination and human rights that I shall address myself to specific international issues of particular concern to Somalia The question to which we give the highest priority in our foreign policy is that of peace and stability in the Horn of Africa. Our region has suffered from decades of conflict and tension  from the ravages of drought and desertification and from the human misery caused by mass refugee flows. The establishment of a climate of peace and stability would enable the people of the region to carry out with greater success the tasks of rehabilitation and development.It was in recognition of this need that the Heads of State of Somalia and Ethiopia initiated a process of dialogue between the two countries at their meeting in Djibouti in January 1986. My Government is strongly committed to the success of the ongoing talks aimed at creating conditions for the normalization of relations  the resolving of fundamental problems and the establishment of a just and lasting peace. We believe it is a measure of progress that the last meeting of the Somali-Ethiopia Joint Committee held in April of this year agreed that the two sides would continue the dialogue and refrain from any action which might jeopardize the peace process.In our view a climate of confidence and trust must be created in which negotiations on substantive issues can be successfully pursued. We believe that the search for a just and lasting settlement could then go forward  based on a realistic appraisal of existing conditions and  most importantly  with a firm recognition of the legitimate aspirations and fundamental rights of the peoples involved. It is our firm conviction that respect for the inalienable rights of peoples to justice and self-determination constitutes a solid foundation for peace and stability in the area.In spite of some difficulties and setbacks  Somalia will continue to promote the peace process that has been set in motion - which would be in the interests  and contribute to the welfare of  all the peoples of the region. I should like now to state Somalia's position on another urgent and grave international problem: the tragic war between Iran and Iraq. It has continued for almost 8 years without any prospect of an end in sight. It has exacted a heavy toll in human lives  in the destruction of property and in the depletion of the resources of both countries.Somalia welcomed the Security Council's mandatory resolution calling for a cease-fire  which we considered to be an appropriate response to the destruction and bloodshed and to the widening repercussions of the war. We appeal to both sides and especially to Iran to respond speedily and explicitly to international efforts to end the hostilities and to achieve an honourable settlement. The good offices of the Secretary-General in this regard must certainly be given appreciation and support. Bringing an end to this tragic war is in the best interests of the peoples of the area  of Arab and Islamic solidarity and of regional world peace and security·In the Middle East  after decades of tension and conflict  the path to peace is still being obstructed by Israel's contempt for the rule of international law. Clearly  there will be no peace while Israel continues to deny the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  while it violates the human rights of the Arab people under its occupation and while it pursues expansionist policies of illegal annexation and occupation. The world community must demand an end to those policies and to the arrogant violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity ·My Government will continue to support United Nations resolutions calling for a comprehensive Middle East settlement  which would include the right of the Palestinians to return home and to establish a state in Palestine and Israel's withdrawal from all annexed and occupied Arab territory  including Jerusalem. We also support the convening of a peace conference on the Middle East as an important step towards a just and lasting settlement.The responsibility of Member States to promote human rights and remove threats to peace is nowhere heavier than in the case of southern Africa. My Government welcomes the increasing application of measures that demonstrate the world community's abhorrence of South Africa's apartheid policies. Regrettably  the apartheid system remains essentially in place  and institutionalised oppression against the majority population and against all who oppose apartheid has been intensified.Undoubtedly the situation in South Africa today is one of dangerous crisis  as the confrontation between the forces of oppression and those of the liberation struggle becomes increasingly violent. My Government strongly supports the international consensus on the need to impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the Pretoria regime. This is the only peaceful and effective measure available to the United Nations in its effort to promote the establishment of a just society in South Africa. The case for mandatory sanctions is  of course  further strengthened by South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia  and by its use of the Territory as a springboard for military aggression against sovereign States. In our view  it is the inescapable duty of the Security Council to take firm action to ensure that the plan for Namibia's independence contained in resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) is implemented speedily and without pre-conditions.In a number of other areas of conflict it is essential that international pressures continue to provide the momentum towards just and peaceful solutions. In this context  Somalia joins the vast majority of States in calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan. The independence  sovereignty and non-aligned status of Afghanistan must be fully respected  and the Afghan refugees must be allowed to return home in safety and with honour.On the question of Cyprus  we urge the parties concerned to take full advantage of the good offices of the Secretary-General in working for a peaceful settlement. In our view  the resolution of this problem lies in the recognition by all concerned that the fundamental human  civil and political rights of the ethnic groups which constitute the population of that island State  must be fully respected and safeguarded  if there is to be lasting peace and internal harmony.The strengthening of peace and security throughout the world depends more heavily  of course  on progress towards disarmament  in particular nuclear disarmament. Without doubt  the nuclear arms race overshadows all other issues in importance and urgency. That is why my Government warmly welcomes the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles. This development certainly has historic significance as it represents the first agreement  in principle  on the elimination of a specificclass of nuclear weapons. Of equal significance  in our view  is the spirit of co-operation which has fostered agreement in the crucial area of arms control. The world community is now encouraged to hope that a first step has been taken in a process which will lead to the elimination of long-range strategic missiles  to the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty  and to a freeze on the production and deployment of all nuclear weapons.I turn now to the economic issues that are of great concern to my Government. Unfortunately  the lack of progress towards the solution of international problems in the political sphere is also evident in the major economic problems before the General Assembly.The stalemate in efforts to establish a North-South dialogue and to promote a more just world economic order is again cause for disappointment and concern. For African States  the question of greatest urgency is the economic situation on our continent - a situation that continues to generate unacceptable levels of deprivation and misery. The worst ravages of natural and man-made disasters have abated  but one year after the convening of the Special Session on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa  it cannot be said that the crisis on our continent is over. The pervasive constraints of underdevelopment and the effects of climatic and other disasters cannot be overcome easily.For example  Somalia has been host for over seven years to successive mass influxes of refugees. Even though basic needs are met through international assistance  the presence of 700 000 refugees in official camps  and as many more in the country at large  continues to place a heavy burden on our weak infrastructure  economy and resources. We naturally hope that efforts to create a climate of peace in the region will help to promote the optimum solution to the refugee problems - that of voluntary repatriation  unfortunately  the majority of the refugees are still not assured that they can return home to safe and stable conditions. My Government is grateful to the donor countries and United Nations agencies which have given the refugees a measure of hope for the future. Nevertheless  I must take this opportunity to make an urgent appeal for the fulfilment of food aid pledges. At the present time  there are serious food shortages and outbreaks of nutrition-related diseases in many camps  and unless speedy and effective measures are taken the situation could soon become catastrophic·  We hope that generous and prompt support for immediate and medium-term needs will continue to be made available to the refugees  in accordance with the commitments made at the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa.I believe there must be great recognition of the direct connection between the economic plight of developing countries and the constraints of the existing world economic order. It should be stressed that when the developing countries call for a North-South dialogue on interrelated questions of trade  money  debt servicing and development  they are not speaking of ideologies or economic abstractions. They are speaking of matters of life and death. They are speaking of the need to overcome conditions of widespread hunger  poverty  ignorance and disease.Somalia strongly supports United Nations policies and programmes dealing with the related questions of the environment  population and human settlements. We believe that the promotion of the status of women  the rights of the child and the needs of youth  the aging and the disabled admirably carry out the humanitarian and social purposes o£ the world body. Campaigns against such evils as racial discrimination and the traffic in drugs illustrate the continuing vitality and relevance of the Organization.We are all aware that many issues in critical areas of peace and security  self-determination and human rights remain unresolved. This calls for deep concern because all the goals of human endeavour and human aspirations are encompassed by these three fields of international action. My delegation is encouraged by the fact that practical solutions  based on the principles of the Chatter  have proved successful in many critical situations that have come before the United Nations. Those solutions reflect the collective wisdom of the world community  and thereby bring moral pressure to beat on events.To conclude  the United Nations must continue to remain the centre for promoting the rule of international law and for fostering co-operation among States for the good of all. In this unique human endeavour  the United Nations can always depend on the full support and co-operation of the Government and people of Somalia. "
"129",6439,"SUR",42,1987,"﻿I come before this General Assembly for the third time to complete a story which I began to tell just one year ago.I come before you today because in my country  as in many countries around the world  the promise of freedom is held sacred.I come before you today because just two days ago the people of Suriname made their voices heard/ they express а desire for а new life and a new beginning. I come before you today to tell you that the people of Suriname have just written their own Constitution  I come before you today because the seeds of revolutionary change planted in 1980 are bearing fruit and nourishing the lives of the people of Suriname· The people of Suriname are on the eve of choosing their representatives through free and fair elections  on the basis of their Constitution.Our history since 1980 has been one of turbulence  of endeavouring to chart a course consistent with the wants and needs of our people· We are a country with a past similar to that of many of you. Suriname was a colony/ ruled by a distant Government which viewed our people and our natural wealth as their rightful property. The very diverse cultures which comprise our society were exploited  and the tensions between them deliberately and maliciously cultivated to prevent the development of a unified nation. This delayed our independence and  when self-determination was realized  remnants of our past continued to hinder our growth.In 1980 steps were taken finally to erase the stains of our colonial subservience. We could no longer sit idle while the fabric of Surinamese society was disintegrating and decaying. So some of us acted  not without provocation  and certainly not for purposes of personal grandeur. Our cause was the sanctity of Suriname  our goal was the betterment and prosperity of its people. At that time  in 1980  the military pledged to return control to a civilian government. We stated then that such a transition would take place when the social  economic  political and educational sectors of society had been reformed to accommodate a new Suriname  one which was capable of addressing the needs of all its citizens  rich and poor  Creole  Amerindian  European  Asian and African.As I have stated before in this Assembly  the process of nation-building in a country with a colonial past and a multi-ethnic population is a sensitive and difficult task. However  today I will offer no excuses  nor will I speak of obstacles still impeding our progress. For today it is my honour to reaffirm our pledge of seven years ago and introduce to the world a free and democratic Republic of Suriname.Two days ago  in the presence of international observers  our Constitution was approved. It is a document which was carved from the accumulated history  experiences and knowledge of our people. Several years ago a civil dialogue was begun which tapped the enormous resources of our community. It called upon representatives from a wide variety of political  social and economic interests. The energy we tapped from that body  and our thirst for a true democratic society  were transformed into a National Assembly  adding to the discussion formality and legitimacy. This was not merely a gesture of goodwill on the part of the Government; the creation of that body was an act necessitated by the maturation of Suriname’s body-politic; it was an act of love for the land which is Suriname and an act of faith in the hopes and abilities of its people.The National Assembly set out to draft a document which would form the foundation for a free and open Suriname. The document  which has been ratified by the people  finds its strength and validity in the widest range of political participation in the country's history. It is a law from the people  for the people. And on 25 November  just weeks from today  general elections will be held and an era of civilian control will commence.The army is ready and willing to accept the results of this process and is committed to defending and securing the national integrity and sovereignty of Suriname against intervention and interference.These are historic times for the people of Suriname. But they have not been attained without sweat  sacrifice and  unfortunately  the loss of lives. The path to democracy has been laden with numerous and unforeseen obstacles. Through the course of our journey  we have encountered the vagaries of the international economy} we have dealt with the uncertainty of chatting a course which diverts from our colonial past; and most regrettably  we have faced the bullets of those who sought to undermine our efforts. It is this last hurdle which proves most distressing for the Surinamese people. For in combating these parasites  innocent men  women  and children have been struck down  caught in the crossfire of a conflict they detested but found themselves powerless to escape. This fighting has exacerbated the economic woes which were unforeseen and unjustly imposed upon our country. When the last vestiges of colonialism saw fit to hold economic stability hostage to the direction of internal policy  they condemned the people of Suriname to a future of uncertainty and hardship. In the wake of this callous action  violence erupted. The perpetrators did not act out of some lofty quest for prosperity  but out of an obsession for personal vengeance and as stooges of colonialism. The people of East Suriname saw no alternative but to flee the country for neighbouring French Guiana  seeking refuge from a war which was fracturing their existence. We should like these people to return to their homes. They are citizens of Suriname and should feel secure in their own country. We have called upon the International Committee of the Red Cross  in consultation with the Government of France  to assist in this process on a permanent basis. But  most importantly  we must demand that those Governments and parties supporting or encouraging the violence in our country immediately stop their actions. The lives being lost are not being lost for any cause at all - our people are dying in vain.In the name of democracy  external Powers supported and encouraged a continuation of this senseless violence. Behind the barrel of a gun they pretended to bring democracy to Suriname. They have committed themselves to the disruption of the process which is currently under way  a process that is proving so successful and is cherished so much by the people of Suriname. How  then  can democracy be a goal of those who support terrorism in the Republic of Suriname? How  for that matter  can terrorism serve the people anywhere in the world?At this point I take the opportunity of expressing the gratitude of the Surinamese people to those countries that have variously supported us in our plight; at the same time  we look forward to increasing understanding and support from other nations. I wish to pause here to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside over the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am sure that under your guidance and leadership many of the crises facing the world will be dealt with in a rational prudent and effective manner.I take this opportunity also to congratulate Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh on the outstanding way in which he presided over the last session of the General Assembly. To our congratulations we want to add our best wishes for his future endeavours.My friends  there is trouble all around us. Brother is fighting brother in the Middle East  Asia and Central America. Repression continues in its most barbaric forms in southern Africa. And it was inevitable that so far most representatives in the General Assembly should have dealt with these major international crises. And while the scope and nature of these crises would justify lengthy discussion  on this occasion it will suffice for us to refer to our contributions at previous sessions of the Assembly. The Government of Suriname commends the efforts of the Central American Presidents to bring about a regional peace treaty. We whole-heartedly endorse the efforts of the Security Council and of Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Gulf·Like the people of the rest of the world  the Surinamese people have welcomed the concrete steps taken by the super-Power s towards the lessening of the nuclear threat. But any form of international peace that is achieved can be sustained only if the resources thus released ate used to recreate the international economic order. The suffering part of mankind cannot find relief in the absence of a nuclear threat alone. Now  however  I must return to the question I posed just moments ago; what is democracy  and how can such a noble objective lead to the violence and death which pervade too many of our lands? Democracy can mean many different things to many different people. By strict definition  democracy represents the principles of social equality and respect for the individual. Those are simple-enough concepts. Yet they are so difficult to realize. Democracy is an abstract idea which is not easily grasped. It is a fragile state of being which must be nurtured  cultivated  taught. If stretched to its limits unnaturally  it deteriorates into chaos and lawlessness. But if it is not permitted to blossom and take on characteristics unique to its adherents  it lacks the strength and vitality to be fruitful. There is no monopoly of wisdom in this world; nor is there a monopoly of virtue- Each one of our nations strives to realize a degree of national freedom and dignity consistent with its concept of democracy. It is a system whereby opposing and divergent views may flourish or perish on the merit of their wisdom. To the great Powers of the world I repeat that. There is no monopoly on wisdom; nor is there a monopoly on virtue.Further  I say the following to them. You possess tremendous attributes and have harnessed the most awesome and fearsome powers of earth. Yet too often you lack the simple capacity for understanding and empathy. You insist that your way is the right way and spurn those who seek to discover truth for themselves. I beseech you not to prejudge  but to permit the developing nations of the world the same opportunities as you had. So many of us in the Non-Aligned Movement want only to venture down a path of our own choosing. Yet too often first steps ate marred by the norms established by both sides of the rhetorical battle. If your concern for our future were based on a genuine concern for the welfare of our people  the intrusion might be more palatable.There is so much we can teach you and  of course  we can learn from you. But for this transfer to take place  for this union to occur  there must be mutual trust and respect. This cannot be fostered in an atmosphere of fear and ideological self-righteousness.You  the leading members of the international community  can guide the world to a more stable and lasting peace. Your wealth should not be used as a political tool to force compliance with your policies or adherence to your beliefs. If your positions are sound and well-founded  time will bear this out. Aid for development is the key with which to unlock the cultural/ historical and  of course  economic riches which so many of our countries possess  but which lie unexplored and unutilised. The misunderstanding which plagues so much of the international arena  the political aggression which manifests itself in violence  and the economic plight which threatens not only the smaller debtor nations but the entire world community are merely symptoms of unwillingness to compromise with peoples of different minds.In this regard  I make the following appeal to representatives of the international media covering today's proceedings. Their words and perspectives reach millions and shape the opinions of the world's inhabitants. The burdens weighing upon a country and its people can be lessened if the lines of communication are kept open and are kept free of sensational journalism aimed at increasing circulation rather than airing both sides of a controversy. I urge them to realize and accept the awesome responsibility of their position and act in an honourable and just manner.In Suriname we are embarking on a new phase of our life an important aspect of which is our endeavour really to become an organic part of the Latin American and Caribbean region  I extend my Government's heartfelt appreciation to those who have aided us throughout our struggle. Naturally  we will learn from our trials and tribulations  and in the phase that we have now entered we will  in dealing with both domestic and foreign issues  take chances which can lead to broader understanding and co-operation. Without respect  understanding and co-operation  the future of mankind is destined to be far more difficult than we imagine and we will achieve much less than each of our nations now envisages.I came before the Assembly  Mr. President  mainly to set the record of my country straight - the record of our past  our present and cur future. We know that the expectations of happiness and prosperity of the people of Suriname are the same as those of all the peoples of our world  and that is no wonder  for they reflect the noble goals enshrined in the Charter of our Organization  the United Nations. We  like the rest of the world  are therefore justified in expecting all possible support from this Organization in achieving our goals. While it will take some time to solve all our major problems  we hope that our noble Organization  the United Nations  will before long be in a position to present to the world encouraging beginnings of solutions that are long overdue.

"130",6533,"SWE",42,1987,"﻿Allow me first  Mr. President  to congratulate you on your election to preside over the forty-second session of the General Assembly. You can count on the full support of my delegation in carrying out your important task. Is there some flaw in the design of the human species? Is there any possibility for us to change before it is too late?These questions were raised in a speech by the much beloved Swedish writer of children's books  Astrid Lindgren. The title of her address was; ""Violence  never""Astrid Lindgren answered the questions herself by pointing to the children. It must begin with them  she said.Children who encounter repression and violence themselves use violence when they grow up. Children who are received with love and respect themselves acquire a loving attitude to the world around them.Children do not make a distinction between black and white  yellow and brown. To children  other children are simply children  regardless of their origin  their language or the colour of their skin.My country  Sweden  used to be an ethnically homogeneous society. During the last few decades it has been transformed into a multinational and multiracial country. Certain suburbs of the nation's capital count more than a hundred nationalities  representing all parts of the world.Adults like ourselves should learn from children. We should avoid letting racial prejudices create antagonism between human beings. We must launch an attack against the evils of racism  wherever they may occur.Racism is senseless. It jumps to conclusions regarding the merit and characteristics of human beings on the basis of such superficial matters as the colour of their skin or hair; racism is pitiable. It often acts insidiously  fawningly and treacherously.Racism is cowardly. It hides behind false phrases and spreads its poison in the dark.Racism is egoistic. It denies and counteracts solidarity and co-operation. It pits man against man.Racism is cruel. It constantly commits horrid crimes and acts of war and violence.Developments in South Africa give cause for deep concern. The regime's hardening attitude since the May elections is ill-considered and tragic. The brutal outrages against the opponents of apartheid  trade union leaders and their organizations  and the escalated destabilization policy against neighbouring countries have seriously impaired prospects of a peaceful solution.The determination of the minority regime to uphold the apartheid system must be met by the international community with increased pressure and firmer demands for change. This is necessary if we want to contribute towards breaking the violence and making way for a peaceful dismantling of the apartheid system. This must be brought about now. Otherwise  it will be too late.The abolition of apartheid is the concern of the entire international community. A special responsibility rests with the permanent members of the Security Council.It is disappointing that the Security Council has not yet been able to decide on effective  mandatory sanctions against South Africa. Pending such sanctions  Sweden and the other Nordic countries have extended their previous unilateral measures and introduced a general ban on trade with South Africa and Namibia  We hope that these measures will lead to other countries' following suit  thereby increasing pressure on the South African Government  South Africa's occupation of Namibia continues. We support the Secretary-General's efforts to break the deadlock. A solution must be based on Security Council resolution 435 (1978)   without irrelevant conditions.The countries of southern Africa have been hit very hard by the South African policy of destabilization. Increased bilateral and international development co-operation efforts are imperative in order to give them support and to reduce their dependence on South Africa. Assistance to southern Africa constitutes a very important part of Sweden's bilateral development aid. In the last five years about $1.5 billion has been allocated to the region.Mobilizing and co-ordinating such efforts should be an important task of the United Nations. Assistance to the victims of apartheid policy and humanitarian aid to the liberation movements should also be increased.Increased support for the front-line States would also create a more favourable start for the entire region - including South Africa - the day apartheid is abolished.The war between Iran and Iraq has caused immense human suffering and enormous material losses.Recent developments in the Gulf imply great risks of escalation and widening of the conflict. All the parties concerned must  in this explosive situation  exercise the utmost restraint. The Swedish Government welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The resolution provides a good basis for a solution to the conflict and must be complied with. It is also a matter of the authority of the Security Council. The Secretary-General has my Government's whole-hearted support in his renewed efforts.In the Middle East  Israel's long occupation of Arab territories constitutes a dangerous threat to both Arabs and Israelis. Agreement on an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations would bring to the region hope of peace and of an end to the occupation. Sweden supports the efforts to bring about such a conference.The foundations for a settlement are laid down in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Israel must leave the territories that were occupied in 1967. The Arab parties must recognize Israel's right to exist within secure borders. Furthermore  the Palestinian people must be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination and the right to establish a State of their own  It is important that the Palestinians be represented in negotiations by those in whom they have confidence. In our view the Palestine Liberation Organization enjoys such confidence.In violation of international law  the Soviet Union continues its war in Afghanistan  now in its eighth year. The Soviet invasion forces must be withdrawn. The Afghan people themselves must be allowed to decide their own form of government and their future. That is imperative for success in the efforts to settle the conflict and to enable the millions of Afghan refugees to return to their homes. The efforts of the Secretary-General to that end has the Swedish Government's strong support.To resolve the conflict in Kampuchea  it is equally crucial that the Vietnamese troops be withdrawn and that the Kampuchean people be allowed to decide their own future. The Swedish Government has noted with interest the recent contacts concerning the country's future. We hope that this development signifies the beginning of a real dialogue.We welcome the agreement that has been concluded between the Governments of Sri Lanka and India on a return to peaceful relations between the ethnic communities in Sri Lanka. There are now better prospects that this distressing conflict can be resolved in a peaceful way. It is our hope that the increased activity shown by the two Korean States in their endeavours to resume their dialogue will be successful.The agreement reached in August between the five Central American countries is an important step towards peace and co-operation in a region that has long been troubled by conflicts. These have their roots in social and economic injustices. They have been aggravated by foreign intervention  such as United States support - in violation of international law - for those who are waging war against Nicaragua's lawful Government. We welcome the fact that the Government of Nicaragua  through recent positive measures  is clearly demonstrating its will to implement the peace plan  in spite of the aggression directed against that country. The agreement expresses the aspirations of the Central American countries to shape their own future in accordance with their own wishes. Implementation requires the support of the entire international community. Everyone  in and outside the region  must be guided by the fundamental principles of the agreement: respect for international law and democracy. One condition for success is that assistance to the irregular forces cease. The Contadora countries and their Support Group  as well as the Organization of American States and the United Nations  have an important role to play in the continued peace efforts. As the President of Costa Rica  Mr. Arias  put it recently in Washington  ""We have to give peace a chance"".Through its peace-keeping operations  the United Nations has in several cases been able to assist the parties to regional conflicts in cooling off the situation  thereby facilitating the search for a peaceful solution. Sweden's long-standing  active support for these operations is illustrated by our decision last year to pull a logistic unit at the disposal of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) .Our positive attitude towards participation in peace-keeping operations remains. That applies also to the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). We regret that  above all  the unreasonable method of financing has forced us to withdraw out battalion from Cyprus. It is increasingly intolerable for such a ļ United Nations operation to be financed that extensively by the troop-contributing countries. Sweden will continue to participate with police and headquarters personnel in the United Nations peace-keeping operation in Cyprus in the future also. The efforts of the Secretary-General to bring the parties together have out undiminished support.	 Violence and oppression must be combated. That is the only way to create the necessary conditions for a lasting peace for future generations.One of the main purposes of the United Nations is to protect and promote human rights. With the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as its foundation  an impressive structure of norms has emerged. International conventions on the protection of human rights have been adopted. More recently a convention against torture entered into force. It is important that States accede to these conventions. All States must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.There is every reason to stress the significance of the struggle against international terrorism  with its destructive violence. Co-operation within the United Nations and other international forums is of immense importance. It is our hope that the General Assembly during this session will reach agreement on increased co-operation in this field.The narcotic-drugs problem has acquired world-wide proportions. At the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held in Vienna last summer the participating States pledged to undertake forceful international measures to counteract drug abuse. In order to fulfil that undertaking  it is essential that the United Nations obtain the necessary resources to play a central role.The importance of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) was highlighted at its meeting this summer. The Final Document shows an awareness of the interdependence of countries and the close relationship between different growth-promoting measures. The outcome of the conference was positive. It is now the responsibility of all Governments to fulfil the intentions of the Final Document in a constructive spirit. Two threats of annihilation hover over mankind: nuclear war and global degradation of the environment. The first can be unleashed at any moment} the second would take longer. If we do not have the ability to remove these threats  human civilization is in danger.Two years ago our hopes of progress in the disarmament field were strengthened. At that time the leaders of the two super-Powers made their historic declaration; nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.The Swedish Government welcomes the agreement in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear weapons. But it would be a serious set-back if these disarmament measures were to result in an arms build-up in other fields. It is essential that progress be achieved as soon as possible also in the current negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons and space weapons.A comprehensive nuclear-weapons-test ban is becoming increasingly important. A test-ban agreement would render more difficult the development of new and ever-more-advance d types of nuclear weapons. It would also reduce the risk of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Such an agreement would be a definite sign of the will of the nuclear-weapon States to break the vicious circle of the arms race.In the shadow of the nuclear-weapon threat  there are other weapons of mass destruction also. Some are more than a threat. At this very moment people are suffering from the horrible effects of chemical weapons. We now have before us an opportunity to save future generations from those weapons  with continued progress at the negotiating table of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  a convention banning chemical weapons could become a reality in the near future.Nor must we tire in our endeavours to reduce conventional arms at both the global and the regional level. Within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe there seem to be good prospects for reaching agreement on further developing the confidence- and security-building measures agreed upon at the Stockholm Conference last year. There also seem to be good prospects for initiating negotiations on conventional disarmament in Europe within that framework.The Swedish Government actively supports the idea of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Nordic area and a corridor free of battlefield nuclear weapons in Central Europe Increased attention should be paid also to the naval arms race. It is high time that negotiations were initiated on confidence-building measures and disarmament in this field too. An appropriate first step could be a multilateral agreement on the prevention of incidents at sea to supplement existing bilateral agreements.The world must choose development instead of the arms race. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was a success for multilateral diplomacy. It is our hope that those who did not take part in the Conference will participate in the continued process. We are responsible for the world we leave to future generations. The World Commission on Environment and Development  under the chairmanship o£ the Prime Minister of Norway  Gro Harlem Brundtland  has shown convincingly how important it is to bring about sustainable development. If that development concept is applied  we can save our environment and safeguard our natural resources. If we do not manage to do this  economic and social progress will be impossible  and in the long run the survival of mankind will be jeopardized.The current agenda of the General Assembly contains items concerning draft resolutions from the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme on the report of the World Commission and on the action-oriented environmental perspective. We sincerely hope these will be adopted this autumn. If they are  a process could be initiated in which the decision-making bodies of the United Nations could revise policies  programmes  budgets and activities with the aim of promoting sustainable development. Similarly  all Governments should review their own national policies. That process has already been initiated in Sweden. Far-sighted management of natural resources and preservation of the environment will  furthermore  be established as one of the five objectives for Swedish International development co-operation.As proposed by the Brundtland Commission  a second global conference on the human environment should be considered. Its aim could be to review developments since the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  to evaluate and assess the hazards posed by environmental problems and to agree on a programme of action to ensure sustainable development.If there is wide support for that proposal  a new conference could take place in 1992  that is to say 20 years after the first Conference. Sweden is prepared again to act as host  if that is the general wish. The United Nations are going through a critical period of self-examination and change. To overcome the difficulties  commitment and patient work are required of all Member States. A good foundation for reform work was laid last year by the General Assembly  on the basis of the report of the Group of 18. The aim of the reform process cannot be budget cuts as such} the overall aim must be to attain a world Organization that is well equipped to perform its functions.The purpose of the altered budget procedure we have agreed on is to make it possible for the programme budget to be adopted with the greatest possible support from Member States. In that way  the preconditions can be created to secure the necessary support for the activities of the United Nations.If the reform process is to be successfully completed  it is of utmost Importance that all Member States should fulfil their financial obligations under the United Nations Charter. That applies not least to the Organization's largest contributor. Otherwise  the consequences could be devastating.There is reason to recall the ideas on a more even scale of assessments put forward by Sweden's late Prime Minister  Olof Palme  at the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. That would be one way of making the world Organization less vulnerable. As things stand now  the scale of assessments agreed on has ceased to function. If this unsatisfactory state of affairs continues  we shall inevitably have to consider a revision of the scale of assessments.The future agenda of the United Nations will have an orientation that is partly different from the one it has today. We are increasingly faced with issues and problems of global importance. Such challenges cannot possibly be met through national or regional measures only. For the Swedish Government  the conclusion is obvious: it is through more efficient and purposeful co-operation within the framework of the United Nations and the United Nations system that we can effectively tackle these types of issues. This applies to the threat posed by nuclear weapons  environmental degradation  and North-South injustices. It applies to serious diseases such as AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)  to the increasing drug abuse  and to refugee problems.The United Nations system must be capable of adapting to these realities  but it is not changes in the purposes and principles of the United Nations set forth in its Charter that are required. The rules of international law embodied in the Charter must be unconditionally upheld. What is needed is to review and reconsider the structure and work methods of the United Nations system. The world Organization must be capable of effectively meeting the requirements of the 199Us and beyond. This applies not least to the economic and social sector.But it is not just a question of being prepared for tomorrow. We must also make better use of the machinery the United Nations offers today.Co-operation within the United Nations symbolizes hope for a life without fear  a life in peace and dignity for all people. It is our compelling duty to keep that hope alive. "
"131",6571,"SWZ",42,1987,"﻿Allow me at the outset. Sic  to convey to you  on behalf of my Head of State His Majesty King Mswati III  the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland  our warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election to guide the deliberations of this session is indeed a clear indication of the confidence the Assembly has in you as a diplomat of outstanding ability and profound experience in world issues. I have no doubt that under your eminent guidance and with your skilful advice the Assembly will be able to tackle effectively at this session the many pressing and difficult global problems facing mankind today.I should like also to express my delegation's sincere gratitude to your predecessor  Ambassador Rasheed Choudhury of the Republic of Bangladesh  fox having steered most capably our discussions in this Hall during the last session. We were deeply impressed by his inspiring leadership and discerning insight into the various matters of growing concern to humanity. His ingenuity in fostering the difficult but essential spirit of compromise and accommodation in the quest for solutions to international problems made an enormous contribution to the success of the last session.The delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland would also like to convey its hearty appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his entice staff for the invaluable service they have continued to render loyally to the international community by ensuring that this world body effectively fulfils its mandate to preserve international peace and security.Forty-two long and eventful years have now come and gone since the United Nations was founded in 1945. Since that date the Organization has played a role of paramount importance as an Instrument for fostering international peace and security and as an indispensable forum for International co-operation in an increasingly complex arid interdependent world. A great deal has been accomplished in the past 42 years. We have witnessed great changes in the world's political map. We have seen the dismantling of colonial empires and the emergence of many young nations from a position of total obscurity and foreign domination to their present status of full national sovereignty  in which today they play an increasing role in shaping the destiny of this planet. Although we rejoice at the achievements of the past 42 years  we are nevertheless painfully aware of the persistent presence on our planet of several obstinate pockets of resistance to the process of decolonization.There are also still areas where the noble principles of human equality and dignity are being consistently flouted and where a considerable amount of time and energy are still being devoted to devising an array of flimsily disguised political schemes to give a cloak of respectability to the inhuman practice of political domination and the exploitation of man by man. We are  however  convinced that no amount of glossy political schemes intent on side-stepping the central issues can replace the basic need for addressing the people's genuine aspirations for economic  social and political justice. We are equally convinced that no amount of internal repression or military forays into neighbouring countries can succeed in bringing lasting peace to a country that denies the majority of its population their basic right to freedom  economic justice and equal political participation in the country of their birth.As a peace-loving nation that strongly believes in resolving political differences by peaceful negotiations  Swaziland is deeply concerned about the growing crescendo of violence and political assassinations now spilling over into our own territory with increasing frequency. We are deeply concerned about this flagrant violation of our territorial integrity and we are convinced that the myopic policy of trying to silence one's political opponents by murdering them will not stem the tide of the people's demand for freedom and justice  but will only increase the amount of bloodshed and bitterness and thereby make it even more difficult for any subsequent reconciliation and peaceful co-existence to succeed.My delegation regards it as both unfair and unjust that the people of Namibia continue to be denied their birthright to self-determination and full national sovereignty by linking their independence to extraneous and totally unrelated considerations of mere ideological expediency. We  therefore  wish to appeal most earnestly  in the name of fairness and natural justice  for the people of Namibia no longer to be denied their right to freedom because of reasons of political ideology and international rivalry over which they have no control. We feel that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) should be implemented without any further delay. The prevailing political situation in southern Africa is not only breeding violence and considerable human suffering but also causes large numbers of refugees to flee into Swaziland from the neighbouring countries. In fulfilment of its obligations under the relevant International conventions  Swaziland makes every possible effort to give shelter and other humanitarian assistance to all such refugees. However  the refugee population in ray country has become so large that the Swaziland authorities are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with this task. Consequently  we are appealing to the international community for Increased assistance to enable us to meet the ever-increasing demand for basic facilities for these unfortunate human beings.There are a number of other conflict areas in the world today that continue to need the close attention of the United Nations. These include the seven-year old war between Iran and Iraq  the Palestinian question  Lebanon  Afghanistan  the Korean question  Kampuchea  Chad  Western Sahara and Central America  just to mention a few. Although some critics would point to those areas as evidence of the failure of the United Nations to solve international disputes  my delegation still believes that  given the necessary political will on the part of the international community  all these difficult problems can be resolved and peace restored to those trouble-torn areas.The war between Iran and Iraq is developing daily into a world conflict. The Security Council's unanimous resolution of July 1987 demanding a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq  with the threat of sanctions to enforce this demand  needs the whole-hearted support of all Member States. This unfortunate war is costing both countries enormously in both human and material resources. Hence  the Gulf war cease-fire resolution  considered one of the few mandatory directives the Security Council has unanimously approved in its 42-year history  is a timely and welcome step by the world Organization. We hope the Security Council will continue to demonstrate unanimity concerning other conflict areas in the world so as to bring peace and justice to all.In keeping with its strong belief in the principle of self-determination  Swaziland supports the inalienable right of the people of Afghanistan to determine the form and ideological complexion of their own government and the socio-economic structure of their own country without outside interference. It is in this context that my delegation commends the untiring efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to find a negotiated formula for achieving an early withdrawal of all foreign troops from that country. We therefore hope that an agreement on the question of a mutually acceptable time-frame for the withdrawal of foreign troops will soon be reached by the parties closely involved in this conflict  so that the Afghan people may be allowed once again to share their own destiny in peace.Equally  my delegation supports the United Nations resolution calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea and for the restoration of Kampuchea's independence and territorial integrity. We believe that an early end to outside intervention in the internal affairs of Kampuchea will make a positive contribution to the noble efforts of the countries of South-East Asia to establish a zone of peace in that part of the world.The tense political situation that continues to divide North and South Korea should not be allowed to escape the attention of this world Organization. We therefore wish to urge the international community to continue to encourage the process of achieving the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation.Most developing countries  like mine  are heavily dependent upon a very limited range of primary commodities for their export earnings  with the result that wide price fluctuations in world commodity prices of our young  fledgling economies. The unemployment problem in the developing countries is fast approaching crisis proportions and is threatening serious consequences for the socio-political stability of those young countries. Unemployment is rising not only as a result of stunted economic growth in most developing countries  but also because the numbers for whom jobs must be found are multiplying at rates that far outstrip the sluggish pace of economic growth in those countries.The economic problems of the developing countries are further compounded by generally low commodity prices and unfavourable exchange rates which cause severe balance-of-payments difficulties and the chronic shortage in those countries of foreign exchange to pay for essential imports and spare parts needed for production activities.The low prices of major export commodities and the unfavourable exchange rates give rise to another complicating dimension  namely  the increasing inability of many developing nations to cope with the mounting burden of foreign debts.My delegation is therefore convinced of the need for urgent and appropriate measures to be taken  on a global scale  to stabilize international exchange rates if the economies of the developing countries  which are heavily dependent upon foreign exchange earnings from primary commodity exports  are to be protected from the debilitating effects of wild exchange-rate fluctuations.My delegation believes that it is essential for the economic survival of developing nations that they be given all possible assistance to help them acquire the necessary capacity to process more and more of their own raw materials so as to generate much needed employment opportunities in those countries and to enhance the value of their exports and thus help to broaden the base of their economies and thereby reduce their presently high vulnerability to the vagaries of the international commodity markets. We are convinced that a strategy of locating the relevant processing industries nearer to the source of raw materials in the developing countries would be of immense economic advantage to both the exporting and the importing countries  in that it would bring about a substantial reduction in the high freight costs currently incurred in exporting bulky raw materials with a relatively low unit value.An industrial development strategy of this nature can be successful only if it is accompanied by willingness on the part of the developed nations to dismantle the existing plethora of tariffs and other protectionist measures that currently restrict access to the markets of the industrialized countries by processed or semi-processed goods from the developing nations.It goes without saying that any meaningful development programme in the developing countries can be successfully undertaken only if these countries have access to international loan capital with soft interest rates and reasonably long repayment periods. This would largely obviate the current problem of the heavy debt burden  which is proving too onerous for many developing nations.I conclude by expressing the hope that the General Assembly will find it possible at this session to address itself positively and constructively to the many pressing problems facing mankind in this decade. My delegation wishes to urge the Assembly to build bridges of peace to span the many yawning gulfs created by diverse and largely conflicting interests  so that freedom/ human equality and justice may one day truly prevail throughout the world."
"132",6646,"SYR",42,1987,"﻿Your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly is indeed gratifying  Sir  especially since you represent a country linked to Syria by close ties of friendship and co-operation.We were greatly satisfied by the success of the outgoing President in conducting the work of the forty-first session. We should like to express our appreciation to him  and to wish him and his friendly country continued success. I take this opportunity to put on record our appreciation of the strenuous efforts exerted by the Secretary-General and his assistants to strengthen the role f the United Nations in safeguarding and promoting international peace and security and creating better conditions for co-operation among States.The world is now moving towards an era of co-operation and détente  following period of tension and confrontation  and a wave of optimism therefore prevails on the international scene. While we join the international community in welcoming his trend  we sincerely hope that it will lead to the achievement of just solutions to issues afflicting some of the world's peoples  foremost among which are the usurpation of peoples' rights  racial discrimination  occupation  foreign hegemony  economic exploitation and the ever-widening gap between developed and developing countries.The principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter  the aim of which is to create a human society in which justice and security reign  ushered in new hope for a better future for mankind. It has been impossible  however  totally to fulfil those noble principles owing to the escalation of aggressive tendencies  the use or the threat of the use of force in international relations and the suppression of the will of peoples with a view to dominating them and their potential.In the international domain  the arms race poses the gravest dangers to humanity. Foremost among those dangers is the possibility of a nuclear world war  whether triggered by accident or by a sense of superiority. We therefore regard every effort to reduce nuclear weapons with a view to eliminating them completely an important factor that would help to strengthen international peace and security. Accordingly  we support the agreement in principle between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America with respect to the intermediate-range nuclear forces and tactical weapons. We consider it to be a positive step that could have considerable significance if it were followed by wider steps that would eliminate strategic nuclear weapons and lead to comprehensive and complete nuclear disarmament.Israel's possession and development of nuclear weapons and its participation in the ""star wars"" programme pose a direct and constant threat to security in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. It has become imperative to declare the Middle East region a nuclear-free zone in order to ensure peace and security there. The obstacle to the attainment of that objective is Israel's constant refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place its nuclear installations under international control  as well as its rejection of the system of international safeguards.The Syrian Arab Republic is well aware of the connection between disarmament and development. It is axiomatic that the world cannot continue to incur the enormous costs of the arms race while simultaneously investing  in an adequate manner  the necessary funds in programmes of economic and social development. Therefore  my country would support any agreement by the international community to embark on an ambitious disarmament programme that would release sufficient funds for investment in programmes of economic and social development in the world  particularly in the developing countries. Furthermore  Syria shares the conviction that the United Nations has a role to play in promoting disarmament and development  and hence in creating a general feeling of collective security. We support the initiative of the group of socialist countries calling for the establishment of a comprehensive system of international security. Such a system would be based on strengthening the role of the United Nations in the adoption of practical measures that would guarantee compliance with the provisions of the Charter and ensure their implementation. That is essential to respect for the sovereignty of States  their national independence and their territorial integrity and to the non-use of force in relations among States  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the right of all peoples to self-determination  the elimination of colonialism  racism  racial discrimination  apartheid and foreign occupation and domination.The Arab-Israeli conflict remains one of the most explosive regional conflicts and the farthest away from a just and lasting solution  despite the overall favourable international climate and the world-wide support for the convening of the International Conference under the auspices of the United Nations. That should not seem strange  since other regional conflicts  regardless of their intensity and destructiveness  can come to an end and just  realistic solutions can be found to them so long as neither of the parties claims to have God-given territories and rights - as is alleged by Israel.By retaining the occupied Arab territories and annexing some of them  and by building settlements there  Israel in no way adheres to the principles of international law or of the United Nations Charter. Instead  it acts - as is evident from the overall attitudes of its successive leaders - on the basis of metaphysical convictions and legendary tales backed by extremely reactionary and fundamentalist concepts.It is naive to believe that the often-spoken-of differences among the rulers in Tel Aviv are differences between those who accept giving up the occupied Arab territories and those who refuse to do so. Rather/ the difference is between  on the one hand  those who want to extract a formal Arab signature on a document relinquishing most of the occupied Arab territories as well as usurped Palestinian rights and  on the other  those who do not even admit the existence of occupied Arab lands and usurped Palestinian rights. In fact  there is no substantial difference among all the rulers in Tel Aviv in regard to maintaining Israel's voracious appetite for devouring Arab lands and building more settlements thereon. The ultimate objective of the rulers in Tel Aviv is to establish Greater Israel and impose its undisputed hegemony over the countries and peoples of the region. It is our conviction that the Israeli attitude to the international conference on peace in the Middle East should be interpreted only in the light of those facts. We ought to proceed sincerely from an objective assessment of Israeli intentions and not from illusions or the attempts of some to justify their support for or dealings with Israel. The international community can thus easily realize why Israel's rulers reject a genuine International conference and why the Israeli faction that accepts the idea of an international conference stipulates that it should be a mere umbrella for direct bilateral negotiations and have no authority whatsoever. The Tel Aviv rulers are all agreed on not establishing a genuine  just peace in the region.Israel's rejection of peace based on justice is inevitably a source of constant concern to the entire world  no matter how calm conditions may appear on the surface. It must also be a source of true concern also to the Israelis themselves  because violence generates violence  and Israel's extremist doctrine in fighting and attempting to humiliate the Arabs will in turn give rise to more violence and extremism. Israel's bitter experience during its invasion of Lebanon still lives in the memory and will remain an irksome nightmare for the Israelis for many years to come.Israel will never enjoy peace in our region  irrespective of its military might  so long as it continues to occupy any part of the Arab lands. Israel cannot for ever be protected by the unlimited support of the United States and the strategic alliance between them. Israel's imposition of its peace terms on Egypt did not and will not achieve true peace between Israel and the brother people of Egypt  no matter how hard the rulers in Cairo and Tel Aviv try to obscure these facts and mislead world public opinion. Syria believes that the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace depends on the total withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories and on guarantees of the national rights of the Palestinian people within the framework of an international peace conference  to be held under United Nations auspices  provided that the conference is genuine and has authority.The economic and social institutions of our sister country  Lebanon  have suffered grave disruptions. The people of Lebanon have suffered greatly from a devastating civil War and the brutal Israeli invasion  both of which brought tremendous destruction of property  acts of terrorism and the forcible evacuation of citizens.There is no question but that many have lost confidence in the Lebanese regime as a result of the assassination last June of Lebanon's Prime Minister Rash id Karami  a man who stood for dialogue and national reconciliation  and the failure so far to find the killers and those who backed them. It is regrettable that the Lebanese regime has not tried  as it should have  to benefit from Syria's great help and immense sacrifices  whose purpose was to save Lebanon from fighting and chaos and place it again on the path of dialogue and national reconciliation. Nevertheless  Syria - which is bound to Lebanon by family ties  a shared destiny security  history and common interests - will spare neither toil nor sacrifice to assist our Lebanese brothers in their effort to emerge from this dark tunnel. Moreover  Syria will continue to support the heroic Lebanese resistance until the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and the liberation of the last inch of Lebanese territory.The tense situation in the Gulf region is a cause of grave concern  particularly in the light of the enormous concentration of foreign military fleets. Of particular note is the flocking of the military vessels of Western countries  one after the other  in the wake of the arrival of the United States fleet  after the majority of their Governments had initially voiced reservations about sending them.The Syrian people in particular  and the Arab people in general  have the right to ask whether those huge concentrations of vessels are intended to ensure freedom of international navigation in the waters of the Gulf or are there to secure military bases in the region and restore the policy of spheres of influence  is the purpose of those military concentrations in the Gulf region to prevent the expansion of the war and limit its damage  or is it to embroil the other countries of the region in order to deplete all their resources and distract them from their essential national role of liberating the occupied Arab territories and recovering the usurped rights of the Palestinian Arab people?While posing those legitimate questions  we reaffirm our support for freedom of international navigation for all in the waters of the Gulf. We reaffirm our denunciation of attempts to expand the war and involve other countries in it and our belief in the importance of good-neighbourly relations and understanding between the Arab States of the Gulf and the Islamic Republic of Iran  as well as our demand that all foreign military fleets be withdrawn from the region.We all know that in recent years the international community has devoted a major part of its attention to the phenomenon of terrorism. I have previously stated from this rostrum our views on this subject. In our statement at the last session of the General Assembly we set out our views on terrorism and the distinction between terrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples for freedom. We also exposed the deliberate attempts to confuse terrorist acts - which are totally rejected and condemned - and the struggle of peoples against foreign occupation  colonialism and racism. We said also that the international communityis as much the victim of State terrorism as it is of terrorism by individuals. We have called upon the international community through the United Nations to engage in a joint effort to set rules and norms by which to draw a distinction between terrorist acts and the legitimate struggle of peoples for national liberation as provided for in the United Nations Charter and in numerous General Assembly resolutions. Accordingly  we have proposed the convening of an international conference to define terrorism and to differentiate it from the struggle of peoples for national liberation. We appreciate the positive attitude to that initiative adopted by regional and international bodies such as the League of Arab States  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement. We are pleased to note that the General Assembly has adopted the Arab position submitted by Syria for the inclusion of a new item on the agenda of this year's session of the Assembly with regard to the convening of an international conference to define terrorism and to set norms and standards to distinguish between terrorism and the struggle of peoples for national liberation. My delegation would be pleased to co-operate with other delegations in preparing a draft resolution on this subject for submission to the General Assembly for debate and adoption.The Group of Non-Aligned Countries  to which my country belongs  was established at the very outset on the concept of persistent work to ensure respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and to observe the application of those principles in dealings among States. On several occasions the Group exerted a constructive effort that had a positive impact on the international scene. We should like  therefore  to express our firm support of the Non-Aligned Movement and of its activities. We fervently call upon all States in the various groups to extend support and encouragement to the Movement  since it has proved on several occasions that it is a positive factor of benefit to the international community as a whole.Southern Africa still suffers from a tragic colonial situation due to the continued occupation of Namibia by the Pretoria regime in violation of United Nations resolutions  in particular Security Council resolution 435 (197Θ)  which includes the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. Also  the Pretoria regime continues to carry out acts of oppression  persecution and killing  and to impose the apartheid regime on the majority of the inhabitants of southern Africa. We should strongly condemn the close collaboration between the regimes of Pretoria and Tel Aviv  which is designed primarily to suppress the will of the Arabs and the Africans and to undermine the aspirations of their peoples. Those two racist regimes should be isolated in the international arena  and an end must be put to their racist and expansionist policies.The international community is duty bound to confront the challenges of the Pretoria regime. Likewise  the Security Council must adopt a resolution imposing on that regime the mandatory and comprehensive sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.In this context we laud the Organization of African Unity and its resolutions and decisions adopted at its successive conferences  the latest of which are the resolutions and the declaration of the twenty-eighth Summit Conference of the Organization of African Unity  held in Addis Ababa  which reaffirmed the practical measures to be taken by States in various fields in order to isolate and eventually eliminate the apartheid regime.The question of Cyprus remains a source of concern to the Mediterranean countries. Any solution to this problem should be based on the implementation of all relevant United Nations resolutions so as to safeguard the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus. We welcome the idea of convening an international conference on this subject under the auspices of the United Nations.We support the efforts of the Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea to reunite the Korean peninsula by peaceful means and to achieve the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea. We also support its call to transform the Korean peninsula into a zone of peace free from military bases and nuclear weapons.	.With respect to Afghanistan  we support the independence  sovereignty and non-alignment of that friendly country. We hope that the efforts exerted to solve the difficulties existing between Afghanistan and its neighbours  to which we are linked with close historical ties  will be successful. Likewise  we welcome the cease—fire declared by the Afghan Government  as well as its initiative to achieve national reconciliation. We also commend the praiseworthy efforts of the representative of the Secretary-General with respect to the Afghan question  and we hope to see a quick solution to the problem.We express our grave concern over the external pressures exerted upon Nicaragua and the interference in its domestic affairs. We regard as positive the measures agreed upon by the States of Central America in the capital of Guatemala on 7 August 1987 concerning the establishment of a firm and durable peace in Central America  measures which could contribute to enhancing the efforts of the States of the region to safeguard their independence and sovereignty. On this occasion  we commend the efforts exerted in this regard by the Contadora Group and the Latin American Support Group.The United Nations General Assembly exerted considerable effort in 1974 with respect to the adoption of a resolution on the establishment of the new international economic order. That order sets forth the structural changes as a policy based primarily on the concept of interdependence among the peoples of the world  rich and poor  to realize international security and global welfare. However  all of us know that this new international economic order has not been implemented because of the lack of political will on the part of most of the developed countries. Recommendations were adopted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development aimed at achieving some structural changes in the system of international economic relations  in general  and in trade and financial relations  in particular. Those recommendations  however  were not given due attention by the group of rich countries  while other recommendations that were translated into resolutions have not been implemented. The main cause of this painful state of affairs in international economic relations lies in the fact that the group of rich countries  while advocating the concept of interdependence among all nations  in practice do not act upon it. Their primary concern is rather to realize the maximum and most expedient profits  which is the extreme opposite of the concept of interdependence among peoples.It is strange that this policy  characterized by greed and short-sightedness  often backfires against the interests of the group of rich countries themselves  sometimes leading to controversies  protectionist measures and trade wars among them. We have already seen this take place on many occasions. The major losers in this unjust situation  however  are the developing countries  which still suffer from the deterioration of the prices of their raw materials and from the enormous burden they shoulder due to their international indebtedness  as well as from the protectionist measures imposed by the developed countries on their exports. Sufficient proof of this grave imbalance in current international economic relations is the fact that the developed countries control the fixing of prices of raw materials produced by the developing countries according to their own interests. At the same time  they are free to fix the prices of their manufactured goods according to their own interests too. As a result  unequal and unfair trade exchange relations ensue  to the detriment of the developing countries.The peoples of the world always look to the United Nations full of hope that the international Organization will meet its commitment towards issues of justice  peace and development. The United Nations role is highly significant and will have a profound effect if efforts are directed to the achievement of objective  non-selective solutions for chronic conflicts  foremost among which is the Arab-Israeli conflict  which poses a continuous and far-reaching threat to peace.Syria affirms its continued commitment to support and promote the role of the United Nations as a collective world instrument for fulfilment of the hopes pinned on it."
"133",6691,"TCD",42,1987,"﻿On behalf of the Chadian delegation I congratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside over the forty-second session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that under your leadership the session will examine vigorously and effectively the matters on its agenda. You may rest assured of the full co-operation of my delegation during this session. I should also like to express my delegation's gratitude and thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  who conducted the proceedings of the General Assembly at its forty-first session with such skill and tact.I wish to take this opportunity also to pay a well deserved tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for the tireless and constant efforts he has made to promote peace and development.We are happy to see a friend of Chad  Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed  occupying the place of the person responsible in the Secretariat for matters relating to the General Assembly. He can count on our support to succeed in his new tasks.In recent years my country  Chad  has experienced particularly difficult situations  which almost put into question its very existence as a State. Not only was there chaos because of the aggression and occupation carried out by Libya  but natural disasters added their calamitous consequences.For a long time Chad's enemies succeeded  through all kinds of tactics  in pitting Chadians one against the other  transforming an international dispute into merely a domestic one. Now that these sordid and dilatory manoeuvres have been exposed thanks to the awareness of all Chadians that they belong to one  single nation  united Chad has come face to face with its true enemy  its neighbour Libya  which because of its territorial greed and its desire for hegemony is occupying and attacking our country.Libyan aggression and occupation were unmasked at the beginning of this year through the heroic attacks of Chadian patriots  who destroyed the powerful air and land bases built by Libya on Chadian territory. Faaa  Ouadi  Doum  Faya  Zouar  Ounianga  Bardai  Wour and Aouzou have all become graveyards for the occupier and incontestable proof of its aggression against Chad.The powerful equipment of these air and land bases proves irrefutably that Libya had no intention of leaving Chad. On the contrary  the mass occupation of its townships deep inside internationally recognized borders clearly indicates the diabolical and hegemonistic designs of the Libyan regime.This Libyan aggression against Chad has today been recognized by all States who sincerely love peace  justice and freedom.On the basis of a still-born Franco-Italian agreement  the fascist and racist regime of Tripoli has since 1973 beleaguered the Chadian area of Aouzou  from which it organized armed aggression against the rest of Chadian territory  spreading its occupation over the whole area of Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti - some 550 000 square kilometres.Is there any need to remind you that Qadaffi dreams of creating a so-called United States of the Sahel  of which he would be the leader? According to Qaddafi's logic  Chad should serve as a stepping-stone to the achievement of these colonial objectives of another age.While reserving the right to use any means to recover the occupied territories  Chad is sparing no effort to bring Qaddafi back to his senses by peaceful means. Chad has always loyally co-operated with the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  set up in Libreville in 1977. This Committee has therefore been studying this conflict for ten years  but because of Libya's arrogant and contemptuous refusal to co-operate in its activities  theHoc Committee has to date been unable to take a final decision. Libya's bad faith and dilatory tactics  and its contempt for the Pan-African organization  for the United Nations system and for law in general are now well-established facts.This is proved by the fact that Libya did not attend the meetings of the Committee and of the Sub-Committee of Experts held from 28 to 29 April and 18 to 20 May 1987 at Libreville under resolution AHG/RES.ISB (XXII) of the OAU. By the same token  though explicitly invited by the OAU at its twenty-third summit meeting to take part in a meeting of Heads of State who were members of the Ad Hoc Committee on the dispute between Libya and Chad  Qaddafi did not deign to make the trip to Lusaka on 23 September 1987.Confronted with such a contemptuous attitude  the Chadian government thought it necessary to bring this dispute to the General Assembly so that the whole world would be aware of the barbarous actions of the Gaddafi regime. The inclusion of the question of the aggression and occupation of Chad by Libya in the agenda is in keeping with this logic.Our action is well founded for day after day Libya is violating the cease-fire requested by the Acting President of the OAU  to which it freely subscribed.Indeed  scorning  as usual  the appeal made by the Acting President of the OAU  Libya is obstinately continuing to violate Chadian air space  concentrate its troops on the border and in the area of Aouzou  and engage in massive recruitment of mercenaries of all nationalities  especially Palestinians and Lebanese.This bad faith was evidenced at Lusaka by Libya's refusal to accede to the Ad Hoc Committee's request that it hand over any relevant documentation within a month.In fact  Libya has no documentation to support its claims. It is merely playing for time. Because of all the international agreements between the administering Powers of Chad and Libya and those between independent Libya and Prance  and later between Libya and independent Chad  Aouzou is Chadian territory. We have brought proof of this to the Security Council just as we did before the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU. We defy Libya to do the same.When a State  like Qaddafi's Libya  defies the entire international community so blatantly  international law and morality demand that it be treated as an outlaw  that it be condemned for its acts and all the ills it causes other States and their peoples. Through me  Chad therefore calls on the international community to assume its responsibility and demand that Libya act in conformity with the law and with the relevant principles set forth in the United Nations Charter and in that of the OACJ  as well as resolution AHG/RES. 16 (I)  which enshrines the principle of the intangibility of frontiers inherited from colonial times. For this the international community must demand that Libya immediately and unconditionally withdraw its wild and barbarous hordes from Chadian territory. Moreover  the human and material losses inflicted on Chad by the Libyan regime are immeasurable. It goes without saying that Libya owes Chad compensation for war crimes  and the international community has a moral obligation to demand that Chad be compensated. The war of aggression the Tripoli regime is imposing against Chad has destroyed its entire economic infrastructure and disorganized its administration. The government of the Third Republic has attempted to restore State authority and rehabilitate the economy. The support of the international community has been decisive in implementing the reconstruction programme. In this connection  in November 1982 friendly countries and international organizations  together with the Government of Chad  laid down the main direction for such rehabilitation. In December 19S5 international solidarity was again demonstrated when we passed from the phase of rehabilitation to that of reconstruction and development. Here again  the conference of donor countries held at Geneva enabled Chad to work out a temporary development plan that is now being implemented  and that plan  if totally carried through within the necessary time-limits  would enable Chad to attain its 1978 growth level  which should constitute a solid basis for recovery of the national economy.Despite the encouraging results achieved in restoring the economy  many obstacles still remain. Indeed  so long as the production capabilities of other sectors of the economy are not strengthened  the State will remain alone to face the actual needs of Chadian society.The decrease in the price of cotton  Chad's main export  which represents 3 5 per cent of its budgetary resources  has considerably reduced our State's scope of action. The situation is even more serious since the cotton industry  which is the basis of most of our modern production and distribution sector and which is the country's main income-producing element  now has a serious deficit. This crisis has of course influenced the country's overall industrial activities. The budget deficit  which the State is attempting to contain  remains. Taxes on the export of cotton have been suspended  and the State must go deeper into debt to support that industry's restructuring activities. further  drought has gravely affected if not decimated livestock  which represents the other essential element of the national economy. This has brought total poverty to cattle raisers whose sole source of income was cattle breeding.Thanks to the assistance of certain international bodies the Government is trying to reconstitute herds  but such actions  encouraging as they are  require long-term planning in order to ensure proper health in the herds. In addition  the cattle raisers most affected should receive assistance either to reconstitute their herds or to shift to other productive activities.To problems involving the depletion of budgetary resources we must add the strict minimum the State must provide persons displaced either by Libya's war of aggression or by drought and desertification.In this connection the situation of the populations in the Bokou-Ennedi-Tibesti area deserves the special attention of the international community  and particularly of humanitarian organizations. Those populations  who were forced to flee the Libyan invasion in 1983  abandoning all their property  and who are today attempting to return to their recently liberated townships and villages  are the innocent victims of random bombings and other barbarous actions by the Tripoli regime.Such combined problems further reduce the financial means the State should normally be devoting to improving socio-economic structures. If the agricultural picture of 1986-1987 was relatively good thanks to sufficient rainfall throughout the national territory  the present year will be bad because of the unequal rainfall over time. Further  we are experiencing an increase in locusts and grasshoppers  which are estimated to number 1 400 000 per hectare in certain areas. That situation dangerously compromises the goal of food self-sufficiency set by the Chadian Government. After the heavy rains at the end of May and beginning of June the situation suddenly worsened throughout the month of July and drought has destroyed first growth in some areas. We are therefore again forced to address an appeal to the international community to express its solidarity once more and to help us to augment our own efforts.The economic recession  which has led the world to the present crisis  is far from over. For the developing countries of Asia  Latin America and Africa  the crisis has serious repercussions that have compelled those countries  lacking in resources as they are  to review their development strategies.Thus Africa is in the throes of a particularly acute economic crisis exacerbated by the fall in raw-material prices. This situation  marked by a widening in the gap between industrialized and raw-material-exporting countries  was brought to the attention of the international community in 1986. A special session of the United Nations General Assembly was devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa. A year later  we may question the benefits of that session. Although the majority of African countries are embarked on a basic restructuring of their economies  the expected outside assistance has barely begun to trickle in. Together with the natural disasters that have stricken some African countries  efforts at restructuring  if not supported by a sizeable inflow of capital from outside  and especially from the developed countries  will be doomed to futility.Evidence of this is the fact that at present the African countries are experiencing greater outflows of capital than they are taking in. It goes without saying that repayment of principal and debt-servicing are in large part responsible for this imbalance that is so seriously affecting the growth policies of African countries. In addition  it would be highly desirable if concrete measures could be taken to find a solution to the debt problem. In addition to the serious economic problems  there are the armed conflicts that are delaying the progress of developing peoples. The conflicts shaking Africa and Asia  as well as Latin America  are also of concern to my delegation.With regard to the Middle East  Chad has always supported the Palestinian cause. At the Islamic summit meeting at Kuwait in January of this year. President Al-Hadj Hissein Habré stated; '""The Republic of Chad is at one with the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people  and we thus support the idea of an international conference to be held under the aegis of the United Nations.""However  we were astonished to learn that Palestinian brothers have been recruited  at considerable cost  to fight against the people of Chad in Chad'. Are we to understand that our Palestinian brothers have abandoned the liberation struggle of their own country  or are they merely giving in to the temptations of the international mercenary system?We would ask the same question of the Lebanese who have followed suit. Would those Lebanese not be better off striving to protect the unity and independence of their own country?In the Persian Gulf the war between two fraternal countries  Iraq and Iran  is continuing  in spite of the many appeals and efforts at mediation and in spite of Iraq's oft-repeated readiness to enter into dialogue. My delegation unreservedly supports the implementation of Security Council resolution 590 (1987)   unanimously adopted on 20 July 1987.The occupation of Afghanistan has been going on for eight years  in spite of the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from that country. Like any foreign occupation  this one has pernicious effects that often drive those concerned into exile. Chad  which has experienced Libyan occupation  can only express its total sympathy to the Afghan people in their struggle for national liberation. Africa remains infected by the odious apartheid system. The minority racist regime of South Africa continues to keep the black majority outside the management of the country's affairs and deprives it of"" all rights. That same policy has been extended to Namibia  where the fascist regime of Pretoria defies the United Nations by refusing to put an end to its occupation and apply Security Council resolution 435 (1978).To perpetuate its domination  the minority regime spares no effort to destabilize the front-line countries  which are the frequent victims of murderous South African raids conducted under the pretext that fighters from the liberation movements of southern Africa are harboured by those States.The liberation movements and the front-line States can rest assured of the firm support of Chad. My delegation reiterates the frequent appeals to South Africa to cease its incursions into the territories of the front-line States  withdraw unconditionally from Namibia and immediately start to set up a multiracial society in which all communities can participate on an equal basis in the management of the affairs of the State.The people of Democratic Kampuchea has suffered for many years from the horrors of a war of occupation imposed upon it by Viet Nam. My country  which has always supported the efforts of the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and those of the United Nations to ensure respect for the independence and sovereignty of Kampuchea  demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all occupation troops to enable the Kampuchean people freely to decide on its fate  under the direction of the legitimate Government  led by His Royal Highness Samdech Norodom Sihanouk.With regard to Central America  we encourage the peaceful initiatives of the Contadora Group and express the hope that the peace plan proposed by Mr. Oscar Arias Sanchez  President of the Republic of Costa Rica  will make it possible finally to find a lasting solution to the problems of the area.As everyone knows  peace has no price. It is  indeed  the fundamental condition of any social and economic progress. However  some States Members of our Organization like to create conflicts and exacerbate them to serve their diabolical plans for domination  well aware that they are violating the United Nations Charter  to which they have committed themselves.Chad believes in the virtues of dialogue and has never missed an opportunity to show this. It believes that the United Nations must be involved more deeply in the search for solutions to certain so-called regional conflicts. The United Nations would thus be working for peace and in favour of the law  in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter. In expressing the wish that States would act more in conformity with the principles of the Charter  which they accepted by becoming Members of the United Nations  the delegation of Chad reaffirms its full faith in the Organization and expresses the wish that this session will find the solutions so long desired for the problems which are a matter of such deep concern to us.: "
"134",6737,"TGO",42,1987,"﻿We are once again gathered here in the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations  where so many debates have been heard on the most pressing questions of stability  peace and security in our world.We are interrupted in our daily comforts by extremely grave images of suffering which regularly come to the fore from the four corners of the extended village our world has become  laying bare the desperation of millions of men  women and children who are deprived of the most basic requirements of life or of their legitimate tights as citizens.However  we must persevere in our faith in the future  which is what brings us h ere together. We must continue and intensify our actions in order to fashion our world to reflect the hopes of all peoples  which are still counting on the capacity of our Organization to lead them towards a future of peace  dignity and prosperity.I should like to say that my country is very much aware of our responsibilities once again to share in and promote the spirit of dialogue and harmony which imbues the work of this Assembly. Togo is unswervingly devoted to the noble ideals of the United Nations. Hence I am very pleased to bring you  Mr. President  and all the delegations present here the fraternal greetings and message of peace and solidarity of the people and the Government of Togo  as well as of His Excellency General Gnassingbe Eyadema  President and founder of the Rally of the Togolese People and President of our Republic.I am especially happy to express to you  Mr. President  the heartfelt congratulations of the Togolese delegation on your resounding election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Your competence and proven reputation as a skilful diplomat  as well as the sincere devotion of your country  the German Democratic Republic  to the ideals of international peace and co-operation made you a natural choice for this post. We are sure that as a result of this choice our work will be carried out harmoniously and successfully.May I also congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh  on the skill with which he led the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly and ensured its full success.I should like  through the Secretary-General  to hail the entire United Nations system for its prominent role in favour of peace  security and international development. We take comfort in seeing Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar once again carrying out his functions with his well-known devotion and calm determination. We should like to congratulate him on his timely and wise initiatives to give our Organization renewed energy capable of enhancing its credibility and effectiveness. In this regard the Togolese Government is following with deep interest his mediation efforts to resolve conflict situations.My delegation is particularly happy to find Ambassador Reed at your side  Mr. President  for he has gained the confidence and friendship of us all. We wish him full success in his new high functions.It has been unanimously agreed on the occasion of the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization that the United Nations remains the only world institution where there are discussions which  as repetitive as they may seem  awaken the conscience of world leaders on the choices that must be made and the urgent solutions that must be reached. It is that indispensable role of the United Nations which is the reason for our being here to seek solutions to the problems besetting the world. Indeed  it is very disturbing to note that  despite oft-repeated professions of faith in our declarations - which particularly characterized the last session devoted to the International Year of Peace - the world is hardly in better shape. Peace remains precarious. The obstacles in the way of negotiation and understanding among peoples are increasing  thus fomenting conflicts of all kinds.In the face of turbulence that at times shakes our faith in the future  the United Nations  because of its presence and permanence  is the embodiment of the triumph of reason over force  of intelligence over passions.But there is still a long way to go before reason can triumph over brute force in South Africa  where at the cost of much blood and untenable violence the majority of the population is kept under total domination by the white minority. The hopes raised last year by the great wave of protests against apartheid have waned today  given Pretoria's blind obstinacy. Africa for its part will never give up its struggle for dignity and freedom. Indeed  how can we allow a system to persist on part of our continent where the most basic civil rights are flouted because of skin colour. How can Africa  as declared by the President of the Togolese Republic  General Gnassingbe Eyadema ""resign itself to an unjust situation of oppression such as that now prevailing in this region  where a regime unworthy of mankind and our times and contrary to any and all morality  is maintained through unspeakable violence against a population whose only crime is the colour of its skin."" Par from giving up their inhuman system the defenders of this absurd concept of political society are stiffening their intransigence. The state of emergency declared last year to silence the protests and revolts is still in force  to the great misery of the black population. It is time that Pretoria unconditionally give up once and for all its infamous system of apartheid. This is a requirement of history. All peoples have a common destiny of freedom  and no form of oppression  whatever its violence and its duration  can halt their unstoppable march towards dignity. This is a lesson which is often forgotten  but which remains eternally valid.More than ever it is important for the international community to increase pressure by all available means. That is why  in order to support the resolutions of the General Assembly  the Security Council must adopt against South Africa the comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter  The Togolese Government reaffirms its full support for liberation movements  in particular  the African National Congress (ANC)  whose constant willingness to engage in dialogue has been proved. We pay tribute to Nelson Mandela  symbol of the determination of the black people to fight humiliation and to refuse to yield to despair. Namibia is still being occupied in violation of international law and United Nations resolutions  despite our proclamations and our warnings. The rigours imposed by apartheid and its excesses are still being suffered there. Pretoria is brazenly increasing the obstacles to implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (197Θ)  which prescribes the unconditional independence of the Territory. In specifically and abusively linking the withdrawal of its troops from Namibia to the withdrawal of the Cuban forces from Angola  the racist regime is resorting to diversion and scorning our resolutions in order to stalemate negotiations and perpetuate its illegal occupation of the Territory. The international community and the United Nations should use all means that could help bring South Africa to accept speedy implementation of resolution 435 (1978). For its part  Togo takes this opportunity to renew its firm support for the heroic struggle of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole  authentic representative of the Namibian people.We must do everything possible to halt the aggressions being arbitrarily unleashed against the civilian populations of the front-line countries  which are courageously serving as ramparts against injustice and racism. The Togolese Government hails the determination of the leaders and peoples of the front-line States who are opposing the violence and provocations of the South African army and the rebels taking orders from Pretoria.The situation in Chad is a legitimate subject of concern for us all. Twenty years of fratricidal war have exhausted that country and its fraternal people  who aspire to peace in union with their sons and families  with the integrity of their territory restored. Our country hails the desire for national reconciliation which has been affirmed there. Unity among all the people of Chad is indispensable in order to rebuild and guarantee the independence of their country  which should then at last be able to devote itself to the essential tasks of development. We are pleased to note that the parties to the conflict support the proposal of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for a cease-fire so that this dispute between them over the Aouzou Strip can be settled peacefully and definitively.In order to prevent a further deterioration of the situation  on 17 September last the political bureau of the Assembly of the Togolese people urged the parties to the conflict to abstain from the use of force and advocated the following three-point plan for the peaceful solution of the dispute: first  an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of all forces involved from the Aouzou Strip; secondly  dispatch into the field of a neutral intermediary force  whose composition would be determined by the two parties involved  and whose mission it would be to ensure respect for the cease-fire) and  finally  acceptance by both parties of arbitration by the International Court of Justice.In Western Sahara  the parties to the conflict have still not achieved a satisfactory agreement on the question of self-determination. We must continue to encourage all those who are trying to reconcile the various positions Involved  We hope that intransigence will give way to greater flexibility so that an agreement can be brought about as quickly as possible in accordance with resolution 104 of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and General Assembly resolution 4 0/50. We hail the unceasing efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Acting President of the OAU to find a just and equitable solution to this conflict.The war between Iraq and Iran is assuming unexpected dimensions that are greatly disturbing the entire international community. Indeed  recent developments in that conflict and the excessive concentration of military might in the small Gulf area indeed justify our fears. Indeed  all States that are truly aware of the gravity of the situation that has thus been brought about have greeted with relief the Security Council resolution directing Iraq and Iran to put an end to the hostilities  and we hope that that decision  which followed upon many appeals to the two belligerents  will be implemented so that the confrontation can be brought to an end in the interests of all. In this regard  the hopes raised by the recent peace missions of the Secretary-General to Iran and Iraq must not be disappointed.Lebanon is living through a situation of open and permanent warfare whose origins go far back in time. The Lebanese nation is slowly crumbling as a result of the cruel and implacable war  which is constantly escaping control and reason. No one can be indifferent to the Lebanese tragedy. The violence it is engendering poses a real threat to stability in the Middle East. We invite the parties to renew their dialogue so that they may achieve an agreement that would make it possible for that country to return to peace and stability. Peace should be the basic objective in dealing with this acute conflict  which has pitted Israel against the Arab countries for many years now. At the centre of this conflict there remains the painful Palestinian problem. My country supports the idea of an international conference that would bring together  under the auspices of the United Nations  all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). ¡Such a conference should find appropriate solutions to the problems facing the countries of the region.This year we again have on our agenda the painful problem of Kampuchea. My country has on several occasions expressed its position on the foreign domination to which that country is subjected. We feel that nothing justifies the occupation of a country by forces foreign to it. The eight-point proposal of the Tripartite Coalition led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk is conducive to making possible an agreement between the parties to the conflict. The United Nations should continue to support the Government of Democratic Kampuchea  and the Government of Togo wishes here and now to reaffirm its firm support for the people of Democratic Kampuchea in their struggle for territorial integrity and independence. Afghanistan  also  is a victim of the occupation of its territory by foreign troops  and that has forced its people to engage in armed resistance and exodus from the country. Togo hails the decision on the withdrawal of foreign troops and desires its effective implementation so that that country may be freed and its people may have the government of their choice free of foreign interference.The Korean war ended with the division into two parts of Korean territory. Today the Korean people  whose common destiny springs from geography  culture and thousands of years of shared history  is suffering as a result of that division. The international community should not be indifferent to that tragedy. It should support the three-point plan of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  implementation of which would culminate in the constitution of a Democratic Federal Republic of Korea  in which each of the two Koreas would have the regime of its choice pending final reunification. At the end of that process  Korea could be admitted to the United Nations as a single  United national entity. Any other solution would serve to perpetuate the present arbitrary division of the country. That is why we urge the international community and the United Nations to support the efforts to ensure reunification of the Korean homeland.In Central America hope is being reborn following the .agreement signed last August in Guatemala City by the five principal States of the region to bring about peace in that region. We hope that the parties concerned and all other interested parties will abstain from any measures that could disturb effective implementation of that agreement. My country would like to pay a tribute to President Arias Sanchez and to hail the exceptional contribution of Costa Rica as well as that of the Contadora group of countries to the restoration of peace in Central America.The persistence of these zones of tension make the vital need for world disarmament all the clearer to US  The accumulation of arms in the world maintains and increases the climate of distrust and suspicion which incites States to engage in the arms race. Only effective and complete disarmament will make it possible for all nations to live in peace. This objective requires the courage and objectivity of us all. The United Nations should therefore strengthen its powers of dissuasion and promote peaceful behaviour and a peaceful spirit among peoples and Governments. Individually and collectively  our States should work towards this objective. Our world is today at a crossroads and it must choose between continuing to arm and continuously endangering the human species and proceeding to general and complete disarmament  which would release new resources that could be used to improve the living conditions of our peoples.There is thus a real link between disarmament and development. The evidence for that link was clearly emphasized at the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which has just concluded its work. We hope that the efforts made in this connection will be pursued relentlessly  making it possible to determine the precise means by which resources released by disarmament will be reallocated to programmes for the economic  social and cultural development of our peoples.It is encouraging that since last year significant progress has been made in the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on nuclear disarmament. While we pay a tribute to those two great Powers for their courage  tenacity and sense of responsibility  we must say that their efforts should be increased and continued unceasingly and extended to all types of conventional  strategic and other weapons. We extend our warm congratulations to the Soviet Union and the United States for the important agreement on medium-range missiles which they have just concluded.It is the duty of all States  large or small  to participate in our Organization's efforts to bring about disarmament. That is why Togo is pleased to have on its soil the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa. My country has already concretely demonstrated its support for the Centre and will continue to support it to the best of its ability.Terrorism in its present manifestations is a permanent danger to peace and a constant threat to the foundations of the political organization of our societies. My country  Togo  twice the victim  in 1985 and in September 1986  of mindless  blind terrorism  feels that this is a scourge with which the international community must deal with all the vigilance and determination that it demands.In addition to the political problems which assail it  our world is also experiencing a tragic economic situation. Today the peoples' growth and development should be an objective of and a responsibility shared by all States. And here  as elsewhere  our ability to find appropriate solutions to the problems born of profound imbalances in international economic relations depends upon our understanding and our co-operation.It should be no surprise that I am beginning my statement on this subject with the critical economic situation in Africa  which is of the greatest possible concern to the Governments and peoples of the continent. This is- not the time to go at great length into Africa's economic situation; we have discussed that thoroughly  particularly during the special session which our Organization devoted to consideration of the question last year. However  I should like to recall that Africa is today the poorest continent on our planet. It accounts for the greatest number of least developed countries  and is exposed to such serious natural calamities as drought and desertification. Finally  it is a continent confronted by a continuing decrease in its export earnings and a considerable foreign debt the repayment of which heavily mortgages its development prospects. Africa has made enormous sacrifices to extricate itself from this tragic situation. It has begun structural adjustment programmes whose implementation has forced it to abandon many development projects. Many African countries have adopted economic recovery measures which had a considerable effect on the standard of living of their populations. However  those efforts have not attracted the support expected of the international community. In particular  the international community has not fulfilled its commitment to mobilize additional resources within the framework of the United Nations Programme for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa  adopted last year  in these conditions  it will soon be impossible for the African countries to make the additional sacrifices without seriously compromising social peace  stability and domestic security. That is why my country appeals urgently to the International community to respect its commitments and substantially increase its assistance to the African continent to enable it to overcome its difficulties with regard to economic and social development.The analysis of the present economic situation in Africa naturally leads us to consider the more general problem of the Indebtedness of the developing countries  and in particular that of the reduction of the prices of raw materials and  consequently  the deterioration in the terms of trade. These are questions which are inextricably linked and whose solution Is a challenge to our Imagination  innovative capacity and collective intelligence. It is a challenge that we must meet.To this end  the Organization of African unity (OAU) decided to devote a special session towards the end of this year to consideration of this question  which urgently requires solution. To reach such a solution it is clearly necessary to deal directly with the structural causes of indebtedness and especially with the factors that compromise the ability of the debtor countries to repay: namely  the erratic fluctuations in currency rates and increases in interest rates. These are undoubtedly some of the factors that explain the irresistible growth of debt despite the praiseworthy efforts of developing countries to honour their commitments. It is urgently necessary that effective measures be taken to alleviate countries' debt burden. In a spirit of responsibility and solidarity  agreements between debtors and creditors must lead to the revision of agreements and the application of Interest rates and repayment arrangements under very easy conditions. The pure  and simple cancellation of debts to which some creditor countries have kindly agreed is an Important step in the right direction. We wish once again to express our great gratitude to those countries for their gesture of solidarity and understanding.It is necessary also that developed countries do everything they can to achieve or even exceed as soon as possible the objective of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance. In the case of the least developed countries  this assistance should be increased to 1.5 per cent of the gross national product  or doubled  in accordance with the New Substantial Programme of Action for the 1980s. Official development assistance should not only increase In volume  but should be accompanied by favourable conditions  in particular symbolic Interest rates and sufficiently lengthy periods of grace and repayment.As regards the international economic environment  the recent Initiatives and studies undertaken by the international community have not been In keeping with the situation. This is true of the results of the summit meeting of the seven most industrialized countries held this year in Venice. Those countries expressed their desire to contribute to bringing about more balanced relations and greater solidarity between the industrialized countries and the third world  but the Venice conclusions did not respond to the expectations of the developing countries. This is also true  with regard to the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  held last July in Geneva  of which we had legitimate hopes. However  UNCTAD VII was not able to attack International economic problems with the necessary courage and political will. A difficult compromise was achieved on the items considered  but the many instances of reticence shown by some developed countries with regard to measures for restructuring the world economy constitute a source of major concern for the developing countries.Nevertheless  we reaffirm that UNCTAD  despite its present difficulties  should continue to be an organ of special importance for consideration  negotiation and decision in the area of international economic co-operation. In South-South co-operation  geographical distance should not be an insurmountable obstacle to the intensification of economic exchanges between developing countries. That has been reaffirmed twice this year - by the ministerial conference on economic co-operation between non-aligned countries  held at Pyongyang  and at the meeting on Africa's economic recovery  held at Abuja  the new capital of Nigeria. In this regard we roust evaluate all of the economic potential of the developing countries in order to benefit from the ways in which they complement one another.In so doing  we shall improve our opportunities further to develop fruitful relations capable of increasing our collective autonomy. Within this framework we should encourage attempts at economic integration being made in Latin America  Asia and Africa. In Africa  in particular  our countries are making sustained efforts  in implementation of the Lagos Plan of Action adopted in 1980 by the Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)   to draw their resources together and integrate their economies within sub regional organizations  pending the conclusion of the process of setting up a vast common market covering the continent.The United Nations was created because twice in one generation the whole world was shaken by a murderous  devastating war. Ending violence  maintaining and strengthening peace  and promoting economic and social development were the main goals that the founding fathers set for the Organization. All Member States  big and small  must make their contribution to the realization of those noble objectives and to the strengthening of the Organization. Let them  in a spirit of close solidarity  join their forces to struggle against the real and growing threats to their collective well-being and unite to establish a new world order in which all will derive the energy  and see the need  for building together a world more in accordance with the deep aspirations of the peoples to peace and justice.

"135",6783,"THA",42,1987,"﻿Permit me at the outset to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of Thailand and on my own behalf  the warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that your recognized qualities and experience will ensure that the Assembly's proceedings will be conducted with smooth efficiency  wisdom and fairness  and that we will achieve a successful conclusion.I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the outgoing President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly  who is a distinguished son of Bangladesh and Asia  for his invaluable contribution to the work of the Organization during the past year. In a world beset by a host of political and economic problems a nation's cohesiveness and resilience are of the utmost importance. The success of Thailand since the Second World War is a good example. In one way  the Thai experience is unique. We the Thai people have beenblessed with the Thai monarchy. This institution is at present personified by His Majesty King Bhuraibol Adulyadej  the ninth King of the House of Chakri. He has been and continues to be the central  unifying element of the Thai nationhood. He is the moral inspiration for our Government and people. He is the soul of our nation.In the next nine months two events of the greatest significance to the Thai nation will be celebrated. The first  in December  will be the sixtieth anniversary of His Majesty's birth  which  to the Thai people  marks one of the most important milestones in a person's lifetime. Then  next July  he will become the longest-reigning monarch in Thai history. The celebrations of those two events will provide the Thai people with opportunities to display their boundless respect  profound gratitude and immeasurable affection for their beloved monarch.As a working monarch in the national mainstream  our King has always been in close touch with the people. He has tirelessly and selflessly devoted himself to the progress and welfare of the people  especially those in rural areas. In these efforts he has always been assisted by Her Majesty the Queen and other members of the Royal Family.The Thai King believes that all his subjects have a right to share in the benefits of the nation's progress and prosperity. He has pioneered rural development projects designed to help the people fulfil their basic needs and achieve self-sufficiency. These projects have brought an increased measure of prosperity to the rural poor. Many of the projects have been funded from his own personal resources. He has also led in the search for a humane way to help the hill tribes abandon opium cultivation. He has initiated crop substitution and integrated development schemes. These have been carried out by my Government. As a consequence  the output of opium has been reduced significantly over the years.The international drug problem is of great concern to my country. For this reason we participated actively in the International Conference on Drug Abuse and illicit Trafficking at Vienna in June this year. The meeting  under the inspired presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia  was able to create a programme of action by Governments to cope with this global problem.The royal oath taken by Thai monarchs includes the vow to render aid and comfort to all in need. During the past 12 years Thailand  under the reign of King Bhumibol  has been recognized for its compassion to fellow human beings uprooted by war and oppression. Thailand has offered temporary shelter to nearly one million refugees. These are the Kampucheans  Laotians and Vietnamese who have fled into Thailand since 1975  and especially since the invasion of Kampuchea in 1978. Over 350 000 still remain. A major cause of this plight of such magnitude has been the aggression and occupation of Kampuchea by Vietnamese armed forces. This problem poses the major obstacle to peace and stability in the region. It is not only a threat to the security of Thailand and South-East Asia  but also an economic drain on Viet Nam1 s own resources and a waste of the assistance given to Viet Nam by its friends and allies. In addition it imposes a humanitarian burden on its neighbours and on the international community. Vietnamese deeds in Kampuchea violate the United Nations Charter and international law. For this reason  year after year the General Assembly has condemned Viet Nam's actions and demanded the total withdrawal of its forces from Kampuchea. The General Assembly has endorsed the Kampuchean people's right to self-determination and to choose its own Government without foreign interference. Over two thirds of the United Nations membership have also remained firm in their call for a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in Kampuchea. The future Kampuchea should be neutral and non-aligned and should pose no threat to any country.The countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will continue to work for such a settlement. Their latest effort was on 16 August 1987  when they endorsed the proposal that the Kampuchean factions engage in a dialogue with the Vietnamese at a gathering. This gathering is envisaged as an initial step towards the political settlement of the Kampuchean problem.Recent developments have indicated an increasing convergence towards a desire to bring about an end to the conflict in Kampuchea. We call on the leaders of Viet Nam to turn this desire into reality. Let them withdraw their forces from Kampuchea  as they have said they would  but let them do it now and not in 1990  as proclaimed.We agree that national reconciliation at an appropriate time is a prerequisite for a political solution. One personage who is vital to the Kampuchean drama is His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk. We believe that under his tutelage and leadership the Kampuchean people can heal their wounds and band together to bring about a rebirth of the Kampuchean nation.Thailand wishes to record its deep appreciation of the United Nations Secretary-General's devoted and tireless efforts to restore peace in Kampuchea. Ws urge him and the international community to intensify their efforts towards this end. In particular  Thailand calls on the major Powers  which wield great influence  to become even more conscious of this problem  which affects not only the Kampucheans but others as well. It is encouraging to observe that some of them have begun to discuss among themselves the way to resolve this question  as evidenced in the continuing series of dialogues between such major Powers as the United States  the Soviet Union and China. On several occasions Thailand has raised this matter with many international leaders and requested them to assist. It is iniquitous that this tragedy of untold suffering has been allowed to be prolonged. Actions leading to a just and lasting solution should and must be taken without undue delay. Everybody must lend a hand.Only after Kampuchea has regained its sovereignty and independence will that part of South-East Asia be able to turn swords into ploughshares. Only then will the countries of the area be able to reconstruct their shattered economies. Then  and only then  will their peoples be able to enjoy the benefits of peace that are taken for granted elsewhere. Then  too  will the rest of us in South-East Asia be able to realize our full potential as a part of the rapidly developing Pacific Basin. Together we can give meaning to Pacific dynamism  which can impart great benefit not only to this region but also to the world at large.The aspiration to achieve peace and prosperity through common efforts and co-operation finds good expression in the endeavours of ASEAN. This year has already witnessed the twentieth anniversary of the founding of ASEAN. The birth of ASEAN was indeed a major turning point in the history of South-East Asia  based as it is on shared interests and values  as well as pragmatism and tolerance. The concept o£ free association has thus made its mark in a region where colonialism ran rampant not so long ago. ASEAN co-operation has indeed stimulated regional growth and prosperity over much of the past two decades. ASEAN is scheduled to hold a few months from now its third summit meeting to chart the course of its peaceful and constructive co-operation for the next decade.In this regard  Thailand is pleased to learn of the agreement in principle between the Soviet Union and the United States on the elimination of intermediate and short-range missiles and of the forthcoming summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev. We hope that after this important beginning further efforts will be made to reduce the strategic missile arsenals by 50 per cent. Effective measures are also necessary in the fields of chemical and conventional weapons. In Africa  the Namibian people and the black majority in South Africa have been victims of unilateral oppression for generations. Thailand once again joins in the call for the eradication of the apartheid system and for the immediate implementation of the United Nations Plan for Namibia.The problems of the Middle East continue to be on the agenda of the world Organization. Thailand supports United Nations efforts to restore peace in the region on the basis of security for all States  withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories  self-determination for the Palestinian people  the territorial Integrity of Lebanon  cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq and withdrawal of forces to the International boundary. In the latter context  Thailand takes note of Security Council resolution 598 (1978)  which was adopted unanimously  and hopes that it will be fully Implemented.The situation in Afghanistan was caused by the single-minded pursuit of unilateral goals on the part of one of the world's most powerful nations. The problem can be resolved only on the basis of the relevant General Assembly resolutions  which demand the total withdrawal of foreign forces  and exercise by the Afghan people of their right to self-determination.The position of Thailand on these issues has been firm and consistent. Our position is based on the United Nations Charter and international law  and is in harmony with a majority of the Member States. The Secretary-General  too  enjoyed Thailand's confidence and support in his patient efforts to find peaceful solutions to these problems. My country is always willing to assist in these efforts  anytime  anywhere. Not all the urgent problems are of a political nature. Many of them are economic. The International economic system has created a web of interdependence. No nation stands alone. For this reason  Thailand is fully committed to an open and liberal world trade system. However some countries  particularly the more affluent  have adopted trade policies and measures which obstruct open and free international trade. Besides hindering the North-South dialogue  they also work against the interest of all nations. Developing countries with open economies  like Thailand  have already had to cope with the problems of low agricultural and commodity prices. These problems are compounded by protectionism against the export of products in which we enjoy inherent comparative advantages. Without the expansion of exports  we cannot sustain our economic growth. This would have major repercussions on our national development and on the well-being of our people. We therefore call on all countries concerned to show a sincere desire to co-operate. For only through such co-operation can we succeed in remedying the present international economic disorder.The most pressing problem of all time confronting any Government is the well-being of its people. Here  in the case of Thailand  the inspiration from our King has always been very important to my Government. As stated earlier. His Majesty has pioneered a great number of projects for the rural poor. Following his initiatives  my Government has allotted a major part of the national budget to development programmes for rural areas throughout the Kingdom.Despite the economic difficulties facing developing countries in the world ' today  Thailand continues to obtain substantial economic growth. Our rate of growth is estimated to be close to 6 per cent in real terms this year. This is due partly to the Government's success in providing incentives and in stimulating the economy. It is also due to the close co-ordination between the public sector and our private sector. We expect our economy to continue growing  which will in turn bring better health care  better food  better shelter and a better standard of living for our people. It is clear that  for Thailand  the role of the monarchy has proved to be indispensable. The monarchy is a moral force that binds all elements in the Thai nation. It is a force that works for the greatest good of the Thai people. As we in Thailand celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the birth of our King  we also see it as an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the cause of international peace  security and harmony. He are resolved to reaffirm our steadfast support for the United Nations. This is what the Ring himself stated in his royal address at the opening ceremony of the secretariat building of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific  in Bangkok  on 24 October 1975: ""The United Nations has set for itself the high ideals of maintaining international peace and security based on the principles of equality and friendly relations among all nations  and it has  in actual practice  always tried its utmost to co-ordinate and promote the efforts of large and small countries all over the world to create mutual understanding and co-operation in order to solve the various problems in economic  social  human rights and other fields."" The United Nations has indeed played a tremendously active role in bringing Member States together to solve international problems and crises. It must continue to champion the cause of international peace and security as well as the well-being of all the peoples of the world.The gathering of so many Heads of State and Heads of Government at the General Assembly each year testifies to the importance the world attaches to this Organization. But we hope that the fruits of the deliberations and discussions on these occasions will not leave only empty echoes of good intentions.Let us turn these good intentions into positive action  action which brings just solutions to our problems  action which brings real and beneficial changes to our world.If we do these things  then we will know that we have done our very best to create a better world for mankind."
"136",6899,"TTO",42,1987,"﻿My delegation extends to you  Mr. President  our heartiest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-second session. We have no doubt whatever that the conduct of the business of the Assembly is in capable hands. I wish also to express our deep appreciation of the firm and skilful manner in which Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury conducted the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.I have the honour to address this Assembly as head of the new Government which came peacefully and constitutionally to power by the will of the people  overwhelmingly expressed in a general election held in December 1986. A peaceful transition has taken place in my country after 30 years of unbroken rule by the previous regime. This has certainly been an extraordinary  if not an unparalleled  event. The mandate given to my Government in that election was reaffirmed only three weeks ago in another election at the local government level. The commitment of our people to government by consent of the governed is abiding and irrevocable.Nearly 30 years ago I attended the United Nations General Assembly for the first time as an observer and a member of Parliament. It was the year which witnessed the entry into the United Nations of an unprecedented number of new States. It was a time of great hope and promise in the decolonisation movement and of a remarkable upsurge of nationalism in what has since come to be known as the third world. It was the era of new  dynamic nationalist leaders whose ideas and personalities ignited the pride and aspirations of millions throughout the developing world.In the Caribbean we were at the time struggling to weld together a federal State out of ten separate territories with a population of about 5 million and forming an archipelago spread over 1 000 miles of sea  from Jamaica in the north to Trinidad and Tobago in the south. That ideal still remains a dream. Meanwhile  we have been seeking to define and redefine the meaning and limits of independence and sovereignty - not unlike the United Nations itself.We continue to face the contradiction between formal political independence and the reality of continued economic dependence. We contend with the psychology of dependence  sometimes reinforced by political oligarchies whose narrow interests are served by the time-worn strategy of divide-and-rule. We have come  through long and difficult years  to the hard-won understanding that co-operation among States enhances independence and does not detract from it. We have therefore been forging closer economic ties and have progressed from а free trade association to a common market  the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  serviced by a secretariat and a number of regional institutions. Apart from our institutional arrangements  we are in the process of building a network of relationships and contacts among each other at the level of private enterprise organizations  labour bodies and professional groups and associations  as well as intensifying our cultural and sporting contacts.The Government which I have the honour to lead is deeply committed to the ideal of regional unity. We have cultivated a closer relationship with other CARICOM leaders and have consciously adopted a CARICOM perspective in our dealings with the wider world. We applaud the move towards a political union within the Organization of Eastern Caribbean states  a sub grouping within CARICOM. It is by such incremental steps that we will move towards the realization of our inevitable Caribbean destiny.We in the Caribbean are the product of the cataclysmic historical forces that fashioned European  African and Asian civilizations. We are the triumphant survivors of the dehumanising horrors of slavery. We have been influenced and inspired by the great revolutions and liberation movements of Europe  America and the third world  whose themes have been the inalienable rights and the quintessential dignity of man. In the Caribbean we cherish passionately the concept of the dignity of the human being. If we oppose war  racism and the iniquitous system of apartheid  as well as terrorism and totalitarianism  if we struggle to eradicate poverty  famine and disease  it is because we consider them to be an offence to human dignity. The struggle against these forms of oppression is deeply rooted in our history. The Caribbean region has often been simplistically regarded as a historical backwater  a mere tourist destination whose main offerings are sea  sun and sand  yet the reality is that geographically  historically and culturally the region constitutes a link between North and South and East and West and has played - and continues to play - a part in world affairs out of all proportion to its size and population.We take pride in our intellectuals and artists who have become world figures - Marcus Garvey  C. L. R. James  George Padmore  Eric Williams  V. S. Naipaul  Derek Walcott  George Lamming  Arthur Lewis  to name but a few. Our sportsmen  particularly in the field of cricket  have written their names in international halls of fame.We have created the only new musical instrument of the twentieth century out of an industrial artefact  the steel oil drum. We have married it to our indigenous rhythms  the rhythms of carnival and calypso  and made it into a versatile instrument capable of rendering the most intricate musical compositions. Out of many transplanted peoples brought together to service the capitalist and plantation systems  a human phenomenon has evolved - a coexistence and intermingling of peoples of varied ethnicity  religion and culture with growing appreciation of the values of each other's culture and philosophy  and with increasing awareness of a shared identity of ideals.The peoples of the Caribbean form a virtual Diaspora of their own  and their culture has always exerted and continues to exert a subtle influence far beyond its boundaries. In reality  therefore  we are a crucible where a new civilization is taking shape. Compounded of the civilizations of Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas  Caribbean man is forever developing new and exciting variations of cultural synthesis.Our commitment to the brotherhood of man  our historical evolution and experience as a people determine decisively our attitude to world affairs. Hence our attitude  for example  to the system of apartheid practised in South Africa. We consider that system a heinous assault on human dignity. Its continued existence is a burning reproach to all of us here today  a blot of shame on our international community. Its perpetrators must understand that their conduct is repugnant and totally unacceptable to civilized humanity. There must be no accommodation with apartheid in South Africa.My Government will continue to interdict economic  cultural  sporting and other links with South Africa. At the international level  we will continue fully to support measures aimed at ending the apartheid system  including the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.We strongly condemn South Africa's acts of aggression against the front-line States  and the use of the illegally occupied Territory of Namibia as a platform for the launching of attacks. The sacrifices of the front-line States in the anti-apartheid struggles of the peoples of South Africa and Namibia are deserving of the maximum political and economic assistance by the international community.We invoke the support of the international community for the Namibian people in their just struggle for self-determination  freedom and genuine independence. Essential ingredients in any measures of support are  first  strict adherence to Decree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia  secondly  unswerving support for the universally accepted United Nations plan for Namibian independence contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978); thirdly  rejection of and dissociation from any illegally installed administration in the Territory? and  fourthly  the extension of sanctions adopted against South Africa  which must be mandatory and comprehensive.It is also of the utmost importance that this Organization closely monitor the situation in the other 17 countries on the United Nations list of Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories. The United Nations must seek to protect the rights  including the right to self-determination and independence  of the peoples of these dependencies. We must assist in ensuring that no policies or practices are adopted in these colonies that may eventually lead to heightened tensions and conflict in their post-independence period.I turn now to the situation in Central America. The Procedure for the Establishment of a Firm and Lasting Peace in Central America  signed by the Presidents of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua in Guatemala City on 7 August 1987  is a laudable attempt by the peoples of the region to solve their problems by a regional initiative. The Guatemala agreement is a delicate plant which will need careful and sensitive nurturing if it is to blossom as it can  into the enduring peace which the peoples of the region so deeply desire and need. The agreement responds to the historical imperatives of the region and reflects the ideals and inspiration of the great liberator  Simon Bolivar.It is also in the spirit of those ideals and aspirations that my Government looks forward to the early ratification of the amendment to the Charter of the Organization of American States  which would permit Belize and Guyana to take their rightful place in the family of American nations.Trinidad and Tobago is a proud member of that distinguished family. We value highly our links with the nations of Latin America and the wider Caribbean with which we share common traditions  common origins and common interests. And we shall work towards a strengthening of these bonds in the years to come.I turn now to the situation in the Middle East. Permit me to congratulate the Secretary-General on his dedicated efforts  with the full backing of the Security Council  to bring about an end to the conflict between Iran and Iraq. We trust that these efforts will be rewarded with an early peace. We are also painfully aware that problems of equal gravity remain  and I refer  in particular  to the Palestinian question  the resolution of which is fundamental to peace in the area.In this connection  we endorse the proposal for an international peace conference on the Middle East. We also urge an intensification of the search for a just and lasting peace which recognizes the rights of all States in the region to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and which guarantees a homeland for the Palestinian people.It is not only in the Middle East where problems afflict us. Throughout the world there are areas of conflict which must be satisfactorily resolved. I recognize that the task will be a long and difficult one  but it is one we ignore only at the risk of continued global instability and disorder. The issue of nuclear disarmament continues to be a source of great concern to the international community. All nations  large and small  developed and developing  would be affected by the consequences of a nuclear conflagration. For this reason  we will continue to voice out deep disquiet and apprehension over the spiralling arms race and to highlight the dangers of nuclear arsenals which  in the final analysis  add to a sense of insecurity among peoples throughout the world.We welcome the recent agreement in principle entered into between the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of intermediate range nuclear missiles. It is a development of the first importance and engenders optimism for the future. The leaders of both countries merit our warmest congratulations on this historic step. It is becoming increasingly apparent that threats to security are not only military in nature. My Government shares the views of those who recognize the importance of social and economic development as a stabilizing factor in the quest for security. From its inception the United Nations recognized disarmament and development as two of the fundamental issues facing the world community· The recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development not only reaffirmed the validity of this perception  out also underscored the profound linkages between these two most urgent challenges of our times.Reduced spending on arms by the industrialized nations can result in the release of enormous financial resources for development. We of the developing world ourselves  however  also have a responsibility in this process to reduce spending on armaments. Too many of our developing nations expend inordinate amounts of scarce financial resources on increasingly sophisticated weapons. These acquisitions very often tend to disturb regional balances and to aggravate tensions  leading to the perceived need for more and more weapons and to the negation of efforts to attain the desired goals- Every effort must be made to break this vicious circle. Its cost in human  material and financial resources is unacceptable-I turn now to the global economic and financial situation. Most developing countries have experienced in the 1980s sharp economic and social decline. The world economy has grown but slowly and  in the process  the benefits have accrued largely to the developed countries  with the result that the gap between developed and developing countries continues to widen. For the countries of the developing world the major constraints inhibiting growth and development have been chronically low commodity prices  difficulties in securing financing for productive investments  the imposition of trade barriers which restrict access to export markets  and the burden of servicing a tremendous external debt. These influences on the world economy must be addressed if we are to avoid in the 1990s the hardship and wasted opportunities of the 1900s. The new international economic order  which was conceived as a vehicle for promoting a more equitable distribution of global wealth and resources between developed and developing countries  has continued to elude us. The fundamental rules of the existing international economic system are still determined by a few wealthy nations and weighted against the economic aspirations of developing countries. Many States advocate a free and open trading system  but too often words are not matched by the necessary action to encourage access to domestic markets. We cannot overemphasize the fact that measures to facilitate trade remain a vital requirement for redressing the imbalances in the flow of resources. My Government consequently welcomes the decision taken last year at Punta del Este to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations within the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This decision provides the international community with an opportunity to tackle  and resolve  the problem of the many impediments in the international trading system.The need to facilitate capital flows to developing countries must also be urgently addressed. Concessional assistance has stagnated and the international commercial banking sector  stunned by the debt crisis  has moved swiftly to withdraw and to reduce its exposure in developing countries. In addition  countries like Trinidad and Tobago are denied access to resources solely on the basis of the criterion of per capita gross national product. Such decisions lack sensitivity to changing situations and to the negative effects of declining national income  particularly on vulnerable groups. Decision-making by multilateral institutions should surely take into account a wider range of economic and social factors. It has now come to be accepted that structural adjustment is an imperative for developing countries during this period. Structural adjustment must  however  be regarded as only one aspect of a meaningful  growth-oriented process. Multilateral financial institutions  particularly the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  which have been the main proponents of such policies  should be afforded the necessary resources for an expanded and supportive role in this process. Their impact on an expanding world economy can be enhanced only if they are provided with a larger capital base and allowed more flexible and innovative approaches.The debt problem has largely been met with a series of uncoordinated responses determined out of frustration and anxiety. Debtors are thus caught on a treadmill of debt-servicing and rescheduling and have in fact become net exporters of capital. The perverse situation in which developing capital-deficient countries are forced to be net suppliers of capital is neither acceptable nor sustainable.We owe it to our peoples  which hopefully follow our deliberations  to search for and find new and imaginative responses to this crisis- We believe that the agreements struck at the recently concluded seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will provide a basis on which we could build and advance. We emphasize that solutions to the problem must be based on the acceptance of shared responsibility between debtors and creditors. We support the several positive proposals put forward to that end at the recent joint meetings of the Bank and Fund in Washington.We of the developing world need not wring our hands in despair or be mere passive observers of international economic interaction. It is incumbent upon us  as developing countries  to take bold and decisive steps to improve our performance and economic structures  and to make them more efficient and responsive to the goals and aspirations of our peoples. Several of our countries are doing exactly that. Collectively  the countries of the South must awaken to our vast potential and diverse strengths. These must not be squandered but harnessed in our striving for development. Joint action by the international community  however  is the inescapable imperative for our continued existence on this planet.We the Members of this body are committed by our Charter to work towards a world in which nations coexist in peace based on respect for law and justice. If the measure of a State's ability to make a significant contribution towards this end is the extent of its coercive power  then we in the Caribbean are indeed irrelevant to the deliberations of the Assembly. But we do not hold that power can be so narrowly defined or that international affairs can be conducted on the basis that might is right.It is the cause of man  the cause of human dignity  for which we plead. It is for this reason that we remain committed to the community of the United Nations; because it is here that the weak  the poor  the oppressed  the hungry millions who form the majority of the peoples of this earth  can find a voice and receive a hearing among the leaders of the world. And I am confident that their voices will be heard."
"137",6945,"TUN",42,1987,"﻿It gives me great pleasure to convey to the President the congratulations of the Tunisian delegation on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We are confident that  given his well-known experience and skill  he will conduct the proceedings at this important session with the utmost efficiency. I can assure him of Tunisia's co-operation with his country  the German Democratic Republic. Our two countries have always maintained excellent relations of friendship and co-operation.I am also happy to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  who presided tactfully and effectively over the work of the forty-first session. Our deep appreciation and sincere gratitude go to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his dedication and for his eminently active role in the service of the Organization and in pursuance of the noble objectives of its Charter.In mounting this rostrum  from which the world's conscience is periodically expressed  sometimes in anguish and sometimes inspired by hope  I venture to request attention so that I may enumerate a distressing series of problems that have often been raised in this prestigious forum. I have  frankly  felt tempted to limit this statement to making a strong appeal for a radical change in all of us. Namely that in our deliberations we set aside individual problems and current differences and - in our thinking  in our statements and in the formulation of our resolutions - acknowledge the absolute primacy of a common creed based on the Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the United Nations. For it is time - I might say it is high time - to enforce compliance with those two instruments  which are not impractical products of man's idle invention but.Indeed  irrefutable commandments and fundamental precepts that govern the conduct of each and every one of us.It is indeed high time for States in their relations to eschew their obsession with issues deriving from dogmatic allegiance and with conventional rifts that result from a kind of short-sightedness in the evaluation of International relations.It is time for us to join together in exorcising the demons of aggressiveness  hegemonism and tyrannical power so that mankind can finally live in peace and the peoples of the world can prosper through exchanges founded on fraternal relations.I would have liked to conclude by saying that  but this session has begun at a particularly critical time. The world is going through a period of turmoil  and the direst threats are gathering momentum in more than one region of our planet.In addition to the long-standing conflicts that have preoccupied the Organization almost since its Inception  such as the problems of the Middle East and southern Africa; in addition to the serious problems afflicting Asia  where both Afghanistan and Kampuchea are still occupied by foreign armies  and in addition to the convulsions in Central America  we now have a protracted war in a particularly sensitive region  which compounds the frustrations of the peoples of the Middle East  who have contributed so much to the development of civilization. I refer to the war between Iran and Iraq. That war is sapping the strength and potential of two fraternal peoples and may even jeopardize the future of those two great countries.All our efforts should be directed towards bringing that tragedy to an end·It is urgently necessary to establish a just peace  with no victor and no vanquished in order to terminate that particularly lethal and unjust conflict  a conflict that is all the more unjust as it involves two nations whose confrontation violates the very concepts of their traditional faith the Islamic religion  which preaches peace  brotherhood and tolerance for all mankind. The resolution adopted by the Security Council concerning the war between Iran and Iraq seems to us to offer hope by the very fact that it appropriately strengthens the role assigned to the United Nations in Chapter vu of the Charter. By assuming the task Incumbent upon it  our Organization can and must enforce solutions wherever peace Is threatened.The authority of the United Nations must be the guarantee of law and peace. That is my country's position  Tunisia  inspired by Bourguiba  a champion of peace and the brotherhood of peoples  has solemnly vested supreme authority in international legality and the world conscience· That authority is in perfect concord with the authority deriving from the spiritual values bequeathed by the Islamic message  to which ray country  while welcoming dialogue and keeping pace with progress  remains absolutely faithful.I must express my sorrow at seeing the Islamic message perverted and bereft of its real meaning because of some individuals and some terrorist organizations deceitfully arrogating to themselves a mission of redemption while actually furthering their own political ends or unleashing a fanaticism foreign to the real meaning of that message of Islam.Unfortunately this has been turned to their own account by the disparagers of Islam. Thus  a whole campaign of propaganda has been mounted against the sacred tenets and culture of Islam  propaganda that is sometimes based on ill will but most often on ignorance. In this all-embracing world of ours  how can we refuse to recognize the plurality of cultures  their originality  their message  their own dynamism and their evolutionary processes? In fact  the self-styled dominant cultures and civilizations simply reject what  through ignorance  they fail to understand. Let us therefore face up to the vital necessity  in an international community that has become one and indivisible  of dialogue between cultures and civilizations.There is certainly one country which in its life  history and institutions has given us an example of such a dialogue  a country which is today enduring a tragedy that envelops its territory  its identity and its very existence  a country which certainly does not deserve such a fate - namely  Lebanon. No one with any sense of justice or respect for human values can ignore a cry that arises from the depths of his conscience  a cry that betokens his sorrow  indignation and  above all  his solidarity. Without claiming to solve the world's problems it must be said that  by its history and geography  its culture and economy  and inspired by its universalist vocation  Tunisia is deeply sensitive to all the upheavals convulsing our modern world. Being both African and Arab  both Islamic and Mediterranean  Tunisia is situated at the crossroads of all the currents and turmoil that afflict the international community.That is why President Bourguiba  the founder of modern Tunisia  as a profound peace-loving man  has always given priority and deep thought to all the problems that have persistently beset the region.As regards one of the problems that is most difficult and important because of its historical and strategic implications  namely  the Middle East problem  ever since 1965 President Bourguiba has advocated recognition  as is now desired by all  of both the Palestinians and the Israelis  rejecting the racial confrontation aspect of this tragedy of historical  strategic and cultural-social dimensions.It is now essential for all of us to acknowledge the cogency of this approach  and the Arab countries  for their part  endorsed if not the letter at least the spirit of this approach in the Fez plan  which they adopted virtually unanimously in 1982 and which constitutes a realistic basis for solving the Middle East problem and especially that which lies at its very heart  the Palestinian problem·We are all aware  however  that for so long as Israel refuses to recognize the Palestinian personality and its right to self-determination and independence all efforts to reach a peaceful solution are doomed to failure. It takes two to negotiate and reach agreement. Fortunately  voices are now being raised in that country in favour of recognizing the Palestinian fact# which is an irrefutable reality. There is no doubt that if Israel's allies were themselves to accept this fact the international conference which we so earnestly advocate not only could be convened but would lead to the desired results. We hope that the efforts made in this direction by the Secretary-General will be successfully pursued so that the triple message of the one and only God  invoking peace and brotherhood  may once again resound from Jerusalem. Then  and only then  will genuine co-operation among all the countries of that region so crucial for the world  namely  the Mediterranean  be established.It is always with a sort of nostalgia for the past that people speak of the Mediterranean region  overlooking the fact that even today it is the principle area in which almost all dilemmas are concentrated - and sometimes confront each other. Alas  it is precisely there that the problems and contradictions of East-West and North-South relations intersect. The establishment of peace in this region of exceptional geostrategic importance would constitute an incomparable foundation for building a more brotherly  more interdependent world.The active participation of the great Powers in a conference on the Middle East could only help to further the necessary solutions and compromises. Moreover  they would be giving not only their own direct endorsement but also that of the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole.It is the Security Council that must at all times be the overseer of efforts to solve all the serious conflicts that threaten international peace and security.We shall not resort to an apocalyptic view of the future of our planet  where problems are indeed world-wide in scope. Rather  we shall strive confidently to emphasize the many signs and glimmers of hope that appear here and there. Today we are relieved - and this feeling has been confirmed by the statements we have heard - to catch a glimpse of the possibility of a return to more harmonious relations between East and West# which holds out the promise of a slowing down of the armaments race  in other words the beginning of real nuclear disarmament and above all the hope of seeing West and East helping to solve the vital problem of peace in all regions of the world.Indeed such concord would among other benefits open the way for the normal operation of the Security Council the only organ capable of eliminating the many disputes that are decimating the peoples of the third world in the Middle East Africa  Asia and Latin America.Thus in the efforts to ensure fulfilment of the legitimate aspirations of southern Africa the Security Council has already made a major indeed decisive  contribution by adopting resolution 435 (1978)  on Namibia. This is the only way to bring about the solution of that problem for which the United Nations will continue to bear particular responsibility until the total independence of that country. Whether Namibia or apartheid is at issue  it is also high time for the will of the Security Council - as I have already said - to become  for everyone  an incontestable rule of conduct for our countries in their international relations in a world that is at last banishing recourse to force and aggression. The sufferings inflicted by the apartheid regime on the black people of South Africa will not crush its heroic struggle for liberation. Given South Africa's refusal to compromise either on Namibia or on apartheid  the Security Council must impose the requisite mandatory global sanctions in order to stop the massacre of populations whose only crime is that they aspire to liberty. It is in the light of this problem and of all the other problems confronting mankind that we judge the scope and nobility of the role of the United Nations.We are therefore fully confident that the Security Council will fulfil its responsibilities under the Charter.Convinced as we are that grave dangers and perils threaten our world  we would like to believe that we are witnessing the dawn of a general awareness of the major problems of our time  be they political  economic or humanitarian.Accordingly  only the resumption of a serious  in-depth North-South dialogue inspired by our faith in the natural interdependence of peoples - in a community in which differences in the choice of ways of life cannot override strictly human aspirations and problems - can rescue us from the economic  financial and social anarchy characteristic of our present era  an era that is marked everywhere by the resurgence of poverty and violence  by persistent and spreading unemployment and by the irresponsible destruction of our environment.There is a major problem that persists in the minds of the international community. Because of its universal and lethal character  it must continue to engage the serious attention of our forums: I refer to the problem of international terrorism and the taking of innocent people as hostages. These attacks on people's safety and dignity constitute a challenge that outrages the human conscience. This form of violence  particularly odious because it is carried out in a blind and craven manner  is perpetrated indiscriminately against innocent victims who  by chance or coincidence  happen to be in the path of the killers or their bombs.Tunisia proclaims once again its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and reaffirms its intention and determination to work for the enforcement of measures proposed by the General Assembly and of all other ways and means of putting a stop to this terrible scourge.The deterioration in the sense of humanity in countries where the need has not arisen  the frustrations generated by the situation in the Middle East  the persistence of white segregationist domination over the peoples of South Africa and Namibia  and the armed conflicts in Asia and Latin America all contribute to a distressing picture of world-wide anarchy and disorder  which is only intensified by the armaments race  the economic crisis  monetary instability and the rapid decay of the environment.Political crisis  economic crisis  social crisis - actually we are witnessing a crisis of civilization in a world that prodigious scientific and technical advances have enfolded into a single network of interacting and interdependent influences.It is incumbent on the international community  which now constitutes an indivisible whole  to face up to the mounting perils created by many tensions  which are  for the most part  attributable to causalities and disparities often inherited from the colonial past. It is for us to eliminate the terrible anachronisms which  at the end of the present millennium  are represented by famine  poverty and sickness  mass unemployment and destruction of ecosystems which ravage the countries of the South by instituting in their stead a new world economic order capable of ensuring the viability  peace and security of our planet and by creating decent living conditions for the populations of the developing countries.Tunisia  like so many developing countries and so many sister countries of Africa  has agreed to make considerable sacrifices  inter alia  in the context of a thorough structural and global economic reform  being aware of the responsibilities incumbent upon it as a full member of the world economic system.In spite of these efforts and owing to the lack of substantial support on the part of their partners  the economic and financial situation of the vast majority of developing countries has now passed the critical point and continues to deteriorate  in particular in the most vulnerable countries.The extremely serious problem of the developing countries  external debt and the mounting flow of capital from our countries to the developed countries clearly illustrate the unacceptable and suicidal perversion of the world economy. Current debt management would actually only contribute to a dangerous increase in economic  political and social pressures on the world system as a whole. Nevertheless we continue to nourish the hope that the North-South dialogue  which was finally resumed at the last session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  will be strengthened by addressing all questions relating to development and growth and will co-ordinate the action of the Organization itself with the action of all bodies making up the United Nations system  for development must not remain a challenge or a mere  albeit fervent  aspiration. It must become a wish and a reality. The economic  monetary  trade and financial problems facing mankind as a whole have never been so great and never before have so many people  with the world population explosion  aspired to a better life.Never have the differences between the communities of our world and within these communities been so shocking and inadmissible as they are today.Perhaps there is no instant cure or magic solution for the present tragedy of the current rapidly worsening Imbalance between the overfed minority of humanity  living in superabundance and waste  on the one hand  and the majority  living in malnutrition and deprivation  on the other hand. Moreover  one cannot remain indifferent to the resources and sums of money expended on armaments when famine is ravaging millions of people and threatening millions more.These are the main concerns that Tunisia wishes to share with the international community. There are others  more directly and more specifically relevant to our country  such as the Western Sahara conflict  which constitutes a major obstacle to the progress of the people of our region towards realizing their aspirations to form a Maghreb community.Such a formation is certainly in the nature of things  but it has become more necessary than ever because of the close proximity of one of the world's greatest economic groupings  are which embraces all the traditional economic partners of the countries of our region within the European economic communities.This indicates how extremely urgent our crucial and vital need has become to co-operate with this strong European entity because of the added power that we would acquire from the formation of a Maghreb economic community based on the planning of our industrial projects and on the smooth operation of our economic structure. It explains the importance we attach to seeing the obstacle of the Western Sahara problem removed once and for all  so that our community can develop and assume the leading role that is expected of it  especially by Africa and the Arab world. We are particularly indebted to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuelar  for his persevering and imaginative efforts to find a solution to this thorny question. We consider that these worthy efforts are justified by the importance of what is at stake. By resolving the crisis and clearing the way for setting up a coherent and homogeneous Maghreb community  the Secretary-General will have helped to introduce an element of equilibrium  of political  economic and strategic stability  of co-operation and of prosperity into three regions of the world at present in deep distress: Africa  the Arab world and the Mediterranean.It is  nevertheless  a fact that the whole world - not to say the universe - is confused and threatened by a destructive lack of order.Never before has man been  thanks to scientific progress and the development of prodigious technologies  so powerful in the material sense. Never before  however  has he been so vulnerable and helpless  like the sorcerer's apprentice  overwhelmed by the forces  energies  weapons and achievements of his own creation  whose technologies he masters so well but which he uses so badly. For we know that science without conscience is soul-destroying.It is  however  striking that the future is every day becoming a more shared future  in a world where pollution for some people generates sickness for others  where war directly involving some people may lead to death and desolation for everyone else  but where the advancement  enrichment and abundance of some people have not  unfortunately  led to prosperity for all. Thus  if we want peace  security and development to be more than a mere slogan  we must all accept the comprehensiveness and interdependence of our responsibilities  so that we can join together in building a future that is no longer conceived and achieved in fear and anxiety  but is based on a fervent and irrepressible zest for life and hope.With respect for human rights  and unfailingly inspired by the Charter  we shall turn that hope into reality and life will thus fully enjoy the values given it by the Creator."
"138",6992,"TUR",42,1987,"﻿I take pleasure  Sir  in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. I wish you every success in discharging this important task. Our goal should be a constructive session where moderation will prevail. I am confident that you will guide the work of the General Assembly with diligence and skill towards that goal. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the President of the forty-first session  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh. During the last session important decisions were reached  in particular on the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations. Mr. Choudhury personally contributed to the achievement of agreement on this vital issue  and the General Assembly was able under his guidance  to function effectively despite the constraints arising from the financial situation of the Organization.I would equally like to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General. The United Nations and the Members of the Organization have continued to benefit from his dedicated efforts on a wide range of international issues. I reiterate our confidence in him to promote greater international understanding and harmony.The tasks of preserving peace  resolving international problems  strengthening international security for all and creating a more equitable economic environment continue to challenge our nations and Governments. Increased confidence-building and international co-operation ate the key to dealing effectively with many of those challenges.Prom our vantage point between the continents of Europe and Asia we have always appreciated the value of and given firm support to the efforts towards stabilizing and improving East-West relations. Mindful of our geographic location  we have supported in the field of arms control and disarmament those initiative that have a chance of being translated into concrete  balanced and verifiable measures without diminishing the individual or collective security of any count or group of countries. These considerations will continue to shape our approach to disarmament questions. We are pleased to note that there are at present new opportunities for genuine progress in East-West relations. Important steps have already been taken on the difficult road towards arms control and disarmament.We welcome the agreement in principle reached between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of all their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles. We have always supported the idea of the complete elimination of medium-range nuclear forces through the global application of the so-called double zero option. The agreement will go down in history as a major step forward  since it will entail meaningful and reciprocal reductions in the nuclear forces of the two major Powers for the first time in the nuclear age. Chancellor Kohl's declaration on the Pershing la missiles is an important and constructive step that facilitates that agreement. It is our hope that this agreement will pave the way for a treaty at the level of strategic weapons. The momentum that currently exists in the arms-control field must not be allowed to ebb away.We believe that arms-control efforts should be considered as an integrated whole in all its dimensions  be they nuclear  chemical or conventional. An agreement on medium-range nuclear forces in Europe will accentuate the urgent need to address the question of conventional forces in a meaningful way. It is not possible to deal with nuclear weapons In isolation if we are seeking enhanced security. If there is no progress in the near future in the area of conventional arms control  further reductions in nuclear forces may Indeed prove to be very difficult to achieve.There is a pressing need to establish a conventional balance in Europe at the lowest level possible  from the Atlantic to the Urals. Turkey participates actively in the negotiations to this effect currently under way in Vienna. I wish also to stress  as we have done in previous years  the growing urgency of concluding an international convention on the general and complete prohibition world-wide of chemical weapons and on the destruction of existing stockpiles.The success of arms-control initiatives depends in the first instance on the establishment of an environment of confidence among the parties concerned. In this connection I would underline the importance of the Helsinki process  which has contributed to bringing about an environment in Europe through which unprecedented progress in nuclear-arms reductions has come within the reach of mankind. All three dimensions of the Helsinki process  which deal  respectively  with security  economic relations and humanitarian issues  are of equal importance for the establishment of mutual confidence and fruitful co-operation in Europe.During the past year  as the attention of the international community has focused ever more on the continuing war between Iran and Iraq and the situation in the Gulf  that tragic conflict has caused further devastation and suffering  and I poses a growing threat to regional and international peace and security.We are deeply concerned by this situation. We maintain the hope that resolution 598 (1987) will provide a suitable basis for both countries to bring the war to an end. We hope that the Secretary-General's contacts in the region will contribute in concrete terms of the peace process  since the outbreak of hostilities between our two neighbours we have maintained friendly relations based on mutual confidence with both parties  while remaining strictly neutral. We believe that we can contribute to the peace process. The escalation in the Gulf and the tensions that have arisen in the region have further complicated the situation. In this respect  we have been trying to eliminate the misunderstanding caused by a lack of communication and to maintain a dialogue among the countries concerned. We remain ready to do everything in our power to be of assistance in this respect  while pursuing our friendly relations with all sides. In the Middle East  the Arab-Israeli conflict still awaits a just and lasting solution. There Is a definite need to reactivate the search for peace. During the past year the idea of an international conference has gained ground. Turkey supports all initiatives which might lead to a just and lasting peace. Representation of the Palestinians in such a conference is an important issue. The views of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people should also be given due consideration in this regard.We continue to support full recognition of the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people and the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories under Its occupation since 1967  including Jerusalem. The ultimate aim should be a just and lasting settlement which would create the conditions whereby all the nations of the region can live in peace and prosperity within secure and recognized borders. Economic co-operation among the countries of the region and projects serving common interests could increase confidence among the peoples of the region. That is our vision and that is why we have been working and consulting on an economic venture that will take the abundant waters of two rivers in Turkey as far south as to Saudi Arabia.The situation in Lebanon continues to be a source of serious concern and sorrow. The tragic developments of recent years lead us to reaffirm once again our conviction that only national reconciliation will enable the people of Lebanon to address all its problems successfully.The apartheid policies of the Pretoria Government have continued to be the principal cause of tension and violence in southern Africa. Since last year  unfortunately  the political situation in South Africa has not improved. The policy of the Turkish Government on this problem remains unchanged: so long as the South African Government does not totally abolish its policy of apartheid and embark upon a real process of dialogue and change  the international community should persevere in its efforts. The worsening of the situation in South Africa and the continued human suffering created by apartheid require more than ever a firm reaction on the part of the United Nations.The Council for Namibia   of which Turkey was a founding member  has this year marked the twentieth year of its establishment in 1967 as the legal Administering Authority for the Territory until it attains independence. It is a matter of the deepest regret that after so many years the Namibians have not been able to exercise their right to self-determination and that the United Nations plan for the Independence of Namibia  embodied in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  has remained un implemented. We reaffirm our full solidarity with the people of Namibia and our determination to continue to support their legitimate struggle for independence under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  The immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which was adopted unanimously  constitutes therefore the only universally acceptable basis for a peaceful solution to the Namibian question.The threat posed by terrorism to every society and to all facets of international relations has not abated. On the contrary  acts  methods and practices of terrorism which were unequivocally condemned by the General Assembly two years ago have continued to claim innocent lives on an increasing scale. Turkey has for many years stressed the necessity of effective international co-operation against terrorism in all its forms  we shall work with other Members for a forceful new resolution on terrorism which reaffirms resolution 40/61 of 9 December 1985  Those who instigate or support terrorist activities with the intention of jeopardizing the territorial integrity and security of other States assume a grave responsibility and should be unequivocally condemned by the international community. There can be no double standards about terrorism. Attempts to differentiate between various forms of terrorism can only encourage new acts of outrage. Those who support or tolerate terrorism for political advantage will only live to regret their short-sightedness.In the current year  there is no doubt that the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Traffic convened at Vienna in June was a timely initiative. We welcome all United Nations efforts directed towards assuring greater control over the drug problem  reducing the illicit drug trade  and at the same time alleviating the damage it causes to individuals and societies. As we stated at the International Conference  the close links between the illicit traffic in drugs and both organized crime and international terrorism constitute a serious and increasing threat to social stability and therefore necessitate concerted efforts by the international community to combat those scourges. The Turkish approach to the Cyprus problem is realistic and constructive. In fact that the Turkish Cypriot side has accepted the Secretary-General's draft framework agreement of 29 Match 1986  presented after comprehensive and arduous consultations with the parties concerned  is another indication of this constructive attitude. It is regrettable that the Greek side seeks to prolong the dispute and pursue confrontation rather than accept the Secretary-General's draft framework agreement as the basis of a negotiated settlement. The Greek Cypriot efforts to blame the party that has accepted the Secretary-General's draft for the present stalemate constitute a manifest contradiction. By the same token  the Greek Cypriot efforts in international forums where the Turkish Cypriot people are not represented will certainly not be conducive to a settlement of the dispute. The Greek Cypriot initiative to open a debate on the Cyprus problem during the present session is yet another example of its efforts to divert attention from its intransigence. Past experience has shown that such initiatives render the problem all the more complicated and difficult to solve.The Members of the United Nations are aware of our deep humanitarian concern over the plight of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria  a minority of one and a half million people whose status and rights are unequivocally recognized by bilateral and international agreements. We regret that the Bulgarian Government continues with its coercive policy of assimilating that community  denying its identity and its most elementary human rights. Bulgaria also denies its members the right of emigration. We are ready to accept all who wish to immigrate to Turkey. Many countries and organizations have appealed to the Bulgarian Government to abandon this policy of oppression and to restore the minority rights of the Turkish Muslin community. In fact  if the Bulgarian Government adopted a positive attitude in this regard  that would bring about progress in our bilateral relations  improve the prospects of Balkan co-operation  and reinforce the Helsinki process with regard to the application of its humanitarian principles.With regard to Afghanistan  we continue to support the efforts made by the Secretary-General and his representative to help work out a political solution  regret that the latest round of proximity talks held at Geneva has been inconclusive and that it has not yet been possible to surmount the remaining difficulties on the way to a comprehensive settlement. We strongly believe that the diplomatic process must be pursued and that Afghanistan must be allowed and assisted to become once again a truly independent country. In this connection we should like to reiterate our deep appreciation of the humanitarian assistance provided by the Government and people of Pakistan in hosting millions of Afghan refugees.The prevailing tensions in South-East Asia and the plight of the Kampuchean people continue to be a cause of concern. The key to a just and lasting political settlement in Kampuchea continues to be the exercise by the Kampuchean people of their inalienable right to self-determination. We consider the eight-point proposal made by the Coalition Government on 17 March 1986 and supported by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to be a valid framework for a comprehensive political settlement. We also believe that the recent efforts of the countries of ASEAN and the Secretary-General represent a constructive contributor to the search for a peaceful settlement in Kampuchea through negotiations.I should like to emphasize once again the importance that we continue to attach to the efforts deployed to bring about a constructive and fruitful dialogue in the Korean peninsula. We welcome the initiative taken by the Republic of Korea to reopen the suspended dialogue between the two countries. We hope that the parties concerned will keep working on such a process and engender the conditions necessary to lead to their representation in the United Nations.With regard to Central America  we hope that the new regional effort undertaken this summer on the initiative of Costa Rica within the framework of the Contadora process will promote peaceful solutions to the problems that confront the countries of the region. In this regard  we welcomed the peace plan adopted at that meeting of the Heads of State of the five Central American countries  held in Guatemala City in August. We hope that it will generate a new momentum towards resolving the problems of the Central American region through negotiations within a democratic process.On the international economic scene  the major challenge before us continues to be the reactivation of the development process and the restoration of sustained growth in the world. We all know that events of recent years have not been favourable in this respect. Many countries in the developing world have registered negative growth rates  and the economic growth in the industrialized countries has remained slow as compared to the 1960s and 1970s.I should like to submit that the international community cannot and should not be complacent about this situation. In fact  the possibilities and potential available in today's world can indeed turn the tide provided that the community of nations implements the necessary measures in a timely manner.The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) constituted a landmark in this respect. At that Conference a common approach was adopted by the international community in order to deal with the problems besetting both the developed and the developing world. Countries individually and as groups respectively made common commitments and accepted obligations which are clearly and exhaustively stated in the Geneva Final Act. The Conference was realistic and pragmatic  both in the assessment of the world economic situation and the in remedies to be applied. The concept of interdependence has acquired a tangible and meaningful substance. A strong consensus has emerged as to the need for higher global growth with a view to improving the international economic environment and rendering it more conducive to the solution of the problems of indebtedness and protectionism and acceleration of the process of structural adjustment. I wish to focus on an issue of high importance to the developing world from the viewpoint of both integration and development. Protectionism has made deep inroads into the industrialized economies. UNCTAD VII rightly diagnosed the need to revitalize international trade as a means of creating the additional resources needed to overcome development problems. It is important that growth-oriented policies be accompanied by the removal of protectionist barriers. We hope that the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations will usher in a more open system of international trade. We support the idea of an immediate standstill and wider roll back in the early stages of multilateral negotiations.Needless to say  the curtailment of access to the markets of the industrialized world will only compound the debt problem. Careful though Turkey is about its debt payments  we would none the less hasten to state that the time has come for more sustained and balanced trade to overcome the development problems of  especially  the middle income countries. We should like to underline the fundamental contradiction in introducing restrictions on imports from the developing world while expecting debt payments to proceed smoothly.We believe that in addition to universal action there is much to be done at the national level. The Turkish experience is worth recalling in this respect.Only eight years ago our economy was on the verge of collapse. Vital imports had ceased because of severe foreign currency shortages and production had come to a virtual standstill. As a result of the market-oriented and liberal trade policies that we have pursued  Turkey today maintains the highest rate of economic growth among the countries members of the Organisation for Economic Co—operation and Development (OECD)  with exports having quadrupled since the early 1980s and industrial goods comprising 78 per cent of total exports. We are currently experiencing a boom in tourism and other services. In April 1987 Turkey applied to the European Community for full membership  confident that its economy had for the most part reached the level of competitiveness for such an undertaking. There are still big challenges ahead  but we are confident of our future.Let me now stress the importance of initiatives which the developing world can take collectively. A concrete example is the Committee for Economic and Commercial Co-operation of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  which held its third meeting in Istanbul earlier this month. Within a short period this institution has registered palpable achievements. One such has been the creation of a long-term trade financing scheme. Such possibilities and potentialities abound in South-south co-operation.However  a sustained and organized impetus is needed in the form of investments and capital inflow  better access to the markets of the industrialized world and facilities for debt repayment in support of growth-oriented structural adjustment policies in developing countries. Increasing responsibility falls on the industrialized world to help overcome development problems by improving the international environment and sensibly raising their growth rate.In concluding  I wish to express my hope that the forty-second session of the General Assembly will be able to contribute to the search for peace and co-operation in the world."
"139",7054,"TZA",42,1987,"First	of	all	I	wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I trust that under your able and skilled guidance this Assembly will succeed in realizing the aspirations of all peace-loving people in the world.I should like also to congratulate our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts to promote international peace  security and co-operation. He needs the assistance of all Member States in this difficult and challenging task. I wish to assure him of Tanzania's continued co-operation and support in this noble endeavor.Delegates will recall that the last time a President of the United Republic of Tanzania addressed this Assembly was during the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. My predecessor  Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere  then renewed Tanzania's faith in the United Nations. He stressed ""In this  my last address to the General Assembly  I have described events and ... needs as we in Tanzania perceive them. My country will not stop saying those things when the new President takes over. For we are a poor and underdeveloped country  and we have no power in the world except the power of speech given by the Assembly - and by our humanity. To be silent when we see danger  to refrain from attacking policies which we see as contrary to the interests of peace and justice  would be to surrender our freedom and our dignity. That we shall never do."" (A/40/PV.13  p. 21)So  as the new President of the United Republic of Tanzania  I thought it would be appropriate for me to come and reaffirm that stand before the international community. My country  which became the 104th member of this Organization in 1961  will continue to use the United Nations rostrum to air its concern for and belief in peace  justice and equality. With goodwill towards all the 159 nations represented here  I wish to renew our faith in the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.For the United Nations has always played and will continue to play a key role in its primary responsibility  namely  the maintenance of international peace and security. We acknowledge that the United Nations has its imperfections  but we must also accept the fact that Member States are largely responsible for these shortcomings. The United Nations can only do what its Member States are willing to do; thus the collective security system envisaged under the Charter has not worked because some Member States have refused to implement certain provisions of the Charter. The permanent members of the Security Council in particular have not co-operated very often in resolving conflicts.The majority of the Members of this Organization were not represented at the founding of the United Nations because they were not yet independent at that time. It should not be surprising  therefore  when those newly-independent countries advocate the democratization of this Organization. They do so in order to ensure that their views and interests are fully taken into account in the decision-making process. It is for that reason that they have often called for a fresh look at theprincipal organs  especially the Security Council  but that call has often been deliberately misunderstood by those whose vested interests are well entrenched in the United Nations Charter.Those countries do not want to accept the fact that the changing international scene and the nearly-universal membership of this Organization require that the United Nations be adjusted in order to accommodate the legitimate interests of its new majority. The detractors of the United Nations have used the demands of this new majority as a pretext for undermining this Organization and the spirit of internationalism. They have often adopted unilateral measures to suit their national interests.We appeal to those countries to reconsider their attitudes towards the United Nations in the interest of global peace. We all agree that there is room for improvement in our Organization. I am sure we can all work together to improve the effectiveness of this Organization. The adoption by consensus at the forty-first session of the General Assembly of resolution 41/213  on the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations  is an important step towards meeting that objective.In his report to the General Assembly last year the Secretary-General called upon the United Nations""to bring to an early end those conflicts which have long brought terrible tragedy to the countries and people directly involved and inhibited the growth of international confidence needed for the resolution of broader global problems"".	One such conflict exists in southern Africa. Apartheid  which has been condemned by this Organization as a crime against humanity  continues to pose a threat to peace and security in southern Africa. The South African regime has resorted to unprecedented violence involving the daylight shooting ofdemonstrators  mass detentions  including the detention of innocent children  and the vigorous imposition of a murderous state of emergency. In May this year it opened a new chapter in repression following elections involving the white minority only. In the euphoria of his victory Mr. Botha declared his determination to preserve his culture and to break the back of his opponents  especially the African National Congress.While the racist regime is intensifying its brutality against the black majority in South Africa  it is at the same time trying to deceive the world by making flimsy proposals to reform apartheid. Botha's recent proposals to establish a national statutory council and regional service councils with black representation are purely cosmetic in nature. These proposals cannot end apartheid. They are intended to involve the black people in entrenching apartheid. It is not surprising  therefore  that they have been rejected by the African majority and its liberation movements. I wish to emphasize that apartheid is an evil that cannot be reformed  it must be abolished.In a frantic bid to maintain his minority rule and to direct attention away from his internal crimes  Botha also continues to carry out murderous raids on the front-line and other neighboring States. Every State in the subregion has been attacked:	Botswana 	Lesotho  Mozambique  Swaziland  Zambia and Zimbabwe. Angolahas been invaded by South Africa on many occasions  and parts of its territory have been occupied.The MNR and UNITA bandits continue to operate with impunity in Mozambique and Angola  respectively. The damage caused to these States by the racist regime and the bandits has been estimated at well over US* 10 billion over the past five years. In addition  the front-line States and other neighboring States have been subjected to economic pressure. The aim of the apartheid regime is to intimidate these States so that they end their support for the freedom struggle against minority rule.What is even more disappointing is that this crime of apartheid is being committed in the twentieth century  before the eyes of the civilized world. ThiB crime against humanity is being fully documented  aired and viewed day after day in international forums and in the living rooms of many homes around the world.Representations have been made to Governments in all continents  but they seem tohave fallen on deaf ears. The world appears completely to have ignored the pleas of the oppressed people of southern Africa. There has been no serious move to stop that blatant crime  let alone punish its perpetrators.Surely  generations to come will wonder how our generation could have stood by so passively while such an abominable crime was being committed  in the same way as we wonder how a past generation could have been so passive in the face of Hitler's crimes against the Jews. We urge Member States and the international community as a whole to act decisively and collectively to put an end to this intolerable inhumanity in southern Africa.It is encouraging to note that in many Western European countries and in the United States which have long-standing ties with apartheid South Africa  public opinion is increasingly turning against apartheid. Parliaments  individual legislators  trade unions and women's and youth organizations are exerting pressure on their Governments to take concrete action against apartheid.We were highly encouraged  for example  by the package of sanctions against South Africa which was approved by the United States Congress over a Presidential veto. We hope that Governments in these countries will live up to the expectations of their peoples and to the aspirations of the victims of apartheid.I wish to stress that the people of Tanzania - and  indeed  the people of the whole African continent - feel deeply grieved by the plight of the oppressed majority in south Africa and Namibia. We consider our own independence and freedom incomplete so long as there is apartheid in South Africa and brutal colonialism in Namibia. We therefore unreservedly support the right and efforts of the majority populations of these countries to regain their freedom and dignity by every means possible  including  when necessary  armed struggle.I am aware that there are countries whose abhorrence of violence restrainsthem from supporting armed struggles for liberation. It is a position that we finddifficult to understand  for we believe that the victim of a violent crime has the right to ward it off violently. Nevertheless  we respect the position of those countries. We hope  however  that they will support the call for the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa. This is the only peaceful means left by which to end apartheid. Such economic pressure will make the South African regime abandon apartheid. Without it  South Africa will not dismantle apartheid.We recognize that such sanctions will harm South Africa's neighbors and the front-line States. Their imposition must therefore be accompanied by a practical Program to support these States against the effects of sanctions  including those which a desperate apartheid regime will impose on them. Great sacrifices will be required  but they will be alleviated if sanctions are universally applied and seriously enforced.I wish to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to those countries which have demonstrated solidarity with the oppressed masses of southern Africa by imposing a variety of sanctions against South Africa  we are especially inspired by the sanctions imposed by the Nordic countries  Australia  New Zealand  Canada and some countries of the European Economic Community (EEC).It is unacceptable that Namibia remain under the illegal occupation of South Africa in spite of the United Nations having terminated the apartheid regime's Mandate 20 years ago. South Africa has shown its total contempt for and complete disregard of the United Nations by refusing to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).We consider the policy of linking the independence of Namibia to the withdrawal of the Cuban forces in Angola to be fundamentally misconceived and practically flawed. Besides prolonging the agony of the Namibian people underSouth Africa's brutal rule  it has sent the regime the message that it has powerful and dependable supporters in its policies of apartheid and destabilization.Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is the only internationally acceptable basis for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian problem. That resolution  which has the support of all Member States  does not establish any linkage between Namibia's independence and the withdrawal of Cuban forces. We therefore support the Secretary-General's efforts to get the parties concerned to start implementing that resolution. We also reaffirm our total support for the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people in its struggle to free its country from colonial occupation.The United Nations cannot avoid its historical duty and its role in assisting South Africa and Namibia to be free. Time for a peaceful or less violent change is fast running out. Without decisive action by the international community the situation in southern Africa will further deteriorate and lead to increased bloodshed. We have a moral obligation to avert such a situation.Tanzania is equally distressed by the injustices that are taking place in the Middle East. It is nearly 40 years since the Palestinian people were forcibly evicted from their homeland. For 20 years Israel has illegally occupied Arab territories. We resolutely call for the complete and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from those territories. We reaffirm our support for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to an independent State under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).It is also our sincere hope that a peaceful settlement will be found to the conflict between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic.It is indeed our hope that the people of that Republic will be allowed to determine their own affairs freely and without external interference.Regional conflicts where great-Power interests either converge or diverge exist in other parts of the world. We are pleased to note that in Afghanistan and Cyprus the good offices of the Secretary-General have been invoked in order to protect the non-aligned character of those countries.In Kampuchea  we believe that a political settlement involving all the parties should be arrived at without external interference. This would lead to the establishment of a peaceful  independent and non-aligned country. We believe that the eight-point proposal of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the proposals made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations constitute an important element in such a settlement.We deplore the aggravation of the situation in Central America by external interference. We support the efforts of the Nicaraguan people and Government to defend their sovereignty. The Guatemala proposal  which was agreed upon by the five Central American leaders on 7 August 1987  deserves our wholehearted support.We are equally concerned about the tension in the Korean peninsula. We believe that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the peninsula is an important condition of the stability of the region. A dialog between North and South Korea and the holding of tripartite talks between the two Koreas and the United States should be encouraged.Tanzania has diplomatic relations with both Iraq and Iran. Our people cherish the most friendly feelings towards the Governments and peoples of those two countries. We renew our appeal to them to find a political settlement to their dispute and to stop the war between them. We urge all great Powers to refrain from taking any measures that would escalate the war and create a more serious threat to regional and global peace. We particularly urge the permanent members of the Security Council to shoulder their collective responsibility and to act in unity in the search for a peaceful settlement of that conflict.We appeal for the exercise of wisdom so that peaceful solutions can be found to all these conflicts. Global peace would be greatly enhanced if all nations would strictly respect the sovereignty and independence of other nations and refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of others. The threat or use of force should never be made a basis for settling disputes. We should all scrupulously observe the norms of international law governing relations between sovereign and independent nations.Another great threat to the survival of mankind is the arms race  particularly in nuclear weapons. Over $US 1 trillion is wasted each year in that senselessrace. Resources which could be used for economic and social development are . squandered in a competition which threatens the very survival of mankind.Some of us had hoped that the Soviet moratorium on nuclear testing would start a process leading to a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests. Regrettably  the opportunity was lost. Nuclear tests continue to be conducted by all nuclear Powers. As a participant in the six-nation peace initiative  Tanzania renews its appeal to the nuclear Powers  especially the two major ones  to halt nuclear tests and ban the arms race in space. In the name of humanity we appeal for respect for our right to life  which is now threatened by nuclear weapons.We are encouraged by the agreement in principle reached between the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. We consider that agreement to be an initial step towards the ultimate objective of general and complete disarmament.Peace and poverty cannot coexist. The economic underdevelopment of the third world  therefore  is also a threat to world peace. While only one third of humanity thrives in prosperity  two thirds of mankind are submerged in abject poverty. Hunger  disease and ignorance afflict hundreds of millions of our people. Ironically  this is not because the world lacks the necessary resources to meet the needs of all mankind.We are told by the rich industrialized countries that a fair redistribution of the world's resources can take place only through the virtues of free trade. But we all know very well that the champions of so-called free trade are the very ones that institute strong protectionist measures against the exports of developing countries. As a result of such measures third-world countries are denied access to the markets of the industrialized countries. Prices for their export commodities remain depressed  while the prices of manufactured goods imported from theindustrialized countries rise constantly. This has resulted in unfavorable termsof trade  severe balance-of-payments deficits and an ever growing debt burden for our countries.It is estimated  for example  that the third world owes the developed countries about $US 1 000 billion. In 1985 alone the developing countries paid $US 115 billion in debt servicing and received only $US 41 billion in new loans.In other words  there was a net outflow of $US 74 billion from the poor South to the rich North. The export earnings of non-oil-producing developing countries also dropped from $US 104 billion in 1980 to $US 87 billion in 1985. This was caused by declining prices of their export commodities. So  in addition to their export earnings  the developing countries had to look for an additional amount of $US 28 billion solely to service their debts. There is an urgent need for the creditors and borrowers to discuss this serious problem with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable solution.The increasing outflow of resources from the poor to the rich through debt servicing and unfavorable terms of trade aggravates the already critical economic situation in the third world. This is a direct result of the existing inequitable world economic system  which only works in favor of the rich industrialized countries. The present system has failed to respond effectively to the development efforts of the developing countries. It is for this reason that the gap between the rich North and the poor South has been widening year after year.It is obvious  therefore  that the success of the development efforts being made by the developing countries  both individually and collectively  through South-South co-operation  will depend to a large extent on the restructuring of the existing world economic system. This is the basis of our pleas for the establishment of the new international economic order.We  the third-world countries  have always demonstrated our willingness to negotiate with our colleagues of the North on this important issue. We feel that there is an urgent need to take concerted measures which will promote the development of the developing countries and establish more equitable relations between the North and the South. Our efforts  however  have often been frustrated by the lack of political will on the part of some developed countries which wish to cling to their privileged position at the expense of the suffering majority.We appeal to those countries to reconsider their position in the interest of justice and prosperity for all mankind. We also believe that the United Nations has a moral obligation to ensure that the struggle for the establishment of a more equitable world order succeeds  so that all mankind can be saved from hunger  starvation and abject poverty.We therefore appeal for the revival and early commencement of the global negotiations aimed at the establishment of the new international economic order.These negotiations should put particular emphasis on structural changes in the field of trade and development and on the removal of trade barriers  especially to the exports of the developing countries. The international financial and monetary system should also be restructured. Such a restructuring should take into account  among other things  the need to provide adequate and predictable development resources to the developing countries in order to accelerate their development. Efforts should be made in particular to achieve as quickly as possible the long agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance to developing countries.For an ailing person the key to recovery is the will and determination to live. This also applies to economic recovery. Africa has demonstrated its will and determination to achieve economic recovery by adopting its Priority Program for Economic Recovery at the 21st summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  in 1985. This Program stresses the need for increased co-operation between African countries. We recognize  however  that the support of the international community is necessary for the implementation of the Program. At the thirteenth special session of this Assembly many donor countries expressed their willingness to assist.I should like to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to countries and international organizations  especially the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)   for the assistance they have so far given. We hope that others will make this assistance available as soon as possible.I wish to conclude by reiterating Tanzania's faith in the United Nations. We believe that the United Nations has a great potential to maintain international peace and to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples. It is true that the Organization has had some problems  some of which have sometimes threatened its very existence. But we must not let frustration  cynicism or despairovercome us. The idealism which gave birth to the United Nations is still relevant and powerful; the principles upon which the Organization was founded remain valid.We must therefore strive to build a strong and stable world order based on the principles of sovereign equality. We must rededicate ourselves to the cause of fostering coexistence  co-operation and interdependence. We must work with one another constructively to make our Organization both the symbol and the platform for the evolution of a system of universal peace and security  a system which will fully take into account and help to promote the interests and aspirations of all countries and peoples.I renew Tanzania's pledge to co-operate in meeting the challenge of realizing this noble objective."
"140",7144,"UKR",42,1987,"﻿We should like you  Sir  to convey our greetings to comrade Peter Florin on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. We wish him every success in the discharge of his lofty and responsible functions.The forty-second session of the General Assembly is taking place at a crucial turning-point. It is called upon to make use of all its authority in order to consolidate the positive changes in world affairs  overcome confrontational stereotypes and put into practice the new political thinking in international relations.There has emerged in international affairs a certain encouraging movement towards the realization of the aspirations of the peoples of the world for the preservation of peace and the strengthening of security. These hopes have not been brought about by unfounded optimism or by wishful thinking. There has appeared on the political horizon a real prospect for achieving agreements on the most pressing problem of reducing nuclear arms and improving the international atmosphere as a whole.What exactly do we have in mind? Above all  what we have in mind is the agreement in principle between the USSR and the United States to conclude a treaty on the complete elimination of two classes of nuclear missiles: shorter-range and medium-range. For the first time in history the idea of nuclear disarmament is close to fruition. Should this very first - and hence especially difficult - step be accomplished  international relations would be placed on an entirely new footing. Such agreement would have not only a major political and military significance  but would also change the whole situation psychologically. After all  up to now there has been only a process of building up nuclear arsenals.Secondly  Reykjavik and the Soviet-United States talks in Washington have shown that  given political will  it is possible  in principle  to cut back substantially the strategic offensive arms of the two biggest nuclear Powers  provided that the Treaty on anti-ballistic missiles (ABM) is strictly complied with. Given a mutual desire  agreement on a 50-per-cent reduction in their strategic offensive arms could become a reality as early as the first half of 1988.Our optimism is bolstered by the progress made at the Geneva talks in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament  where the representatives of the countries are on the verge of concluding a convention on banning chemical weapons and destroying stockpiles of such weapons. Favourable conditions for such a change of course have been created as a result of the deliberate choice made by States in favour of restraint and self-imposed limitations. The sphere of the sensible  responsible and rational organization of  international affairs is expanding  albeit timidly  before our very eyes"". That is the conclusion reached by Mikhail S. Gorbachev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  in his article ""The reality and the guarantees of a secure world""  which has been perceived by world public opinion as a doctrine of a world free from nuclear weapons and violence.The article  which was timed to coincide with the opening of the session of the United Nations General Assembly  contains some anxious thoughts on what could be done  and how  by the community of nations to make peace a political reality even before the end of this century. It emphasizes that natural processes are spontaneously creating a situation where our complex and diverse world is becoming increasingly interrelated and interdependent  and this world is increasingly in need of machinery to enable us to discuss together - in a responsible fashion and at a representative level - and deal together with its common problems; and it is the United Nations that was intended to constitute such machinery. The Ukrainian SSR has always supported  and continues to support  the idea of enhancing the role of the United Nations as an irreplaceable instrument of peace and harmonization of the efforts of States  as well as the idea of strengthening the political  legal and moral status of the United Nations and making its activities more democratic. Our commitment to this Organization was reaffirmed once again with the utmost clarity during the recent visit to the Ukrainian SSR by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar.Today  international relations cannot be built if the interests of all States are not taken into account. The balance of interests should be observed  for it alone produces sensible policies. To that end  we must therefore learn to harness our national interests to purposes common to all mankind. All this is felt especially keenly here at the United Nations.In the kaleidoscope of problems posed by our times  one task stands out: to ensure the survival of mankind and save it from nuclear self-annihilation. The arms race  produced by the wrong-headed strategy of nuclear deterrence and containment  is crippling the life of civilization on Earth; it consumes annually nearly $1 trillion - funds so badly needed to ease the plight of hundreds of millions of people suffering from poverty  hunger and disease.Is it possible that  at the end of the twentieth century  we will allow the clangour of the anvils that are forging the weapons to drown out the voice of reason and warning? Is it really possible that we are incapable of combining the capabilities and the will of States and peoples in order to rid mankind of the prospect of total destruction?For the sake of the survival of mankind  for the sake of its salvation and development  for the sake of the life of present and succeeding generations  it is imperative that all the strength  authority and influence of the United Nations be devoted to the cause of creating a nuclear-free and non-violent world.Outside the movement towards a nuclear-free and non-violent world - and this is our profound conviction - there is not and cannot be any path to the progress of mankind. This conclusion underlies the new political thinking  which we believe is meeting with the understanding of all sensible men and women. The looming danger of the destruction of civilization makes it imperative  indeed vital  for diverse social and political forces to unite and create a coalition of political realism  reason and good will.The new political thinking and the foreign policy that goes with it  which is based on an objective analysis of the world of today  presuppose a sober and judicious view of the diversity of forces that make up world politics  and emanate from the awareness of the responsibility for the survival of mankind. They are oriented towards the development and building of trust among nations  towards the actual implementation of the principle of the peaceful coexistence of States as the supreme universal norm in relations between nations. An important step in that direction would be the adoption by the forty-second session of the General Assembly of a declaration on the renunciation of the threat or use of force in international relations.It was the criterion of common human values that guided the socialist States  including the Ukrainian SSR  when they proposed in the United Nations the initiative to establish a comprehensive system of international peace and security. The co-sponsors of the proposal proceeded from the principle of the indivisibility of international security  which cannot but be global and equal for all and which must encompass the military  political  economic  environmental and humanitarian spheres. Such a security system would lead to the building of a nuclear-free world  where the threat or the use of force would be ruled out and relations among nations would be built in a spirit of mutual respect  friendship and co-operation. The ongoing broad exchange of views in the United Nations on these matters confirms the fact that the socialist countries' initiative is aimed at surmounting confrontational approaches and establishing civilized norms of relations and an atmosphere of mutual understanding and trust in the practice of international affairs.The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR is in favour of continuing and developing constructive international dialogue  for the purpose or jointly searching for ways and means of shaping a comprehensive system of international peace and security and adopting concrete measures to provide material  political  legal  moral and psychological safeguards for a world free from the nuclear threat. What the socialist countries are proposing to the world community is not a short-term concept but a long-term  rational programme that invites everyone to strive for peaceful and mutually beneficial international relations. The Ukrainian SSR expresses the hope that the United Nations will make a substantial contribution to the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security  in strict compliance with the Organization's purposes and principles and on the basis of its Charter  and will act as that system's effective and authoritative guarantor.Thus  the concept of security  as we see it  is both a new political and philosophic vision of the age which mankind has entered and a programme of concrete actions to ensure practical movement towards a nuclear-free and non—violent world and - from the historical standpoint - towards a demilitarised world. Arms limitation and disarmament undoubtedly form a foundation for the edifice of general security. On 15 January 1986 the Soviet Union proposed a programme to rid the world of nuclear weapons. This document contains clear-cut stages stretching to the year 2000 - a world without means of mass destruction - a peaceful outer space  the restriction of the military potentials of States to the limits of reasonable sufficiency. Its significance lies in the fact that it marks the beginning of the process of merging new political thinking with practice.We proceed from the belief that it is impossible to resolve completely the questions of nuclear disarmament within the sole framework of relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America  Here  the United Nations - which  I must say  plays a unique role in the movement towards a nuclear-weapon-free world - can and should make an important contribution· The Ukrainian SSR would like to see the most made of the Organization's potential for that purpose  putting to use all existing negotiating mechanisms  including such an important body as the Security Council·The question of banning nuclear tests occupies a special place in the whole range of nuclear disarmament problems· The critical need to resolve that question is explained by the fact that the reduction of nuclear arsenals cannot in itself  without the banning of nuclear--weapon tests  solve the problem  since it leaves open the possibility of modernizing the remaining part of such weapons - that is of developing ever-more-sophisticated and deadly nuclear weapons. Hence  a nuclear-test ban is a concrete step towards the genuine elimination of nuclear arms.The document entitled ""Basic Provisions of a Treaty on the General and Complete Prohibition of Nuclear Tests""  submitted by the socialist countries at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  provides good opportunities for constructive talks on this subject- The delegation of the Ukrainian USSR believes that dealing with this question in practical terms as soon as possible would be in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of States. We hail the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States to start before 1 December full-scale negotiations on the limitation and  ultimately  the total cessation of nuclear tests.The agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the United States on the establishment of nuclear-risk-reduction centres deserves our approval. The Ukrainian SSR supports the Secretary-General's proposal for the establishment of a multilateral centre to reduce the threat of war. In our view  a direct communication line linking United Nations Headquarters with the capitals of the permanent members of the Security Council and the place where the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement is located could serve the same purpose. The socialist States propose a peaceful alternative to counter irrational bids for nuclear supremacy. The Ukrainian SSR calls upon all countries to take an active part in implementing the programme to establish an international regime for the safe development of nuclear energy production  which provides for a whole series of material  scientific and technological measures  supplemented by international legal norms and agreements. The programme could prevent people from making errors and from incurring incidents fraught with dire consequences for their life and health .The prevention of an arms race in outer space is yet another concern for all mankind. Preparations for ""Star Wars"" should not be allowed to become irreversible and to create insurmountable obstacles to disarmament. We are convinced that the strategic defence initiative programme is disastrous. This is recognized by many people  including people in the United States. The strategic defence initiative is an exclusively militaristic programme designed to gain military superiority and undermine strategic stability in the world.In this key area the lack of realistic policies is particularly severe. Concrete actions are needed· First  the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems  which is the corner-stone of strategic stability  should be strictly complied with.It is time for the talks on concluding an agreement or agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space to begin at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The objective of the talks could be agreements on such problems as the prohibition of weapons systems of the space-to-space and space-to-Earth type  the non-development of new anti-satellite weapons and the elimination of existing weapons of this type  and guarantees of the immunity of man-made Earth satellites. It is also necessary to concentrate efforts on solving as soon as possible another urgent problem - ridding the world of chemical weapons. I have already said that promising progress has been made at the talks within the framework of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. The proposals put forward there recently by various States clear the way to agreement. The proposal to proceed on the basis of the need to make legally binding the principle of mandatory challenge inspections without the right of denial is a concrete contribution to the success of the talks.We reiterate our support for the initiatives taken by the German Democratic Republic  Czechoslovakia  Bulgaria and Romania to establish zones free from chemical weapons in Central Europe and the Balkans.The movement towards genuine security through disarmament presupposes  in addition to the elimination of the weapons of mass destruction  urgent agreed on reductions in conventional arms and armed forces. The socialist countries have repeatedly stated their readiness to go as far as other countries are prepared to go on this question. As will be recalled  to confirm their readiness they made specific proposals in June 1986 on a substantial reduction of armed forces and armaments in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals  subject to far-reaching verification.The co-ordination and implementation of exhaustive measures for international control over disarmament and permitted military activities  including verification at foreign military bases  and the adoption by all nuclear Powers of defensive military doctrines would make it possible radically to consolidate confidence among States.The Ukrainian SSR supports the initiative of the Polish People's Republic for a reduction of armaments and a strengthening of trust in central Europe  known as the Jaruzelski plan. I emphasize our conviction that the release of financial resources and intellectual potential for the purposes of social and economic development  including that of developing countries  should form an integral part of all disarmament measures. We believe that every step on the way to arms reduction should not only increase the security of nations but also provide more resources for raising the standards of living of the peoples. Our position was clearly reflected in the memorandum ""Disarmament for development"" submitted by the socialist countries at the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development.The edifice of peace cannot be solid if any part of it is not covered by the security system. That is why the Ukrainian SSR is firmly in favour of settling conflict situations and eliminating regional focuses of tension.Particularly prominent among them is the Middle East conflict  one of the oldest and most explosive hotbeds of international tension. The development of the situation in the Middle East has made abundantly clear the failure of reliance on military force  confrontation or separate deals. Genuine settlement is possible only through the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  the exercise by the people of Palestine of their inalienable right to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent State  and a guarantee of the right of all countries in the region to secure existence and development. The convening  under United Nations auspices  of a plenipotentiary international Middle East conference  with the participation  on an equal footing  of all the parties concerned  including the PLO as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and the permanent members of the Security Council  would be a reasonable and correct way to bring about a just peace in the region. A broad international consensus has emerged in favour of convening such a conference. The position of the present Israeli Government is the only stumbling-block.It is at the negotiating table that political solutions to the issues between Iran and Iraq and an end to the fratricidal war between them should be sought.The build-up by the United States and some other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries of a massive naval presence in the relatively confined area in which the war is raging is fraught with unpredictable grave consequences.The Ukrainian SSR supports implementing Security Council resolution 598 (1987) in full  maintaining and consolidating on that basis the unity of action of its permanent members. We attach particular significance to political efforts within the United Nations framework to switch the Iran-Iraq conflict onto the track of a peaceful solution. We believe that the Secretary-General can play a big part in finding a just settlement acceptable to both sides. The interests of universal security  like the vital interests of the Cypriot people  urgently require collective international efforts to remedy the crisis situation in Cyprus. The proper way to resolve this problem  as we see it  would be to call  within the United Nations framework  a representative international conference which would be in a position to work out essential components of an agreement such as the demilitarisation of the island and the establishment of a system of effective international guarantees of the independence  sovereignty  unity  and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. We support the good offices mission of the Secretary-General and the active role of our Organization in this matter. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic shares the anxiety of the world community about the explosive situation in Central America  We strongly demand that an end be put to the United States Administration's interference in the affairs of Nicaragua  and declare our firm solidarity with the just struggle of the Nicaraguan people. It is possible to attain mutually acceptable solutions in that region  as is conclusively borne out by the agreements reached by the Central American States concerning ways of securing lasting peace in the region. It would be in the interests of international peace and security to settle promptly the conflict in southern Africa  which continues to be a dangerous hotbed of tension. The apartheid regime in South Africa is stepping up its repression of the country's indigenous population  pursuing its strategic course of destabilizing the front-line States  bringing military and political pressure to bear upon them  and is continuing its occupation of Namibia. It is not merely changes by way of so-called reforms but rather a complete and definitive elimination of apartheid that is the indispensable condition for achieving peace and security in the region. The Ukrainian SSR strongly supports the call by African States for the introduction of all-embracing mandatory sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa  in accordance with the United Nations Charter.A good basis for normalizing the situation in South-East Asia is the realistic proposal by Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea for the establishment of a zone of lasting peace  stability and co-operation in the region. The national reconciliation policy launched by the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea would facilitate the early and real attainment of those goals.The Ukrainian SSR associates itself with the course advocated by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea  namely the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and the reunification of the country on a democratic basis  without outside interference. We fully support the proposal by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea to turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone.We have dwelt on just a few hotbeds of tension. Their elimination and the prevention of new crises and conflicts at the regional and global levels is part and parcel of efforts to shape a comprehensive system of international peace and security. An important part of that  concept relates to the economic aspects. Changes in the world economy and in international economic relations  like changes in the political sphere  are characterized by their growing interrelationship.This is where the interdependence of States is likely to manifest itself most conspicuously  yet# given the existing international economic order  the consequences of that interrelationship affect various countries in a hideously lopsided way  grossly infringing the elementary notions of equality  justice and honesty. Some reap billion-dollar profits while others are slipping further into the abyss of economic and financial collapse. All this is fraught with the most serious political implications.The existence in international economic relations of such potentially explosive elements as non-equivalent exchanges  the bondage of debt and other forms of neo-colonialist plundering of the developing nations involves a real danger of upheavals that could jeopardize universal peace·We believe that an important contribution to the ensuring of international security could be made by measures designed to bring under control the process of economic interdependence of States  measures that would ensure predictability and stability in inter-State relations and ultimately ensure the safe and mutually beneficial character of world economic exchanges. To fulfil that task  all countries of the world  big and small  industrialized and developing  irrespective of their social systems and levels of development  should unite their efforts and work together.The co-operation of States in the environmental and humanitarian spheres is an integral part of the process a moulding a comprehensive system of security. It is inadmissible to extend ideological differences to international relations or to use the problem of human rights and social development for the purposes of fomenting confrontation  just as it is inadmissible to apply double standards..We call on all States Members of the United Nations to be guided in their policies by the primacy of common human values and international law  to resolve disputes through negotiation/ and to rid themselves of the burden of confrontation and suspicion.The Ukrainian SSR intends to co-operative actively with other States in ensuring world peace and security  in a spirit of good will and in the awareness of the joint responsibility for the future of human civilization. That position is fully in conformity with the historic purposes and principles of the foreign policy of the Soviet State  whose seventieth anniversary will be celebrated on 7 November this year.In our minds  in our hearts  the socialist Revolution of 1917 is a matter of supreme national pride for the Soviet people. The Revolution gave rise to unprecedented enthusiasm and a creative vigour on the part of the broad masses of people and became the finest hour for the victorious people who had done away  once and for all  with the exploitation of man by man. Scores of years have gone by since unemployment was eliminated in our land. We have no oppression of ethnic minorities  no poverty  no illiteracy. The working people live in confidence that they are protected by society; they live in confidence about their future.The Great October Revolution continues even today in our deeds. In the Ukrainian SSR  as throughout the Soviet Union  a splendid process of perestroika is under way in all fields of life  for the purpose of accelerating the economic and social development of our socialist society.It is highly symbolic that the first legislative act of the Soviet State was the Decree of Peace. Our new political thinking as applied to foreign policy and our conduct in the international arena are linked integrally with Lenin's behest about a democratic and just world. As the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine  Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky  stressed: ""In carrying out that behest  our party and the Soviet State do everything they can to preserve and strengthen peace and to improve the complex and often explosive international situation.""The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR is convinced that the participants in this forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly will raise their voices in favour of such a way of acting and that the General Assembly itself will become a place and a school for co-operation and collaboration on the part of States in devising a concept of security for all  security in keeping with the realities of the nuclear and space age."
"141",7190,"URY",42,1987,"﻿Year after year we come to the Assembly concerned about the direction of international events  which  with disheartening persistence  weaken our hopes of laying the foundations of lasting peace in this century.It is not only a matter of our going through a period of crisis. In fact  the world  particularly in modern times  has been in permanent crisis. What makes today special in historical terms is the speed with which changes occur  their scope and mankind's manifest inability to manage them. It would seem that during these last few years  more than at any other time in history  ideas have been lagging behind events. That should not surprise us. The world has evolved so rapidly that we have had to give up our notion of life as order to think of it in terms of movement. May it not be that during recent years man's creative energy has developed mainly in the scientific and technological fields  leaving behind roan as a forger of ideas and institutions needed to bring order and leadership to the technological world that he has created? Today  more than ever  ideas are needed; ideas for regaining our mastery over a dynamic world that is going out of control and threatening to make us its prisoners.Faced with the gulf between facts and ideas  with the persistence of factors that work against peace and security  and with the international community's inability to put an end to them  or at least to mitigate their effects  we believe the time has come to pause  so that we may all proceed on the one hand to examine the extent to which the international system set up after the Second World War adequately responds to the problems of the world of today  and  on the other  seriously to analyse our own individual attitudes  which  based solely on the satisfaction of special interests  threaten the most elementary forms of the international co-operation which we have so laboriously and hopefully built up over four post-war decades.Uruguay has already stated in other forums that the poor performance of the international system  both in political and economic terms  is due largely to a turning away from the fundamental principles on which the post-war international order was built - international solidarity and multilateralism. By pointing here to the crisis involving these principles  we are not simply referring nostalgically to ethical and political values of the past. We are pointing out the validity of two pillars of international relations  which we cannot put aside in the interest of pragmatism or so-called realism. If we wish to build a more equitable world  we must keep in step with the realities  but not at the price of undermining the climate of understanding and dialogue which we have created during these last 40 years.That is why it is necessary to view international problems in a global context- A world of peace and justice can be based only on the conviction that there are no national interests that are not of concern to the international community that what a country does or fails to do will have  in varying degree  repercussions on the international environment; that  if I may paraphrase  nothing that involves any State can be unimportant to the international community.Precisely because interdependence is today a fact which no country can avoid  we ask of the multilateral system an open and co-operative attitude so that the approach to and discussion of problems shall not be limited to partial  short-sighted views.Last year  on an occasion similar to this  when Uruguay reiterated its support for the United Nations  we stated our belief in the need for an in-depth  unprejudiced and comprehensive analysis of the instruments available to the international community to achieve its common objectives in order to determine their adequacy in present circumstances and the measures needed to correct their failings and limitations. We still believe that such an analysis is necessary and that we must not delay it  going beyond the recent studies and proposals on restructuring.This exercise must be carried out within the ethical and legal framework of the principles of the San Francisco Charter  and the United Nations must continue to be the main channel for international co-operation and solving political disputes. Our confidence in the Organization as an instrument of peace was recently strengthened when it was resorted to in an attempt to put an end to the tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq  which has gone on for years.Uruguay is grateful for the spirit of compromise and the will to co-operate shown by the permanent members of the Security Council on this occasion  as well as for the Secretary-General's bold efforts. We trust that the Organization's intervention and the aggressive diplomatic action by the Secretary-General will be instrumental in restoring peace to that troubled region.Despite what I have said so far  there are encouraging signs that we must not ignore  signs that make us think that the world is today better prepared than ever to adopt this comprehensive and long-term view  which the solution of our common problems demands. That is what happens when we observe the democratisation process of the last 15 years  which  despite accidental set-backs and collapses  has continued to move forward and has become consolidated in all the regions of the world.Moves towards democratisation  begun in the 1970s when there were important political changes in countries of southern Europe  later spread to all regions of the world and were substantially furthered by the recent democratic recovery of almost all the countries of Latin America. This process is  in the judgement of the Government of Uruguay  a decisive factor in the pursuit of peace and security. Democracy  understood as the political system which is based on free and periodic election of its authorities  is the system which by its very essence ensures respect for human rights  the political independence of States and the ethical and legal principles which must govern international relations. There is a close undeniable relationship between peace and the effective exercise of democracy. History teaches us that the most serious disputes and wars of the past were almost always caused by authoritarian  expansionist and colonialist regimes. This is illustrated at the present time by the persistence of the Government of South Africa in continuing its intolerable policy of apartheid and the illegal occupation of the Territory of Namibia  which is a clear threat to peace and an infringement of human rights  against which the formal repudiation of the international community seems not to be a sufficient reply.On the other hand  the democracies are experiencing a natural rapprochement leading to solidarity and co-operation. What is happening at present in the Latin American regional environment is an example of how democratic Governments can coexist in peace and work for peace. For some time now  these Governments have decided to co-ordinate their efforts to find a solution to the great problems that afflict the hemisphere  initiating a process of active  direct and responsible diplomacy hitherto unprecedented in Latin America. In this search they have established informal procedures for consultation  co-ordination and negotiation in diverse areas including  inter alia  the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts  economic integration and policy co-ordination in areas such as external debt and financial and trade questions.The forthcoming meeting of eight presidents of the region will be a significant step towards Latin American solidarity and towards the political presence of the region in the world. The Contadora Group and the Support Group  of which Uruguay is a member  continue to be  despite the enormous difficulties they have had to face  a vigorous expression of solidarity in the hemisphere. The Contadora Group has had a decisive Influence on the search for a formula for a satisfactory political solution to the already long and painful drama of Central America. The end of this drama is up to the protagonists themselves  but it is undeniable that Contadora and Its Support Group have played an essential role in bringing the parties together and in dissuading them from finding any but a political or diplomatic solution to the problem.We hope that we are witnessing the last act of this drama and that its outcome will be a solution based on the principles of non-intervention  the free choice of peoples and genuine democratisation and pluralism. On this occasion I wish to pay a tribute to President Arias of Costa Rica  whose efforts towards the restoration of peace in Central America deserve the gratitude of all of Latin America. The recent Esquipulas II agreements  which have been mentioned today  are a bold  responsible and dispassionate step taken by the Central American countries themselves. They deserve our full support and call for solidarity and non-Interference on the part of all countries  especially those which have direct or indirect interests in the region. Let us  then  with our political solidarity and our co-operation  help the Central American peoples themselves to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region. The Latin American democracies are thus United in their search for peace in the region and the welfare of their peoples  but enormous efforts are necessary if democracy is to be maintained in the developing countries. By its very nature it is a vulnerable system and its vulnerability increases in an economic and political environment which is not propitious for it  especially the international environment which conditions and influences our destinies to such a degree. On the one hand  the democracies are threatened by a set of economic factors which seriously endanger their survival. This fact was stated by the President of our country. President Sanguinetti  in this Assembly in 1985 in these words:""A genuine democracy ... can be preserved only within an economic context that allows its citizens to provide for their basic material and spiritual needs. ... when this condition is not fulfilled and poverty and unemployment prevail  violence emerges and is unleashed  the powers of disorder take advantage of the fertile soil  the fabric of society disintegrates and  in the international sphere  political loyalties become erratic."" (A/40/PV.6  p. 12) Just as development without democracy inevitably leads to authoritarianism and totalitarianism  sacrificing freedom and human rights  democracy without economic development ends up being an empty form  which inexorably leads to political and social instability.Much time has passed since the idea that political and social peace were not possible in an economically divided world became part of the basic tenets of international reality; none the less economic contrasts and contradictions have only increased and deepened. It is not germane at present to attribute responsibilities or identify those at fault; fortunately  awareness of our interdependence has developed sufficiently to make us understand that  just as we have all been Involved in the genesis of the present situation  we must all suffer  its consequences if no satisfactory solution is found. It is paradoxical that despite the fact that we are fully aware of our responsibilities we have not taken the necessary action to reverse the trends that are leading us to a dead end. Current economic indicators regarding trade  production  consumption  investment and financing do not allow for optimistic forecasts) the pace of world economic activity has lessened and in most of the developing countries the recessive trends that have characterized the development of their economies in the last few years still prevail.When trying to face these problems the developing countries are at a great disadvantage and we stressed this in the recent meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Several factors have contributed to the worsening of their situation: in the first place  the renewal of protectionist pressures by industrialized countries. Those countries have kept up costly programmes of domestic support to certain productive sectors  thus limiting international competition. Perhaps more serious yet has been the use of export incentives and subsidies  which are incompatible with the standards governing international trade and which affect how world markets work by artificially distorting supply  which  in turn  has served to depress even more the price levels of products of special concern to the developing countries.On the other hand  prices of the main export commodities of developing countries have steadily declined  with some recent exceptions  but these exceptions seem to be linked rather to crises in exchange parities than to a true recovery in price levels.To this we must add the external debt problem. Although there has been progress in acknowledging joint responsibility in the origins and solution of the debt problem  as well as in acknowledging that the subject must be faced within a positive context of growth and adjustment policies  the international economic situation has made the tremendous adjustments carried out by the debtor countries insufficient. For the vast majority of our countries it is impossible simultaneously to grow  Invest and service their external debt. The massive transfer of financial resources abroad has continued  reaching unbearable dimensions for our economies.As was stated by our Presidents in the letter addressed recently by the Cartagena Consensus to the Venice Summit  ""We consider it essential to insist that the external debt problem binds us all  due not only to its causes but also to its consequences."" In the face of this dramatic situation  all that has been said and done so far is obviously not enough. It is not enough to acknowledge responsibilities and show understanding; nor are the partial measures which the most developed countries have adopted either individually or collectively enough. Efforts to understand the economic problems which afflict the developing countries today and the search for solutions must be but the starting-point from which the members of the international community should initiate effective co-operative action and support the transformation of developing countries.It is from this starting-point that  within the framework of serious and responsible international co-operation  we must undertake the necessary structural adjustments in both the developed and the developing countries  whatever may be their political and economic organization and whatever the relationships that link the members of each group together and to other groups.Indeed  the world cannot be based on principles of justice and equal opportunities in the economic field without adjustments in all economies  not just those of the developing countries.What is particularly needed is a decisive change of attitude on the part of the most developed countries  especially regarding trade. They must allow the developing countries to cease to be the depositories where the developed countries dump their subsidized excess production and the suppliers of raw materials paid for at unfairly low prices to finance the welfare of other peoples. The developing countries wish to have access to the markets of the developed countries and to obtain fair prices for their products so that they may be able to repay their debts and devote new credits to investment rather than to financing high interest rates.In making these statements our attitude is responsible and constructive: first  because the great adjustment required during the past few years  the worst since the great depression  was at the expense of the standards of living of the developing countries alone; and  secondly  because we have long abandoned the simplistic attitudes that cast the blame for all that happened in the developing countries on external forces or relationships.We  too  the third-world countries  must make a great adjustment effort which will allow us to play the role we should play in the world economy. In this context  we continue to believe that  in addition to the adoption of serious and responsible policies outside our own economies  all possibilities of South-South co-operation should be explored and used. We are convinced that there is still much to be done along these lines and that we  the developing countries  must establish the direction of this co-operation and the ways in which it must take place. In this context  we welcome and have great hopes of the recently established South-South Commission under the chairmanship of the illustrious African Statesman  President Nyerere.Not everything is dark in this field either. It would be unfair not to mention some of the facts which allow us to nurture modest hopes regarding future developments in economic matters.First  I must mention the new round of negotiations started in Uruguay last year within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Fulfilling the resolutions of the Punta del Este meeting  several working groups have been established and plans for negotiations have been approved. The parties are acting with a fitting sense of urgency and responsibility  and this justifies out optimism regarding the results to be obtained. The Uruguay round continues to deserve the full support of all its participants. Furthermore  it was comforting to note that at the recent Venice summit conference the Heads of State of the seven Western industrialized countries supported the objectives of trade liberalization and the strengthening of the multilateral trade system through the Uruguay round  and undertook to submit concrete negotiation proposals in the near future. To this we must add the results of the last United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  which the Government of Uruguay considers to be very satisfactory. It is fitting to stress the fact that for the first time a text incorporating within a multilateral framework a series of important conceptual advances regarding external debt  basic commodities and international trade was accepted by consensus. UNCTAD was undoubtedly strengthened by this session  in which its role as a significant forum for the international debate on the development question was reaffirmed.The need to adopt more imaginative viewpoints and concepts of renewal is urgent and essential when dealing seriously with the economic problems which afflict us  and the same need exists in the political sphere.Here  too  the scene is one of light and shade. This year we began our tasks in this area encouraged by several events which we interpret as clear signs that we are on the path towards the solution of some serious problems. We have already mentioned the efforts made by our Central American brothers to put an end to the tragedy that afflicts them  as well as the Organization's efforts in the Iran-Iraq dispute.The recent constructive dialogue between the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic was a contribution to peace and the relaxation of tension in the world. Some disputes continue against all logic  however. One such is that which has afflicted the Middle East for years and already taken an enormous toll in lives and resources  without changing the obstinate stance of the Governments involved  which are determined not to acknowledge the rights of other States and peoples. We restate our conviction that a lasting peace in the region must be based on acknowledgement of the right of Israel to continue to exist as a State  with stable and secure borders  and the right of the Palestinian people freely to decide their destiny according to the resolutions of the world Organization.Many situations which affect peace and security have been created through the influence of external factors which distort the will of peoples. Anything that tends to twist  misrepresent or suppress that will is a violation of the political independence of States  the free choice of peoples and democracy  and should therefore be condemned. That is why our country reiterates its deep concern at the continuance of situations such as those in Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Cyprus and of the intolerable forms of oppression practised in South Africa and Namibia. Similarly  the continuance of artificial political divisions  as in the case of the Korean people  does not contribute to peace.These and other international situations feed the feeling of insecurity and serve as an excuse for large and small countries alike to persist in the absurd arms race  weakening the economies of many of them  to the benefit of the producer and middleman elite.In no other sector is the chasm between technological creativity and political and institutional creativity so deep as in that of war industries. The degree of diversity  sophistication and power achieved by the weapons defies the imagination  while the production of and trade in these weapons continues to increase. Meanwhile  during the past few years disarmament and arms-control initiatives have made no significant progress. Having saturated the planet with enough arms to devastate it several times over  the aim is now to place those weapons in outer space  adding terror to terror and making more acute the collective feeling of impotence.Recently  the great Powers have multiplied their efforts to achieve at least partial results in the negotiations on disarmament and arms control. Last weekend we read with relief and joy that the Governments of the United States and the Soviet Union were on the verge of reaching an agreement on the control of shorthand medium-range missiles. What was said this morning by the President of the United States is certainly encouraging and casts a ray of light in this long tunnel of frustration and failure. The super-Powers  on whose will the continuance of the world as a habitable place depends  must know that the attention and hopes of the entire international community are set on these initiatives and negotiations  and that they are morally and legally bound to intensify the efforts already begun before it is too late. They bear the major responsibility for rescuing the world from the obsession with arms  which has  unfortunately  contaminated the developing countries as well. It is especially in this area that the creativity and good faith of States can play their part.We are not completely satisfied with the results of the Conference on disarmament and development. None the less  it cannot be denied that recognition by almost all the international community of the link between the two is  with the other conclusions  a promising starting-point for future action. A third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament could be an opportunity to revitalize old ideas  propose new ones and adopt procedures to implement them. But such a special session must be called only when we are sure that positive and substantial results will be achieved. We must not let such an opportunity become a mere rhetorical exercise.So long as initiatives regarding general and complete disarmament are not crystallizing  proposals to relieve specific geographic areas from the dangers arising from the use of force have a fundamental role to play in the maintenance of peace and security. Last year  Uruguay supported Brazil's initiative  which resulted in a General Assembly resolution declaring the South Atlantic a zone of peace and co-operation. There is no need to stress how important the South Atlantic region is to Uruguay  not only from a political and strategic point of view but also from an economic and environmental point of view. In Uruguay's judgement  that resolution is only a first step on the basis of which we must draw up a legal statute for the South Atlantic which  taking account in particular of the concerns of the coastal countries  would not only ensure the avoidance of non-peaceful activities in the region or of having it used as a pretext for confrontation and rivalry  but also become an encouraging basis for the development of new manifestations of solidarity and co-operation.But the effective establishment of a zone of peace in the South Atlantic will not be possible while the problem of the Malvinas Islands remains unresolved. Once more  as on previous occasions  Uruguay urges the parties to this dispute to intensify their efforts to resume negotiations to put an end to a situation whose persistence affects the whole of Latin America  and whose final solution must restore the islands to Argentina  which holds legitimate sovereignty over them. Last year  in the same Latin American spirit  we received in our country the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Chile and Bolivia  determined to seek a fair and final solution to the question of Bolivia's outlet to the sea. We sincerely deplore the suspension of those discussions and  in a fraternal spirit  we urge our Chilean and Bolivian brothers to persist in their dialogue  for which purpose we shall always welcome them in our country. We are convinced that dialogue is the only way to put an end to a dispute which  in the interest of all  ought to be resolved.It is our lot to live in a complex and challenging  but none the less fascinating  world.  While dangers and threats thus far unknown to mankind appear ahead of us as a result of intolerance of all kinds and the arms race  the future also offers mankind the hitherto unimagined benefits of modern technological civilization.The task with which this Organization was charged by its Charter  42 years ago  was to manage this world according to principles of equity and justice. To realize that lofty purpose we must all decide with sincere political will to face up to the great points of ambivalence of our world  which are the most disappointing features of our time: At a time when our civilization makes it possible for a minority to attain an unprecedented standard of living  hunger and poverty persist and are increasing for the vast majority.At a time when we are approaching a half century of efforts to achieve international dialogue  we are incapable of overcoming in a spirit of mutual tolerance the violence of fundamentalism in all its forms - racial  religious and national - and of insane and bloody terrorism. At a time when we are adopting charters  treaties and declarations on respect for human rights  flagrant violations of those very rights persist in every corner of the planet  reflecting shamefully on the most precious ethical and political principles of our civilization.At a time when we recognize economic interdependence to be as inescapable asIt is mutually beneficial  we are Incapable of facing together the great imbalance and injustices of international economic relations  and undertaking the adjustment which have so far been focused mainly on the developing countries.At a time when we are advancing along the path of technological progress as brilliant as it is unbridled  we are attacking the environment  thus compromising future life on the planet  as reported so accurately by the World Commission on Environment and Development in its study entitled ""Our Common Future""  which is to be considered at this very Assembly session.At a time when enormous resources are required for the great structural transformation of the developing countries  we continue to spend on weapons in a single year the total value of all third-world external debt.Those are only some of the great points of ambivalence which trouble and challenge mankind. To face them  a commitment to the values of a democratic  pluralist  tolerant society is necessary on the domestic scene  and a commitment to a society based on the principles of dialogue  fairness and co-operation is required on the international scene.Those are the principles by which my Government stands  along with all of Uruguayan society. In 1985 Uruguay recovered its traditional democratic life and made fully effective the operation of its republican institutions  along with all human  civil and political rights  thus achieving national reconciliation and initiating the dynamic activity necessary to bring about the economic and social progress of our .people. As a part of Latin America  Uruguay feels deep solidarity with all countries of the region. We reiterate our integrationist vocation  particularly via-a-vis our neighbours  with which we shall continue to build bridges of political and economic co-operation which  along with strengthening our national identity  further the purposes of democratic consolidation and progress in the entire sub-region.On the international scene  Uruguay  which has always been true to its traditions of respect for and commitment to international law  will continue to do everything in its power to strengthen international dialogue and foster the fulfilment of the principles of the Charter of which it is a signatory. That is the message of my Government and of all of Uruguayan society.That is our position as we come to this Assembly session. We are certain  Mr. President  that as they were under your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  the results of this session  under your wise and inspired guidance  will make a significant contribution to international harmony."
"142",7238,"USA",42,1987,"﻿Let me first welcome the Secretary-General back from his pilgrimage for peace in the Middle East. Hundreds of thousands have already fallen in the bloody conflict between Iran and Iraq. All men and women of goodwill pray that the carnage can soon be stopped  and we pray that the Secretary-General proves to be not only a pilgrim but also the architect of a lasting peace between those two nations. Mr. Secretary-General  the United States supports you  and may God guide you in your labours ahead.Like the Secretary-General  all of us here today are on a kind of pilgrimage. We come from every continent  every race and most religions to this great Hall of hope where  in the name of peace  we practise diplomacy. Now diplomacy  of course  is a subtle and nuance craft - so much so that it is said that when one of the most wily diplomats of the nineteenth century passed away  other diplomats asked  on reports of his death  ""What do you suppose the old fox meant by that?""But true statesmanship requires not merely skill but something greater  something we call vision  a grasp of the present and of the possibilities of the future. I have come here today to map out for you my own vision of the world's future - one  I believe  that  in its essential elements  is shared by all Americans. And I hope those who see things differently will not mind if I say that we in the United States believe that the place to look first for the shape of the future is not in continental masses and sea lanes  although geography is obviously  of great importance. Neither is it in national reserves of blood and iron or on the other hand  of money and industrial capacity  although military and economic strength are also  of course  crucial. We begin with something that is far simpler and yet far more profound - the human heart.All over the world today  the yearnings of the human heart are redirecting in course of international affairs  putting the lie to the myth of materialism and historical determinism. We have only to open our eyes to see the simple aspirations of ordinary people writ large on the record of our times.Last year in the Philippines  ordinary people rekindled the spirit of democracy and restored the electoral process. Some said they had performed a miracle  and  if so  a similar miracle - a transition to democracy - is taking place in the Republic of Korea. Haiti  too  is making a transition. Some despair when these new young democracies face conflicts or challenges  but growing pains are normal in democracies. The United States had them - as has every other democracy on earth.In Latin America  too  one can hear the voices of freedom echo from the pea з and across the plains. It is the song of ordinary people marching  not in uniforms and not in military file  but  rather  one by one in simple  everyday working clothes - marching to the polls. Ten years ago  only a third of the people in La in America and the Caribbean lived in democracies or in countries that were turning to democracy. Today over 90 per cent do.But this world-wide movement to democracy is not the only way in which simple  ordinary people are leading us in this room - we who are said to be the makers of history - leading us Into the future. Around the world  new businesses  new economic growth  new technologies are emerging from the workshops of ordinary people with extraordinary dreams.Here in the United States  entrepreneurial energy - reinvigorated when we cut taxes and regulations - have fuelled the current economic expansion. According to scholars at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  three quarters of the more than 13.5 million new jobs that we have created in this country since the beginning of our expansion rate from businesses with fewer than 100 employees - businesses started by ordinary people who dared to take a chance. And many of our new high technologies were first developed in the garages of fledgling entrepreneurs. Yet America is not the only or perhaps even the best example of the dynamism and dreams that the freeing of markets set free.In India and China  freer markets for farmers have led to an explosion in production. In Africa. Governments are rethinking their policies  and where they ate allowing greater economic freedom to farmers  crop production has improved. Meanwhile  in the newly industrialized countries of the Pacific Rim  free markets in services and manufacturing as well as agriculture have led to a soaring of growth and standards of living. The nations of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Japan  Korea and Taiwan have created the true economic miracle of   the last two decades  and in each of them much of the magic came from ordinary people who succeeded as entrepreneurs.In Latin America  this same lesson of free markets  greater opportunity and growth is being studied and acted on. President Sarney of Brazil spoke for manyothers when he said that ""Private initiative is the engine of economic Development. In Brazil we have learned that every time the state's penetration in the economy increases  our liberty decreases."" Yes  policies that release to flight ordinary people's dreams ate spreading around the world. From Colombia t Turkey to Indonesia  Governments are cutting taxes  reviewing their regulations  and opening opportunities for initiative.There has been much talk in the halls of this building about the ""right to development"". But more and more the evidence is clear that development is not itself a right. It is the product of rights: the right to own property; the right to buy and sell freely; the right to contract; the right to be free of excessive taxation and regulation  of burdensome government. There have been studies that determine that countries with low tax rates have greater growth than those with high rates.We are all familiar with the phenomenon of the ""underground economy"". The scholar Hernando de Soto and his colleagues have examined the situation of one country - Peru - and described an economy of the poor that bypasses crushing taxation and stifling regulation. This ""informal economy""  as the researchers all it  is the principal supplier of many goods and services  and often the only ladder for upward mobility. In the capital city it accounts for almost all public transportation and most street markets. And the researchers concluded that  thanks to the informal economy  ""The poor can work  travel  and have a roof over their heads"". They might have added that  by becoming underground entrepreneurs themselves or by working for them  the poor have become less poor and the nation itself richer.Those who advocate statist solutions to development should take note - the free market is the other path to development and the one true path. And  unlike many other paths  it leads somewhere. It works.So this is where I believe we can find the map to the world's future - in the hearts of ordinary people in their hopes for themselves and their children  and in their prayers as they lay themselves and their families to rest each night. These simple people are the giants of the Earth  the true builders of the world and shapers of the centuries to come. And if Indeed they triumph  as I believe they will  we will at last know a world of peace and freedom  opportunity and hope  and  yes  of democracy - a world in which the spirit of mankind at last conquers the old  familiar enemies of famine  disease  tyranny  and war.This is my vision - America's vision I recognize that some Governments represented in this Hall have other ideas. Some do not believe in democracy or in political  economic  or religious freedom. Some believe in dictatorship - whether by one man  one party  one class  one race  or one vanguard. To those Governments I would only say that the price of oppression is clear. Your economies will fall farther and farther behind. Your people will become more restless. Is it not better to listen to the people's hopes now  rather than their curses later?And yet  despite our differences  there is one common hope that brought us all to make this common pilgrimage - the hope that mankind will one day beat its swords into the hope of peace. In no place on Earth today is peace more in need of friends than in the Middle East. Its people's yearning for peace is growing. The United States will continue to be an active partner in the efforts of the parties to come together to settle their differences and build a just and lasting peace.This month marks the beginning of the eighth year of the Iran-Iraq war. Two months ago the Security Council adopted a mandatory resolution demanding a cease-fire  withdrawal  and negotiations to end the war. The United States fully supports implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  as we support the Secretary-General's recent mission. We welcomed Iraq's acceptance of that resolution  and remain disappointed at Iran's unwillingness to accept it.In that regard  I know that the President of Iran will be addressing representatives tomorrow. I take this opportunity to call upon him clearly and unequivocally to state whether Iran accepts Security Council resolution 598 (1987) or not. If the answer is positive  it would be a welcome step and a major breakthrough. If it is negative  the Council has no choice but rapidly to adopt enforcement measures.For 40 years the United States has made clear its vital interest in the security of the Persian Gulf and the countries that border it. The oil reserves there are of strategic importance to the economies of the free world. We are committed to maintaining the free flow of this oil and to preventing the domination of the region by any hostile Power.We do not seek confrontation or trouble with Iran or anyone else. Our objective is now  and has been at every stage  finding a means to end the war with no victor and no vanquished. The Increase in out naval presence in the Gulf does not favour one side or the other. It is a response to heightened tensions and followed consultations with our friends in the region. When the tension diminishes  so will our presence.The United States is gratified by many recent diplomatic developments - the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  the Arab League's statement at its recent meeting in Tunis  and the Secretary-General's visit. Yet problems remain.The Soviet Union helped in drafting and reaching an agreement on Security Council resolution 598 (1987). But outside the Security Council  the Soviets have acted differently. They called for removal of our navy from the Gulf  where it has been for 40 years. They made the false accusation that somehow the United States - rather than the war itself - is the source of tension in the Gulf. Such statements are not helpful. They divert attention from the challenge facing us all - a just end to the war.The United States hopes the Soviets will join the other members of the Security Council in vigorously seeking an end to a conflict that should never have begun  should have ended long ago  and has become one of the great tragedies of the post-war era.Elsewhere in the region  we see the continuing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. After nearly eight years  a million casualties  nearly 4 million others driven into exile  and more intense fighting than ever  it is time for the Soviet Union to leave.The Afghan people roust have the right to determine their own future free of foreign coercion. There is no excuse for prolonging a brutal war or propping up a regime whose days are clearly numbered. That regime offers political proposals that pretend compromise  but really would ensure the perpetuation of the regime's power. Those proposals have failed the only significant test: they have been rejected by the Afghan people. Every day the resistance grows in strength. It is an indispensable patty In the quest for a negotiated solution. The world community must continue to insist on genuine self-determination prompt and full Soviet withdrawal  and the return of the refugees to their homes in safety and honour. The attempt may be made to pressure a few countries to change their vote this year  but this body# I know  will vote overwhelmingly as every year before  for Afghan independence and freedom.We have noted General Secretary Gorbachev's statement of readiness to withdraw. In April I asked the Soviet Union to set a date this year when this withdrawal would begin. I repeat that request now  in this forum for peace. I pledge that  once the Soviet Union shows convincingly that it is ready for a genuine political settlement  the United States is ready to be helpful.Let me add one final note on this matter. Pakistan  in the face of enormous pressure and intimidation  has given sanctuary to Afghan refugees. We salute the courage of Pakistan and the Pakistani people. They deserve strong support from all of us.Another regional conflict we all know is taking place in Central America - in Nicaragua.To the Sandinista delegation here today I say: Your people know the true nature of your regime. They have seen their liberties suppressed. They have seen the promises of 1979 go unfulfilled. They have seen their real wages and personal income fall by half - yes  half - since 1979  while your Party elite live lives of privilege and luxury.This is why  despite a billion dollars in Soviet-bloc aid last year alone  despite the largest and best equipped army in Central America  you face a popular revolution at home. It is why the democratic resistance is able to operate freely deep in your heartland. But this revolution should come as no surprise to you. I' is only the revolution you promised the people  and that you then betrayed.The goal of United States policy towards Nicaragua is simple. It is the goal of the Nicaraguan people and the freedom fighters as well: it is democracy - real free  pluralistic  constitutional democracy. Understand this: we will not  and the world community will not  accept phoney ""democratisation"" designed to mask the perpetuation of dictatorship.  In this 200th year of our own Constitution  we know that real democracy depends on the safeguards of an institutional structure that prevents a concentration of power. It is that which makes rights secure. The temporary relaxation of controls - which can later be tightened - is not democratisation. Again  to the Sandinistas  I say: we continue to hope that Nicaragua will become part of the genuine democratic transformation that we have seen throughout Central America in this decade. We applaud the principles embodied in the Guatemala agreement  which links the security of the Central American democracies to democratic reform in Nicaragua. Now is the time for you to shut down the military machine that threatens your neighbours and assaults your own people. You must end your stranglehold on internal political activity. You must hold free and fair national elections. The media must be truly free - not censored or	'intimidated or crippled by indirect measures such as the denial of newsprint or threats against journalists or their families. Exiles must be allowed to return  to minister  to live  to work  and to organize politically. Then  when persecution of religion has ended and the jails no longer contain political prisoners  national reconciliation and democracy will be possible.Unless this happens  democratisation will be a fraud. And until it happens  we will press for true democracy by supporting those fighting for it.Freedom in Nicaragua  or Angola  or Afghanistan  or Cambodia  or Eastern Europe  or South Africa or anyplace else on the globe is not just an internal matter. Some time ago the Czech dissident writer  Vaclav Havel  warned the world that""respect for human rights is the fundamental condition and the sole genuine guarantee of true peace"". And Andrei Sakharov  in his Nobel Lecture  said:  ""I am convinced that international confidence  mutual understanding  disarmament  and International security are inconceivable without an open society with freedom of information  freedom of conscience  the right to publish  and the right to travel and choose the country In which one wishes to live.""Freedom serves peace. The quest for peace must serve the cause of freedom. Patient diplomacy can contribute to a world In which both can flourish. We are heartened by new prospects for improvement in East-West and  particularly. United States-Soviet relations.Last week Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze visited Washington for talks with me and with Secretary of State Shultz. We discussed the full range of issues. Including my long-standing efforts to achieve  for the first time  deep reductions in United States and Soviet nuclear arms. It was six years ago  for example  that I proposed the 2ero option for United States and Soviet longer-range intermediate-range nuclear missiles. I am pleased that we have now agreed in principle to a truly historic treaty that will eliminate an entire class of United States and Soviet nuclear weapons. We have also agreed to intensify our diplomatic efforts in all areas of mutual Interest.Towards that end Secretary Shultz and the Foreign Minister will meet again  a month from now  in Moscow  and I will meet again with General Secretary Gorbachev later this fall.We continue to have our differences and probably always will. But that puts a special responsibility on us to find ways - realistic ways - to bring greater stability to our competition and to show the world a constructive example of the value of communication and of the possibility of peaceful solutions to political problems. Here let me add that we seek  through our strategic defence initiative  to find a way to keep the peace through relying on defence - not offence - for deterrence and for eventually rendering ballistic missiles obsolete. The strategic defence Initiative has greatly enhanced the prospects for real arms reduction. It is a crucial part of our efforts to ensure a safer world and a more stable strategic balance.We will continue to pursue the goal of arms reduction  particularly the goal that the General Secretary and I agreed upon: a 50 per cent reduction in our respective strategic nuclear arms. We will continue to press the Soviets for more constructive conduct in the settling of regional conflicts. We look to the Soviets to honour the Helsinki accords. We look for greater freedom for the Soviet peoples within their country/ more people-to-people exchanges with our country and Soviet recognition in practice of the right of freedom of movement.We look forward to a time when things we now regard as sources of friction and even danger can become examples of co-operation between ourselves and the Soviet Union. For instance  I have proposed a collaboration to reduce the barriers between East and West in Berlin  and more broadly in Europe as a whole. Let us work together for a Europe in which force or the threat of force  whether in the form of walls or of guns is no longer an obstacle to free choice by individuals and whole nations  I have also called for more openness in the flow of information from the Soviet Union about its military forces  policies and programmes so that our negotiations about arms reduction can proceed with greater confidence.We hear much about changes in the Soviet Union. We are intensely interested in these changes. We hear the world glasnost which is translated as ""openness"" in English. Openness is a broad term  it means the free  unfettered flow of information  ideas and people  it means political and intellectual liberty in all forms. We hope  for the sake of the peoples of the USSR  that such changes will come. And we hope  for the sake of peace  that it will include a foreign policy that  respects the freedom and independence of other peoples.No place should be better suited for discussions of peace than this Hall. The first Secretary-General  Trygve Lie  said of the United Nations:""With the danger of fire  and in the absence of an organized fire department  it is only common sense for the neighbours to join in setting up their own fire brigades.""Joining together to drown the flames of war - this  together with a universal declaration of human rights  was the founding ideal of the United Nations. It is our continuing challenge to ensure that the United Nations lives up to these hopes.As the Secretary-General noted some time ago  the risk of anarchy in the world has increased because the fundamental rules of the United Nations Charter have been violated. The General Assembly has repeatedly acknowledged this with regard to the occupation of Afghanistan  The Charter has a concrete practical meaning today because it touches on all the dimensions of human aspiration that I mentioned earlier: the yearning for democracy and freedom  for global peace and for prosperity.That is why we must protect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from being debased as it was through the infamous ""Zionism is racism"" resolution. We cannot permit attempts to control the media and promote censorship under the ruse of a so-called new world information order. We must work against efforts to introduce contentious and non-relevant issues into the work of the specialized and technical agencies where we seek progress on urgent problems  from terrorism to drug trafficking to nuclear proliferation  which threaten us all. Such efforts corrupt the Charter and weaken this Organization.There have been important administrative and budget reforms. They have helped. The United States is committed to restoring its contribution as reforms progress. But there is still much to do. The United Nations was built on great dreams and great ideals. Sometimes it has strayed. It is time for it to come home. It was Dag Hammarskjold who said:""The end of all political effort must be the well-being of the individual in a life of safety and freedom.""Should this not be our credo in the years ahead?I have spoken today of a vision and of the obstacles to its realization. More than a century ago a young Frenchman  Alexis de Tocqueville  visited America.After that visit he predicted that the two great Powers of the future world would be  on the one hand  the United States  which would be built  as he said  ""by the ploughshare""; and  on the other hand  Russia  which would go forward  again as he said  ""by the sword"". Yet  need it be so? Cannot swords be turned to ploughshares? Can we and all nations not live in peace?In our obsession with antagonisms of the moment  we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps we need some outside  universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world. And yet  I ask  is not an alien force already among us? What could be more alien to the universal aspirations of our peoples than war and the threat of war?Two centuries ago  in a hall much smaller than this one  in Philadelphia  Americans met to draft a constitution. In the course of their debates  one of them said that the new Government  if it was to rise high  must be built on the broadest base - the will and consent of the people. And so it was. And so It has been.My message today is that the dreams of ordinary people reach to astonishing heights. If we diplomatic pilgrims are to achieve equal altitudes  we must build all we do on the full breadth of humanity's will and consent and the full expanse of the human heart."
"143",7308,"VCT",42,1987,"﻿Permit me first to congratulate you   Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly  I am confident that your skills and ability  as exemplified by your illustrious career  will lead this session to significant results.I wish to take this opportunity to express my delegations appreciation of your predecessor/ Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  for the effective manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the forty-first session of the General Assembly..We wish also to express our support for the untiring efforts of our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  sometimes despite serious setbacks  to find solutions to the many conflicts in the world today. No lasting solutions can be achieved without a genuine effort of peaceful co-operation by all United Nations Member States.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small eastern Caribbean State. Like many other States represented in this Assembly  my country is a product of the post-war decolonization process. We gained our independence in 1979 and were admitted to the United Nations in 1980. Our view of the world and the relations we have with other States have been fashioned by our history  our present circumstances and our perceptions of the world around us.If representatives can picture in their minds a small  tropical island 133 square miles in area and approximately 40 other smaller islands stretching for 100 miles along the outer rim of the Caribbean Basin  they may be able to get an idea of the country I represent. The narrow coastal plain and interior mountain valleys on Saint Vincent  together with six of the Grenadine Islands  support a population of 110 000 vincentians. They should consider also a country in which half the population is under the age of 21  where unemployment is currently at about 30 per cent of the labour force and which three times during the past two years has seen its major export crops destroyed by tropical storms; a country without an international airport to service its most important sector  tourism. Those are some basic facts about my country.Yet  the records of this Organization will be found to contain hardly any pleas from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for special attention. Forming part of the English-speaking Caribbean  a region characterized by long democratic traditions and the rule of law  we are a people which emerged just over two years ago from the institution of slavery and the plantation system  an even worse form of apartheid than that practised in South Africa today. Cut adrift from the metropolitan Power by the stormy winds of decolonization and without adequate preparation or economic safeguards  we have been forced to draw upon our own spiritual reserves and resourcefulness to survive.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is governed at the present time by the New Democratic Party  under the leadership of our Prime Minister  the Right Honourable James Pitz-Allen Mitchell. In presenting the annual budget in Parliament two months ago  the Prime Minister analysed the problems facing the country in the year ahead and concluded his address as follows;""my Government is anticipating that the new year will be a better one for the people of this country. With it will come new challenges and major decisions  but we are a country of bright  energetic and ambitious people and I am confident that the right decisions will be taken at the right time."" Notwithstanding the difficulties we face as a country  there are occasional rays of hope  such as  for example  the International Monetary Fund's June 1987 consultation report on Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  which states; ""In the last few years Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has achieved a major improvement in public finances  which has facilitated a marked recovery in the financial position of the State-owned National Commercial Bank and a considerable strengthening in the country's external position.""""Peace and Justice"" is the motto which Saint Vincent and the Grenadines adopted over a century ago. It is not surprising therefore that the United Nations  with the Charter as its centre-piece  holds special significance for my Government and people  for the ideals which the Charter seeks to promote are  indeed  peace and justice. This Organization  is one born of bitter wartime experiences and human suffering. Coming into existence 43 years ago  it then represented  and still embodies today  man's highest aspirations and goals. In the Charter are crystallized mankind's highest ideals  such as the sanctity of life  the dignity and worth of the individual  peace  freedom and social and economic justice. The Charter of the United Nations is the outstanding achievement of our century  and my delegation believes that  now as we approach the twenty-first century  man's best hope of survival lies in his ability to transform the Charter from a mere legal instrument into a living and dynamic principle enshrined in our legal systems and in our hearts.Peace is a basic condition necessary for achieving the fruits of civilization. To the degree that the arras race and geopolitical and regional conflicts and tensions exist  to that same degree we fail to achieve the goals of progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. There is a direct relationship between peace and development and  as a corollary  between disarmament and development. Not many deny this.My delegation  like all other delegations represented in this Assembly  therefore welcomes the recent announcement by the United States of America and the Soviet Union of an agreement in principle for the global elimination of land-based Intermediate nuclear weapons. We hope that this historic agreement between the super-Powers represents the first sign on the horizon of a new day in which there will be complete elimination of all nuclear missiles  both intermediate and strategic  and that it will usher in an era of peace on this planet so satiated with war.Notwithstanding this un-seasonal thaw in relations between the super-Powers  the international situation remains very volatile and explosive. It is imperative that the present momentum be maintained in order to bring about a more lasting easing of global tension.In my own region  the signing of the Guatemala Agreement in August of this year by the five Presidents of Central America is a most welcome and encouraging development. The Costa Rican initiative based on the invaluable work of the Contadora and its Support Groups deserves our fullest support.My country also welcomes the Cartagena Protocol signed last year in the Republic of Colombia  which opens the way for the Caribbean countries of Guyana and Belize to become members of the Organization of American States.The war in the Gulf region between Iran and Iraq cries out for a peaceful solution. We support the Secretary-General in his efforts to find such a solution and we call on Iran and Iraq to heed the call of the international community and abide by the terms of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) for a cease-fire and to put an end eventually to the senseless slaughter.My delegation notes the increased interest on the part of the international community in the idea of a conference on the Middle East. The basis of a Middle East settlement already exists in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) . This must include the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to exist within secure boundaries; the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including the right to establish a State of their own; and the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967.Afghanistan and Kampuchea still remain under foreign occupation. My delegation supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to find a solution to the problem of Afghanistan. We are also encouraged by the increasing contacts and ongoing dialogue between the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and Viet Nam and the various groups in Kampuchea. Afghanistan and Kampuchea  both of them small countries  still remain the victims of aggression and illegal occupation by larger  more powerful neighbours. This is unacceptable to the international community  and my delegation joins in the international consensus calling for withdrawal of all foreign troops from those countries. The Afghans and Kampucheans have the right to determine their destinies free from foreign interference or coercion.My delegation sees the need for increasing dialogue between North and South Korea. Only dialogue and negotiation will lead to a reconciliation of the views of the two parties. It is imperative that the deeply rooted mistrust between the two Koreas be replaced with understanding and good will  which are surely not beyond the capacity of a people with different ideologies but whose culture is more than 5000 years old.We support the efforts of the Secretary-General in helping the two Cypriot communities to find a just solution to the problem of Cyprus without foreign intervention.We believe also that a negotiated settlement is the only acceptable solution to the question of the Malvinas Islands.There can be no lasting peace in a world without development or a world in which economic inequalities exist. The current global recession has created a number of problems which are very destabilizing to developing countries  especially to small open economies like those of the island States of the eastern Caribbean. The international economy is going through a period of deep structural change  and solutions will have to be found for thorny problems such as the debt crisis  unbalanced terms of trade  international monetary instability  and unacceptably high levels of unemployment in developing countries. There is need for an integrated approach to those problems. The solutions adopted must be such that all countries  large and small  might benefit from the new technologies and possibilities of our times. Encouraging signs in this direction are the recently concluded seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Uruguay Round launched in Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986.A strange anomaly of our time is the global waste of precious resources on armaments while millions everywhere suffer from illiteracy and poverty and die from malnutrition and starvation. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development held in New York in August and September of this year reminded us of these hard realities. This is a moral problem that strikes at the very roots of human survival. Instead of expenditures on arms  there is an urgent need to allocate these resources to the eradication of hunger and disease  including the deadly threat of AIDS (acquired immune-deficiency syndrome)  and to finding solutions to pressing problems relating to the environment. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will support all initiatives at the current session of the General Assembly aimed at putting these issues into perspective.There is a new initiative among the eastern Caribbean States for political and economic integration  in an attempt to harness our very limited resources to provide a better standard of living for our peoples. Serious consideration is being given at the moment to unification as a strategy for development in the subregion. The advantages to be derived from such a union in terms of increasing returns within a widening scope of activities are obvious. The true goal of human endeavour is development and happiness. All our efforts at the national and international levels should have as their aim  as stated in the Charter of the United Nations  the reaffirmation of our faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.No greater denial or abuse of these rights exists today than that inherent in the monstrous practice of apartheid by the racist regime in South Africa. This is an issue which continues to threaten international peace and security. South Africa has no intention of dismantling the immoral system of apartheid. It has intensified its campaign of terror and brutality against the oppressed masses within its own borders and in surrounding States. The situation is becoming more and more explosive. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines joins with the international community in calling for comprehensive  mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter.The Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation equally condemns the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa and calls for the immediate independence of Namibia through implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).My delegation condemns all assaults on the rights of man  whether social or political in nature  and condemns all forms of intolerance whether they are based on religion  colour or class.Finally  my delegation congratulates you  Mr. President  on the success of this debate and pledges its fullest support to you for the remainder of the present session of the General Assembly. We should free ourselves from the notion that the United Nations has failed; it has registered considerable success in a variety of areas of international co-operation. While it cannot perhaps negotiate for the world  it can help the world to negotiate. History has saddled us with a heavy burden and responsibility  and as we look towards the twenty-first century  we should redouble our efforts to achieve the goals and ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter of peace  development  happiness and love for all mankind. The task before us is far too great to waste any more time. We must act now."
"144",7355,"VEN",42,1987,"﻿Mr. President  on behalf of the people and Government of Venezuela  I am pleased to convey to you my sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Your well-known personal Qualities and your wide experience as a diplomat are guarantees that in this new stage of General Assembly activities we shall achieve fruitful results.May I also express Venezuela's appreciation of the outstanding work accomplished by Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh  the outgoing President of the Assembly. His valuable contribution was felt in many fields and his actions bear witness to his support of the principles which guide the United Nations.It is with particular pleasure that I also greet most respectfully the Secretary-General  Javier Perez de Cuellar  an eminent Latin American. His persistent efforts on behalf of international peace and harmony and the intellect and tenacity of which he has given proof in the discharge of his lofty functions have won him broad and open recognition.Once again I come to this forum of universal dialogue to reaffirm the commitment of Venezuela to the fundamental causes of peace and understanding among peoples  which are the raison d'etre of this Organization. I come to this Assembly in the conviction that in times of great economic crisis  extreme political dilemmas and threats to peace the United Nations is strengthened as the undeniable contemporary chosen place for negotiating solutions to the major problems which affect the international community. Our message is therefore one of unequivocal support for its endeavours and labours.This assures me that I am interpreting the unanimous conviction of Venezuelans in reaffirming unambiguously that Venezuela has faith In the United Nations  in the motives that brought it into being and in the effectiveness of its ideals. We are firmly on the side of those who strive to strengthen It. The satisfaction of many basic expectations depends on Its vigour. We cannot allow the prospects for collective well-being to suffer for the sake of subordinate Interests. The time has come for concrete Initiatives and results  with a clear sense of the responsibilities at stake. The United Nations can do It. We are certain of that.I should like to put before this General Assembly some views which seem to me to be basic to the present International situation  together with a broad outline of the foreign policy of my Government  which is the Government of the Venezuelan people. At the outset I must refer to the challenge of peace at the global and the regional level. The dangers which beset the human race in this nuclear era are well known. We are also familiar with the serious obstacles that lie in the path of a just and lasting peace. Confronted with these barriers  it is natural that pessimism often prevails in prognostications on the subject of peace and its future.We cannot  of course  deceive ourselves. While it is true that since what is called the Second World War no new general conflagration has broken out  it is also true that the current ""nuclear peace"" is less a voluntary arrangement - which  of course  is not reassuring either - than the result of implacable rivalry for power and dominance  spurred by fear  mistrust and the quest for hegemony.These facts cannot be concealed  but it would also be wrong not to point out some positive signs which show that our wills are not yet governed by irrationality. We realize that arms control and disarmament are not in themselves guarantees of peace  but there is no doubt that they make it clear that there is a desire for peace. In this respect  we welcome the important steps which the two great nuclear Powers have been taking to eliminate medium- and short-range missiles in Europe.Venezuela wishes its voice to be heard in categorical support for this and other initiatives designed to lessen in some measure the crushing burden of the nuclear-arms race  I think it is necessary  and also fair  to recognize the positive intentions which serve to motivate the leaders of the great Powers in the negotiations under way. Let us hope that this spirit of compromise will be the prelude to speedier and more far-reaching advances on the road to arms control and nuclear disarmament. In these times  when the danger of self-destruction is looming with threatening clarity  we cannot rely on the balance of nuclear terror as an element for peace. We must go beyond that and support peace on the basis of the values of international tolerance and understanding.A few days ago the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development took place. It confirmed once again the obvious fact that in the midst of the economic-financial crisis which the developing countries face it has now become Imperative that measures be taken which will make possible a re-channelling of substantial financial resources  which would undoubtedly facilitate the solution of some of the grave problems confronting our countries.Any progress in the field of disarmament will be a welcome step towards a goal which we defend and will continue to defend resolutely. We therefore once again urge the super-Powers to accelerate and broaden negotiations in the field of nuclear disarmament. Similarly  as we reiterated at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  another objective which we shall not renounce is the conclusion of a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. We are pleased to see the progress that is being made on this subject in the ongoing negotiations.In accordance with the principles of this Organization  we have exercised our responsibility as a member of the Security Council during three terms in the course of our 30 years of democratic life. Our current mandate as a non-permanent member of the Council  the primary organ of the United Nations  where we have at all times endeavoured to play a conciliatory and constructive role in the promotion of world peace  ends in December.My country will continue to pursue its recognized peaceful calling and course in all relevant parts of the world. We firmly and loyally support the settlement of disputes between States by peaceful means  including direct negotiations  without pressure or unacceptable deadlines. We advocate the use of reasonable. It Is In this spirit that we have taken part as a member of the Contadora Group in the resolute quest for peace in the Central American region. After four years of arduous work aimed at achieving a peaceful  negotiated solution to the Central American crisis  we are beginning to see some results which allow us to be reasonably optimistic.The agreements reached in Guatemala by the Presidents of the five Central American Republics were a substantial advance and justify our referring to the obstacles that have been overcome. This is an effort made by the Central American countries themselves  which should make the agreed procedure genuine and trustworthy.I wish to emphasize that the International Verification and Follow-up Commission provided for in the Guatemala agreement was established in Caracas a few weeks ago. The members of the Commission are the Foreign Ministers of the Contadora Group  of the Support Group and of Central America  and the Secretaries-General of the Organization of American States and of the United Nations.We are  of course  aware that in this whole process we need the co-operation of countries with links with and interests in the region. All our efforts could be impaired and peace in Central America made impossible without a positive contribution from these elements. We also recognize that this conflict  like many others we have witnessed and are witnessing  is to a large extent the result of underlying socio-economic injustices  which have to be addressed. These are fundamental aspects and the Contadora and Support Groups take them into account in their true dimensions. Thus it was decided at the Caracas meeting to take the necessary steps immediately to prepare a structure and an instrument for an emergency programme of international technical and economic co-operation for the benefit of the countries of the region. It was also agreed that work would be begun as soon as possible by the international community on measures to implement the programme. This is an important requirement.The continuing negotiations and the political will constantly evinced in the joint action of the countries of the Contadora Group  enhanced by the addition of the countries of the Support Group  have led to the accumulation of a wealth of useful experience  prompting the eight countries to establish a permanent mechanism for consultations and concerted political actions. This was set up in Rio de Janeiro in December 1986.This action is in line with our purpose of strengthening  organizing systematically and harmonizing political action by participating Governments  by means of regular consultations on matters which affect or interest our countries  in the context of increasing Latin American unity. We are also prompted by the determination to secure and strengthen democratic and pluralist processes on our continent. We have not entered into competition with organizations and forums in our regional area  nor do we intend to do so.As a step forward in this process  the eight Presidents of the consultation mechanism have decided to meet in Mexico at the end of next November to decide on specific objectives which will contribute to a broader understanding among the Governments and peoples of the Latin American region.The trend towards democracy in Latin America has fortunately received a great impetus in recent years. Nevertheless  we must reaffirm our conviction that there is a close connection between international security  democratic stability and the socio-economic development of our countries. The survival of democracy has much to do with the capacity of a system based on freedom to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of its people to well-being. We know full well that the primary obligation in meeting the challenges of development rests on our own shoulders. But this in no way diminishes the responsibility which the industrialized world shares and the contribution which it should make in the struggle against protectionism and in the sensible management of the debt problem in such a way as not to curtail our prospects of socio-economic progress and political stability.If we are sincere - and history will not forgive us if we are not - we must recognize that the protectionist race in which some developed countries are engaged and the problem of the external debt and the rise in interest rates  which have recently been dangerously accentuated  are two scourges that also have sinister implications for world peace.No viable solution has yet been found to the external debt problem  the solution of which has so far been approached without regard to any historical perspective. Instead it has been dealt with simply as a financial question  and the arrangements necessary to settle once and for all a crisis which affects both international banking and the development of peoples have simply been postponed. Even more alarming is the fact that increasing limitations are being placed on the debtor countries' capacity to meet the basic needs of their peoples. This one-sided and selfish approach undoubtedly creates deep divisions in international economic relations and jeopardizes social peace in the world. We have been asked to be patient and make sacrifices  and we have demonstrated patience and made sacrifices so as to avert an international financial collapse and win time in seeking a concerted and shared solution to the Indebtedness problem. But our attitude has been ignored and misinterpreted. A political dialogue has become more difficult  the conditions set by the international financial community have become more severe  and our ability to honour our international commitments by sharing in international trade has been restricted  it is therefore imperative - this bears repetition - to hold a broad and sincere dialogue between creditors and debtors  on the basis of co-responsibility and the right to develop.I am saying this with the authority which Venezuela has by having honoured its obligations and negotiated the restructuring of its debt in a framework of moderation and understanding  and as a warning in the face of a crisis which  because it was postponed without any effort to deal with the root of the problem  might assume an even more acute form.The protectionism of the industrialized countries - due in large measure to a lack of discipline in the management of their domestic economies - represents a new  fundamental and unfair - indeed abusive - restriction on opportunities for the developing countries to maintain normal relations with the .international economic community. Through all kinds of mechanisms  crude and subtle  our products' access to international markets is being hampered  which in turn prevents us from adopting development strategies based on a large share in the world economy. While the rules of international trade are being side-stepped  new ones are being devised which ignore the needs of the developing countries  with no regard for the consequences to the stability and evolution of international relations.As a result of this lack of perspective  the poor countries are now in the absurd situation of sending net transfers of resources to the rich countries  which  in practical terms  means  greater poverty  deeper inequalities and fewer possibilities of maintaining a dialogue and institutional stability.From every point of view  it is necessary to support negotiating endeavours so as to find better solutions for the problems mentioned. But it is also necessary to avert the risk that the developing countries remain on the sidelines of the far-reaching changes that are now taking place - among other reasons because of innovations in technology  production and international trade.Unless international co-operation fills this gap we all run the risk of projecting into the future an international economy compartmentalized into unrelated blocs or  what would be even worse  integrated on the basis of dependent relationships  the characteristics and effects of which would doubtless be contrary to the purpose and to the essence of this Organization. We must therefore remember that we have pending on the agenda the mandate for the start of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development  which should be revised and ratified in the light of present circumstances  including the results of the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII)  which met in Geneva last July.That Conference was able to hold a constructive dialogue among all regional groups on the subject of the reactivation of development  growth and international trade through multilateral co-operation. This is very important) it is one of the surest steps taken steps taken so far to solve the problems raised.In its conclusions  we note that it went beyond a diagnosis of the international economic situation and  in the measures and policies recommended by consensus  the Conference made it possible for UNCTAD  as the principal institution in the United Nations system in matters of economic development  to resume  at least in part  its proper role in multilateral economic politics. We therefore trust that UNCTAD VII will mark the end of the process of debilitation and of the disagreements to which UNCTAD has been subjected. If UNCTAD has proved anything  it has been its relevance as a forum for the formulation and negotiation of policies and measures regarding the problems of international economic relations and economic development. Today we have a better perception of the problems  their scope and implications  of the positions and prospects for which they are managed  as well as of the directions that need to be taken for their solution.In connection with the growing interdependence of all our countries  my Government wishes to make a very special mention of the report entitled ""Our Common Future""  prepared by the World Commission on the Environment and Development  an organization presided over by the Prime Minister of Norway  Mrs. Gro Harlem Bruntland  and whose final report has been submitted to this Assembly for consideration.The diagnosis  conclusions and guidelines of that valuable work have been closely scrutinized in ray country. Venezuela's traditional position  both at the national level and in the international forums dealing with the study of environmental problems  has been to defend development in harmony with a balanced ecology  of which man is an integral part and without which his very existence could be threatened. We welcome the publication of this brilliant and useful work and urge that it be debated with a creative intent for the best interests of man and his future.I should also like to refer to the phenomenon of international trade in toxic and dangerous wastes. It is scandalous that this should exist and that the disparities in technology  progress  in the legal infrastructure and control are so abused as to make many developing countries the dumping ground of the scum of industrial activity. This situation requires thorough study and regulation at the multilateral level. Venezuela will support every effort aimed at guaranteeing that by the beginning of 1989 the international community will be in a position to approve a world-wide convention on the control of cross-border movements of dangerous wastes. .In the meantime  the Government of Venezuela has decided to adopt regulatory provisions to prevent its territory from becoming the recipient of toxic wastes.I must also reaffirm  with utmost force and urgency  that at times when we are busy solving pressing problems  we neglect what is perhaps one of the greatest dangers for mankind: the gradual breakdown of the environmental eco-system which is nevertheless our main source of sustenance and life. We therefore maintain that at all levels of activity of the United Nations system  as well as of all other sub-regional  regional and international organs  a greater awareness should be fostered of the close link between economic development and environmental problems  as well as of their long-term effects. It is urgent to ensure the quality of life for generations to come. Accordingly  we support with keen interest the holding  this session  of a plenary meeting devoted exclusively to items pertaining to the environment and development.Venezuela is attentively following the process of reviewing the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations  as called for in resolution 41/213  as well as an in-depth study of the intergovernmental structure of the United Nations and of its functions in the economic and social field  now underway in an ad hoc committee of the Economic and Social Council. This process  which is intended to improve the United Nations system  should not  however  affect the essential functions  mandates and programmes of the Organization. As we see it  there is nothing whatever that can justify depriving the Organization of the budgetary resources which are mandatory under the Charter  nor for compelling it to dismantle its infrastructure and programmes because of delays and failures to comply with financial obligations. Such an attitude is inadmissible  the more so if it proceeds from contributors with a high level of responsibility towards the Organization.The Government of Venezuela  even in the face of a difficult situation as regards its exports earnings and of countless economic and social needs  has made it a point of honour to comply fully with its obligations towards this Organization  Almost all Member countries have had the same attitude. We can only trust that the so-called United Nations financial crisis  the origin of which is well known  will be overcome by full compliance with the obligations we all undertook on becoming Members of this Organization.One of the basic items that has figured prominently in our debates is the battle we are waging to eradicate the grave scourge of the production  consumption  abuse and illicit traffic of drugs.At the International Conference held in Vienna in June last  important steps were taken to draft measures for International co-operation' in this field  where the need for concerted action by all countries Is becoming Increasingly evident. The phenomenon of cross-border drug trafficking cannot be defeated by one country alone. It must be addressed on all fronts: domestic  bilateral and multilateral. The Vienna Conference succeeded in producing two important documents in this direction  that is  the Declaration and the broad and multidisciplinary Plan of Action  which are before us as instruments of undeniable value to guide and harmonize actions by States and by international organizations in the crusade against drugs. On the other hand  as a measure to supplement the efforts of the international community in this direction  Venezuela  a resolute pioneer in this struggle  will steadfastly pursue its action within the United Nations  so that we may as soon as possible conclude the convention against the Illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances  the initial draft of which the Venezuelan delegation submitted to this Assembly in 1984. The work done so far leads us to be optimistic  but it is obvious that in this field - the battle against what I have not hesitated to call the ""Trojan Horse"" of our civilization - much remains to be done  particularly in those countries that provide the biggest markets for this fiendish consumption. Not to face this aspect of the problem decisively would be suicidal. The war against drugs must be global  at every stage  lest we be defeated.Once again we must refer to the grave conflicts prevailing in southern Africa. It is intolerable that  after long decades of debates and decisions taken both by the Security Council and by this Assembly  the colonialism and racism imposed by the ruling minority in South Africa should persist at all costs.Once again we urge South Africa to comply fully with Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978)   thus leading to the prompt independence of Namibia  as decided by the international community.Venezuela attaches particular importance to its relations with African countries. With them we wish to pursue our efforts in the common struggle for the final eradication of apartheid and the defeat of colonialism reigning in Namibia  One of the issues the Organization has been dealing with for decades is the Middle East conflict  a constant concern of the entire international community. We express the hope that it may be possible to arrive at a meeting of minds which will enable progress to be made towards a negotiated  just and lasting solution in that important region of the world. In this respect we support the Secretary-General's efforts aimed at convening a peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned.In the same context  we are gravely concerned about the persistent tension and armed confrontations between Iran and Iraq - countries with which Venezuela maintains cordial and important relations. We hope that this long war  which has engendered such widespread destruction  will soon be ended thus averting the implicit danger of a widening of the conflict.The existence of this Organization  the continuing validity of its noble principles and ideals and its broad and diverse action in many different aspects of international life - all bear eloquent witness to Its role and what it can accomplish.There is no doubt that after this already lengthy road of 42 years of United Nations existence many expectations remain unrealised  but action on many others is on course and moving confidently into the future. In these times of supreme challenge our Organization urges us to strengthen it and give it our most resolute support.We earnestly hope that the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly will be reflected in effective and fruitful results that will promote harmony and progress for all peoples  within a balanced world order where genuine and total peace prevails  free from any restrictions. That is what the yearning for justice of universal man still demands."
"145",7394,"VNM",42,1987,"﻿Comrade President  the delegation of Viet Nam wishes to express its warm congratulations to you  as representative of the fraternal German Democratic Republic  on your election to the presidency of this forty-second session of the General Assembly. We are confident that  with your talent and experience  you will guide our deliberations to a fruitful conclusion  marking a new evolution in United Nations activities in response to the demands of the present world situation. On this occasion my delegation would like  through you  to convey its warmest greetings to the fraternal people of the German Democratic Republic  whose great accomplishments in all spheres have more and more enhanced their fatherland's stature in the international arena and made their country an important factor for peace and peaceful coexistence in Europe.As a result of the birth 70 years ago of the first socialist State in the world  international relations of a new kind have emerged  together with the objective need for peaceful coexistence among countries with different socio-political systems. World history for the past seven decades  and particularly since the Second World War  has been one of a strenuous and complex struggle for peace and peaceful coexistence in the world. In the wake of the stormy years of cold war and attempts in recent years to revive a cold war atmosphere that threaten to drive mankind to the brink of nuclear annihilation  never has the aspiration of nations to live in peace and peaceful coexistence welled up so powerfully as today.Peaceful coexistence is an objective law of our times. We live today in an interdependent world where  under the impact of the scientific and technological revolution. States are confronted with a host of urgent major problems that they cannot solve on their own. In such a world  dialogue instead of confrontation  and co-operation instead of enmity  in order to achieve peaceful coexistence among countries with different socio-political systems  have become a necessary trend of our times.We are at present witnessing a promising evolution in the world situation in the direction of dialogue and peaceful coexistence. General Secretary Gorbachev's well-known initiatives have given a strong impetus to the process of easing tensions  driving back the danger of nuclear war and strengthening world peace and security. The recent Soviet-American agreement on the elimination of medium-range missiles and on the holding this fall of the third summit meeting between General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan constitutes an important step forward on the road leading to a reduced risk of nuclear extermination and an improved international political atmosphere. The meeting between President Honaker of the German Democratic Republic and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of the Federal Republic of Germany marked a new advance in the endeavour to build relations based on dialogue  mutual understanding and co-operation between the two German States  in consonance with the spirit of the 1975 Helsinki Act  which was reaffirmed at the 1986 Stockholm Conference.In spite of those encouraging signs  which have to some extent improved the overall world outlook  factors causing tension still prevail. By intensifying the arms race  especially the nuclear arms race  both on Earth and in space  in the hope of regaining their lost military superiority  those most hawkish forces which hanker for an historically irretrievable past still represent a defiant challenge to humanity.In the face of such dangerous  adventurous schemes and deeds  an imperative for each and every nation is to persevere in acting resolutely for the safeguard of peace and the establishment of peaceful coexistence.Never before has the world been the scene of such a vast mass movement for world peace as in recent years. True to its lofty ideals  the Non-Aligned Movement has grown into a significant component of this struggle. Nor have initiatives in response to the exacting demands of the nuclear and space age  and out of a high sense of responsibility towards the fate of mankind  ever elicited such prompt and wide approval and support from the international community as today. I refer to the Harare appeal issued by the eighth summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement; the Joint Declaration by the Heads of State or Government of India  Sweden  Greece  Tanzania  Mexico and Argentina; and the New Delhi Declaration on the principles of a nuclear-free and non-violent world. I also have in mind the comprehensive programme set forth on 15 January 1986 with a view to eliminating nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction before mankind enters its third millennium  as well as ensuing initiatives aimed at making a reality of that programme; the initiative regarding a comprehensive international system of security put forth at the forty-first session of the General Assembly; General Secretary Gorbachev's 28 July 1986 Vladivostok Declaration on establishing a system of peace and security in Asia and the Pacific; the initiative for the signing of a treaty on the non-use of force or the threat of force among States of Asia and the Pacific; and the proposals for setting up nuclear-free zones in Africa  the Mediterranean  Scandinavia  the South Pacific  South-East Asia and the Korean Peninsula.By dint of their tireless exertion  the forces of peace have made a decisive impact on the atmosphere of dialogue and detente in the world. The present situation calls for a new effort on the part of the world community in order to consolidate and build upon the gains achieved on the long road leading to a firm peace on our planet.Peace is an indispensable prerequisite for development. Conversely  as long as poverty and backwardness continue to exist on earth  instability can hardly be avoided. At present the world economy  and more particularly the economies of the developing countries  are beset with extremely serious difficulties. The gap between the rich and the poor is steadily widening  with the per capita income of developed countries 12 times that of developing nations. The letter's external debt now exceeds 3öS 1 trillion. Primary commodity prices have fallen to their lowest level in the last 50 years. Balances of payments are plagued by acute deficits. Several developing countries are standing on the verge of economic collapse. In our interdependent world such a collapse would affect to no small extent the whole world economic system. In view of this situation  priorities at this forty-second session have to be based on ensuring long-term objectives  namely  the reform of international economic relations so as to move towards a new international economic order and an international system of economic security  and pressing immediate demands such as the burning issues of indebtedness  money and finance  as well as trade. All this requires from the international community  and in particular from developing countries  the most United and resolute action.While the wholesome breeze of dialogue and détente has begun to blow away the dreadful spectre of a nuclear catastrophe in various regions of the world  the efforts of nations to tally their forces in order together to settle  through dialogue  problems facing individual countries as well as whole regions have come up against major obstacles. Forces that are wont to look upon various parts of the world as their ""backyard"" and as ""areas of vital interest"" to them  are increasing their aid to their surrogates and other actions such as economic blockade  embargo and political isolation aimed at undermining and countering the peoples' struggle to achieve and safeguard their independence  to the detriment of peace and stability in various regions of the world.In southern Africa  the apartheid regime  confident in the protection of some imperialist and reactionary forces  still persists strong-headedly  while in the throes of agony  in its bloody repression of the struggle waged by the South African people under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and by the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). At the same time the Pretoria regime undertakes acts of aggression and destabilization against neighbouring countries  especially Angola and Mozambique. Now more than ever before the world community needs to extend to the just struggle of the peoples of South Africa  Namibia and the front-line States the most resolute and powerful support in order to bring about the prompt eradication of apartheid  that stain on human civilization.In Central America  the Republic of Cuba  the first revolutionary State in the Western hemisphere  has weathered innumerable hardships and trials resulting from the fierce opposition of its foes and has achieved many accomplishments in all spheres. The revolutions in Nicaragua and El Salvador are still standing firm on their soil and growing with every passing day. Thanks to the considerable efforts exerted by Nicaragua  the Contadora Group and the Lima Support Group  important progress has been made in the peace process in the region with the signing of the Act on the establishment of a stable and lasting peace in Central America at the summit conference of the five Central American States. This is an important document reflecting the earnest aspirations to peace of the peoples of that region and the overall trend of the world situation today.Tension continues to prevail in the Middle East as a result of Israel's policies of aggression and expansion. We condemn these policies and extend our vigorous support to the just struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples for the realization of their fundamental national rights and the recovery of occupied Arab territories. In order to reach an early  comprehensive and just solution to the regional situation  an international conference on the Middle East will have to be convened without delay with the participation on an equal footing of all parties concerned  including the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).The Iran-Iraq war  which has raged for several years now  has caused both countries heavy losses. We reiterate our wish to see that war between two member States of the Non-Aligned Movement brought to an early end through peaceful negotiations  and we endorse international efforts aimed at helping those two countries achieve a fair political solution based on respect for the legitimate interests of each country and conducive to peace and stability in the region and the world. We express our concern that some forces are taking advantage of the situation in the Gulf area to reinforce their military presence there  thus aggravating tension in the region and rendering it explosive. Such actions must be brought to an immediate end.With the failure of the undeclared war against the Afghan people and the tireless efforts of the Afghan Government in carrying out its policy of national reconciliation and in the search for a political solution to the problems around Afghanistan  the situation there is undergoing fully support the efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan towards holding open dialogues throughout the country so as to achieve national reconciliation  as well as the Soviet-Afghan agreement on the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan within the framework of a political solution to the situation around Afghanistan based on the cessation of all interference in the internal affairs of the Afghan people and on respect for the independence and sovereignty of that country. We denounce all hostile action against this evolution.Viet Nam supports the constructive  fair and reasonable initiative of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea aimed at achieving the peaceful and sovereign reunification of Korea  especially those regarding the reduction of existing armed forces and the holding of high-level political and military talks between the North and South of Korea.We hold in high regard the Indo-Sri Lankana agreement and welcome India's contribution to peace and development in its region and throughout the world.From this rostrum we reaffirm once again the Vietnamese people's staunch support for the Puerto Rican people and the peoples of other small territories struggling for independence and freedom  for the people of Western Sahara struggling for their self-determination  and for the people of Cyprus in their struggle to safeguard the independence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of their homeland. We endorse the initiatives aimed at convening an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations with a view to finding a political solution for the question of Cyprus-Our people's deep sympathy and support goes to the people of New Caledonia who  under the leadership of the Front de liberation nationale Kanak socialiste (FLNKS) are struggling for the right to live in independence and freedom. The referendum recently held under conditions known to all is an impediment to the realization of this sacred right.For the past 40 years  while the world was enjoying the longest period of peace in this century  South-East Asia has been the theatre of the largest  longest and fiercest wars; and although these wars have now ended  that region of the world is still deprived of peace and stability. As a result  it is now more than ever an imperative need  and in their essential interest  for the peoples in the region to secure a framework of peaceful coexistence wherein confrontation would no longer prevail  problems would be settled through peaceful negotiations and good-neighbourly relations established without external interference.The search for a political solution to the Kampuchean problem and the shaping of South-East Asia into a zone of peace  stability and co-operation constitute important objectives of Viet Nam's foreign policy. Together with the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic  Viet Nam has set forth numerous well-meant proposals with a view to finding promptly a fair and reasonable political solution to the Kampuchean question on the basis of the independence  sovereignty and national reconciliation of the Kampuchean people  which would ensure that the land of the brilliant Angkor civilization would never again go through the nightmare of the genocidal Pol Pot regime  and which would establish a framework for lasting peace and stability in South-East Asia. Viet Nam has declared that it would withdraw all of its forces from Kampuchea by 1990 as it did twice before  after it had sent voluntary forces to help the Kampuchean people in the common anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist struggle for the independence and freedom of the two countries. We regret to say  however  that we have not yet received a response to our peace effort and our good will.To try to settle the Kampuchean question without linking it to the solution of the larger issue of peace and stability in South-East Asia would amount to resolving only one aspect of the problem: the settlement would lack substance. The history of the struggle of the three Indochina's peoples shows that the peace of these three nations is closely linked to peace and stability in South-East Asia. In the course of the 40 years of war in Indochina  three international conferences have been held to put an end to the war  namely the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina  the 1962 Geneva Conference on Laos and the 1973 Paris Conference on Viet Nam. Following each of these conferences  however  one war would hardly be ended before a new war would begin  for the conferences only settled the war and failed to draw up a framework for peaceful coexistence in South-East Asia. If a durable and lasting peace is to be secured in the region  the settlement of the Kampuchean issue needs therefore to be linked to a solution of the issues of peace and stability in South-East Asia.The wish to impose the position of one side on the other is hardly fair or realistic. Until now two opposite stances and approaches have prevailed with regard to the issues of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia. The other side demands that Viet Nam withdraw its forces from Kampuchea while the Indochina's countries insist on the removal of the genocidal Pol Pot clique. With the steady growth of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  the three Indochina's countries have declared that Vietnamese forces would be totally withdrawn in 1990 if a political solution of the Kampuchean question could not be reached. Each year since 1982  Viet Nam  in consultation with the People's Republic of Kampuchea  has withdrawn part of its voluntary forces  and before the end of this year another important partial withdrawal will be carried out in the presence  for the first time  of foreign observers. The Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea has made public its policy of national reconciliation whereby it is prepared to meet with the other groups of Khmers and their leaders  except the criminal Pol Pot and his close associates  in order to conduct discussions on national reconciliation based on the non-recurrence  ever  of the scourge of genocide and to join hands with the whole people in defending and rebuilding the country in peace and stability. This is a fundamental long-term policy aimed at uniting all Kampucheans in the endeavour to build an independent  peaceful  non-aligned Kampuchea that would entertain friendly relations with neighbouring countries. Meanwhile  the other side insists on demanding that Viet Nam withdraw its forces and accept the eight-point proposal  which is in fact aimed at bringing about the return of the genocidal Pol Pot regime under cover of the ""Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. A fair solution must respect the positions of both sides. Initiatives beneficial to one side but detrimental to the other and supporting one side against the other can only hinder the peaceful settlement of the issues of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia.In such a situation  consistently persevering in the search for a political solution to the question of Kampuchea and for peace and stability in South-East Asia  the three Indochina's countries  together with a few other countries in the region  have tirelessly endeavoured to break the deadlock. Last July  Viet Nam and Indonesia representing respectively the Indochina's and the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  agreed on the holding of a ""cocktail party""  on the understanding that it would be an informal meeting of the two sides of Kampuchea on an equal footing  without pre-conditions and with no political label  and that  at a later stage  Indonesia would invite other concerned countries  including Viet Nam  to participate in it. They also agreed to reconvene the joint working group as soon as possible to discuss the problems of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia.The People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic have expressed their appreciation and endorsement of the above-mentioned agreements between Viet Nam and Indonesia. The three Indochina's countries are of the view that at the above-mentioned ""cocktail party"" the positions of all sides should serve as the basis for discussion. It may be said that the first rays of hope have begun to dawn.The agreements reached between Viet Nam and Indonesia have opened up the possibility of solving the problems of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia on the basis of equality  respect for the interests of all parties concerned  and without pre-conditions. This is an opportunity not to be missed if a fair and reasonable solution of the problems of South-East Asia and Kampuchea is to be found in conformity with the correct resolution on South-East Asia  adopted by the seventh summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in New Delhi and reaffirmed by its eighth summit Conference in Harare  and with the general trend of the world and regional situations. That is precisely why these agreements were widely welcomed by public opinion so quickly. The People's Republic of Kampuchea declared its readiness to enter talks with opposition groups  and Prince Sihanouk's statement on 18 September last concerning a meeting between the opposing sides of Kampuchea is in keeping not on with the People's Republic of Kampuchea's policy of national reconciliation but also with the 29 July 1987 agreement between Viet Nam and Indonesia.Viet Nam and the other Indochina's States regard the agreements between Viet Nam and Indonesia as agreements reached between the Indochina's countries and the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the search for a political solution to the question of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia. Therefore  there should not be differing interpretations for the sake of anyone's expediency; rather  both sides concerned are duty bound to respect and implement these agreements. Otherwise it will be impossible to give credibility to any future agreement. It is regrettable that at present some force: inside and outside the region should be trying to play down the significance of these agreements  impede their implementation and prevent dialogue towards a political settlement  thus going against the legitimate aspirations of the Kampuchean people and other peoples in the region.We should like to take this opportunity sincerely to thank those countries  organizations and individuals that have contributed to the shaping of a new conjuncture in South-East Asia propitious for dialogue in the region  and we call on them to continue doing their utmost for the promotion of substantive dialogue towards a political solution to the problem of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia.We highly appreciate the considerable efforts exerted by the Secretary-General  in his personal capacity  to encourage dialogue between the two groups of countries in the region  and we hope that he will persevere in his efforts in that direction.In connection with the search for a political solution to the problems of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia  eventual relations of friendship and co-operation between the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of China would play a very important role. The Vietnamese people treasure their traditional friendship with the Chinese people. The two peoples used to unite and support each other in their respective revolutionary endeavours for national independence and socialism. The aspirations of both peoples as well as the long-term interests of both countries are not mutually exclusive. Moved by the desire to restore normal relations with China  Viet Nam has repeatedly stated its readiness to negotiate with China wherever  whenever and at whatever level it may choose so as to settle substantive matters in their mutual relations as well as questions of mutual concern  for the sake of peace  friendship and co-operation between the two peoples and among the peoples of South-East Asia and of Asia and the Pacific.The United States has an important role to play in ensuring peace and stability in South-East Asia. The Vietnamese people are prepared to turn to a new chapter of history and to facilitate the development of relations of friendship and co-operation between the two peoples. The recent visit to Viet Nam of General John Vessey  special envoy of President Reagan  together with the understanding reached  has created an atmosphere conducive to the solution of humanitarian concerns of both the Vietnamese and the United States sides.History confronts the men of today with a heavy responsibility that cannot be shirked - namely  how to create firm premises for development in peace  friendship and co-operation among all nations in the remaining years of this century and the early years of the twenty-first century. To discharge that lofty mission there is no alternative to dialogue and co-operation in good faith. Let us hope such a spirit will prevail not only in the settlement of international and regional issues  including those of South-East Asia  but also in the work of this forty-second session of the General Assembly."
"146",7428,"VUT",42,1987,"﻿Sir  I have the honour of extending to you the congratulations and best wishes of the Government and people of Vanuatu on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this forty-second session. Your unanimous election is both a personal tribute and a token of esteem for the country you represent. I take pleasure also in thanking your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  for the manner in which he guided us during the forty-first session of the General Assembly. In addition we join in thanking the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts. His work and that of his staff and the entire Secretariat are sources of pride to us all. In this regard we commend the addition to his team of Ambassador Joseph V. Reed as Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs. He has a rather large pair of shoes to fill  but all who know him have no doubt that he is equal to the task.Taking the floor immediately after Dr. Kenneth Kaunda  President of Zambia and current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity  is a great honour and at the same time a great responsibility. It is not easy to follow to the rostrum of this body one so eloquent and so universally admired as is President Kaunda. He looms large in history as a spokesman for those who cherish mankind's highest ideals. Today he has spoken not only for the people of Zambia and the continent of Africa but also for all who believe in the United Nations.	It is always a great honour and rare privilege to speak before the United Nations General Assembly. Today the honour is greater and the privilege later because of the presence of President Kaunda and his penetrating words. We  like others  applaud his wisdom  his dedication and his sensitivity. We also concur with his vision of a world in which humanity is permitted to blossom to its fullest potential.The ability to communicate through the medium of the spoken or written word  so movingly demonstrated by President Kaunda today  is one of mankind's greatest achievements. Occasionally that ability is taken for granted and neither appreciated nor properly utilized.Those few who - because of their economic or military strength - hold in their hands the power of life or death over so many other human beings  often do not feel the need to listen to those of us who do not command vast fortunes powerful armies or large armadas. When they do listen they tend to listen mechanically  with their ears rather than with their hearts. They then frequently fail to heed the poignant messages addressed to them.Thus  year after year  speaker after speaker walks to this rostrum  stands before the nations of the world and states the case for independence for Namibia  an end to apartheid in South Africa and common decency and justice foe the Palestinians. Speaker after speaker pleads for justice and peace for the people of Central America and South-East Asia. Speaker after speaker calls for an end to the arms race and the recurring nuclear nightmares of small children everywhere. Were these words to be listened to  and heeded  they would be almost magical in what they could achieve.Words are like magic. They can transport one to another time  another place  or another dimension. They can express the full range of human experiences and emotions  from charity to greed  from forgiveness to indignation  from humility to arrogance  from hope to despair  from love to hatred. Words can be instruments of enlightenment or revelations of ignorance. Words can stir  inspire and move listeners to action or lull them into indifference  boredom and inactivity.Words are capable of opening minas or closing them. They are capable of expanding horizons or restricting them. They can bring us together or drive us further apart. Words are potentially more powerful than any military weapon known to mankind. They have been known to make tyrants tremble and dictatorships decay.That is why some fear the written or spoken word as much as they fear anything. That is why eighteenth and nineteenth century slave holders in the western hemisphere made it ""illegal"" for the human beings they held in bondage to learn to read and write and forbade them to communicate in their own languages. That is why well past the mid-point of the twentieth century  in even the most developed of countries  some parents have had to struggle to see their children get any semblance of a decent education. That is why the apartheid regime of South Africa has spared no effort to stifle the voices or that country's bravest sons and daughters.That is why in so many lands  large and small  developed and Developing  north and south  east and west  so many generations of courageous human beings have pleaded  petitioned  marched and agitated for the right to be educated and the right to be heard. That is why today we search for words which will  as a renowned Mozambican poet wrote  “'... enter every house like the wind and fail like red hot embers on our people's soulsWith all that words can do  none can do more than words of candour and sincerity. The late Amilcar Cabrai once encouraged his colleagues  in the African Party for the Independence of Guinea (Bissau) and Cape Verde  to hide nothing from the masses of the people and to tell no lies  claim no easy victories. That admonition is as appropriate to us here  at the United Nations today  as it was 22 years ago to those struggling to bring freedom to two small West African countries.Truth is a mighty weapon. It is in fact the greatest weapon possessed by those who would feed the hungry  house the homeless  heal the sick  educate the illiterate  end senseless violence and generally help create a more equitable world.In none of those areas will the international community be able to claim an easy victory; not one of these things will be easy to achieve. Then  again  that which is worth working for  that which is worth struggling for  seldom is easy. We would be guilty of the worst form of naivety were we to suggest otherwise.    Words alone  no matter how beautiful  are not sufficient to resolve the hard issues on the agenda of the United Nations. If they were  Namibia would be a mil Member of the United Nations  Palestine would be a Member of the United Nations and South Africa would be represented by a legitimate Government and would be seated in this Hall today.If words alone were sufficient/ the questions of Cyprus  Kampuchea and Afghanistan would no longer appear on our agenda. If words alone were sufficient  the peoples of Western Sahara  East Timor and New Caledonia would already have been permitted to assume their rightful places within the community of nations.Words  however  no matter how articulate  how truthful  how forceful  now insightful or how well-intended  are never enough. They probably will never be enough. Frederick Douglas  a leader of the anti-slavery movement during the nineteenth century and a great orator  expressed that best when he said:""Power concedes nothing without а demand. It never did and it never will.Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them  and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows  or with both.""Every year the General Assembly passes a stream of resolutions. The words of those resolutions  taken together  comprise some of the most noble thoughts and theories known to mankind. What is far less noble is the lack of resolve by some Members of the United Nations when we leave this hall and it is time to implement our collective decisions.It is not enough merely to denounce apartheid. It will not disappear without a struggle. How long and how violent a struggle is up to those who imposed apartheid on South Africa's people and then on Namibia. We  the rest of the world  must in a real sense support those who struggle against apartheid and adopt for ourselves values which differ from the values of those who practise this onerous creed  as well as the values of those who profit from it. The values we embrace should be the values of those who respect the genuine universality of every human being. Those values must be embraced at all times  in all places  and not merely when and where the world happens to be looking or listening.Silence  or inaction  in the face of a known evil in one corner of the globe can be taken as acceptance of other evils in other corners of the globe. We  the international community  must be consistent and unremitting foes - no matter the price - of anyone who would assign a second- or third-class status to any person because of his or her race  religion  sex  language or economic status. The essential need to secure and hold the higher ground during any engagement of hostile forces is a well-known axiom of military science. In mankind's moral engagement to determine the future destiny of our planet  we should apply the same axiom and secure and maintain the higher ground.No person held in slavery should aspire to be a slave-holder. No person who has known the bitter taste of discrimination should himself  or herself  discriminate against another. No person who has been victimized should look for others to become his  or her  victim.It pains us deeply to see some former colonies fail to understand the legitimate strivings of others for their own independence. Interruptions in the process of decolonization are even more tragic when the intruding State is itself a former colony which might have helped a neighbour's first tentative steps on the path to reclaiming its own identity. Vanuatu's position on this question is based on what it perceives as what is right and what is wrong  rather than on what others might perceive as either convenient  expedient  safe or a fait accompli.Thus  it is Vanuatu's hope that the people of Western Sahara  the people of East Timor and others similarly situated will be allowed to realize their dreams also. Their rights are as sacred as those of anyone else represented here today. If there is no room at the inn for them  then very few of us should feel secure about our own places.We are similarly saddened by the tragic spectacle of intercommunal strife which plagues every corner of the earth. There is no need to recite the names  the dates or the places. Everyone is already painfully familiar with them. Much of this intercommunal strife has its roots in a shared colonial history. Some pre-dates colonialism and is the result of antagonisms that go back many centuries. Understanding the roots of a problem should help us to combat it. Unfortunately  demagogues are always willing to exploit and manipulate existing social contradictions for their own selfish ends and carry others down a destructive path. We  the international community  must maintain the higher moral ground. We should address these social contradictions and try to resolve them. How we go about it is the important question. We should let our actions signal to others the type of world we would like to see.The dignity and majesty of the victims of the apartheid regime of South Africa are  we believe  an example for the rest of the world. The African National Council (ANC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) have consistently maintained the higher ground by steadfastly refusing to adopt the values of the Pretoria regime. We have great faith in their vision of the future. They struggle for their people and against a system  rather than against fellow human beings. To secure the future of this planet  it rests with all of us to learn from them and stop waging war against each other and against each other's children. It rests with us not to adopt the discredited values of immoral regimes. It rests with us not to act as proxies for others who are only too willing to divide us by seductively whispering in an ear how bad one ethnic group or another is.The tragic war between Iran and Iraq is an example of a conflict which involves a complex web of historical contradictions. Like most other countries  Vanuatu was appalled by the outbreak of this war and is appalled by its continuation  Vanuatu has never taken sides on the antagonisms that exist between these two States and will not do so now} we consider both friends. However  one must ask this; does there come a point beyond which one wages war against a neighbour and begins to wage war against one's own professed values  and one's own people  and the rest of civilization? We do not have-answers to the questions passed by this tragedy. Like so many others  we merely address an appeal to the decency and common sense of both parties to the conflict. We ask them please to try to reason together and arrive at some mutually agreeable formula. Let there be neither victors nor vanquished; let there simply be peace.The war between Iran and Iraq  the loss of life it entails and its economic consequences bring to mind the relevancy of the recently concluded International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. Although the result of the Conference was not completely satisfactory  the consensus that was arrived at was an important step on the path we must all walk together. None of us can walk that or any other road alone. The economic situation faced by developing countries has been discussed at length  we will not at this time expand further on what has already been so adequately said by others similarly situated. However   we cannot help but observe that when developing countries wish to build a railroad  a port facility  an airport  a communications network  schools  health clinics or other parts of a national infrastructure all sorts of financial obstacles are encountered. But  when a developing country wishes to buy weapons  credit can always be arranged. This is true no matter how poor or how small the country  regardless of its other needs  and no matter how ill prepared its military might be to absorb certain equipment. Some seem to confuse the business of selling weapons with the art of diplomacy. For them  the way to win friends and influence people is to market the means of mass destruction. In most instances  the friends that are gained are many times fewer than those that are lost. The recent agreement in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union to dismantle intermediate-range nuclear forces is a positive  although tentative  step. There are  of course  a great many more complex issues to be addressed. Therefore  the proposed upcoming meeting between the leaders of those two countries is another welcome sign. President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev will carry with them the prayers and hopes of the entire world when they meet. The prospect of a productive dialogue between them is a harbinger of a better international climate.The world cannot help but be encouraged by the example of these two great nations learning to live with each other. Certainly Iran and Iraq should be able to find as much common ground as have the United States and the Soviet Union. After years of harsh and bitter fighting  it appears that common ground may now exist in another part of the world. The recently concluded agreement between five Central American Presidents is a positive step worthy of international support. Peace  and the opportunity to pursue justice without fear  may finally be at hand for the people of that troubled region.In this connection  Vanuatu also joins in supporting appeals for the normalization of relations between Belize and Guatemala. Recognition of the national identity  dignity and territorial integrity of all six nations of Central America is an essential element in the promotion of peaceful coexistence and economic development for the people of that region.Few areas of the world cry out as much for adherence to the basic values of human decency as does the Middle East  When all is said and done  the fact remains that in that part of the world the fundamental contradiction  the fundamental problem  the fundamental wrong  is the systematic effort to deny the humanity of the Palestinian people. Their homes  their hopes and their futures were sacrificed to establish the State of Israel. Now  neighbouring Lebanon faces a doubtful future. Its children's dreams have also been sacrificed. Is there no limit to what the world expects the people of that region to endure? This is a matter that has vexed and plagued the international community for longer than anyone cares to remember. Over the years  there have been a great many heroes and civilians on both sides. Certainly  neither side is pure but  here again  each must reach out to the other. It makes as much sense today to ignore the Palestine Liberation Organization as it did earlier to attempt to deny the existence of the people it represents. This is a problem that the international community helped to create. Thus  it is a matter that we must help to resolve. We can begin by convening the much discussed international conference on the Middle East.William Shakespeare once aptly stated that the past is the prologue. We believe that solutions to many of the items on the agenda of the United Nations require that we look to the future rather than be prisoners of the past. Today the United Nations affords mankind an opportunity to avoid many of yesterday's mistakes.However  like Shakespeare  we believe that truly to comprehend the nature of some of the current problems and the motivation of some of the principal actors on the world stage  we must also have knowledge of the past. In this regard we note regrettably that some  notably the apartheid regime of South Africa  live so far in the past that they are incapable of comprehending the lessons of history.South Africa's slave-State conditions are not historically unique. In recent years those conditions have been modified in form but not in substance. Thus  South Africa remains fundamentally as uncompromisingly racist as other parts of the world were in the nineteenth century.The changes that have occurred resulted in part from the impact of the rapidly changing world of the twentieth century. However  the most important catalyst has been  and continues to be  the efforts of the people of South Africa who have simply refused to be docile.Apartheid ranks with slavery  the inhuman excesses of the colonial era  the holocaust of the Second World War era and other acts of genocide  among the most significant crimes ever committed against humanity. Apartheid is not always discussed in the same context as slavery. However  for many reasons we believe it should be. The commercial traffic in human beings known as the trans-Atlantic slave trade  like its lesser known counterpart in the South Pacific  earned universal condemnation for its evil nature and the horror it created. That sinful behaviour cost millions of lives and destroyed entire societies. It wrenched families apart and eventually became the genesis of colonialism. The depth and magnitude of the human suffering caused by the slave trade is incalculable. Similarly  the financial wealth accumulated by an assortment of kidnappers  hijackers  thugs and terrorists - yes  terrorists - as a result of the traffic in human beings can never be calculated. Some may have forgotten. Others  no doubt  would prefer to forget this important page of history.We make this reference today not out of bitterness. There is no rancour in our hearts and no recrimination is intended. We merely wish every nation represented here today to remember and comprehend the past so that we will understand the true context of South Africa  the nature of Humanity's foe in Pretoria and what the international community must do to overcome that for. South Africa has not yet learned the lessons of history. Therefore the rest of the world must strive harder to bring the message of those lessons home to South Africa. We must become better interpreters and instructors of history than we have been to date.Despite circumstances and conditions which would test the patience of a saint. Nelson Mandela has maintained the moral higher ground we spoke of earlier. He and his colleagues have taught their gaolers a most important lesson. Indeed  in a sense  he and many of his people are freer than those who placed him in prison and who fearfully stand guard over an entire aroused nation. It is our hope that by the end of this session of the general Assembly all of us will be standing with Mr. Mandela and no one will either apologize for  or protect  his gaolers. Those who traffic in narcotic drugs have much in common with those who now govern South Africa. Both value material wealth over human life and moral decency. Both sell the false dream of a mindless form of existence. Both offer nothing more than modern-day slavery in different forms. Both deserve nothing but the sternest concerted international action to eradicate them from the human experience.The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held in Vienna this past June under the able presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia  Mr. Mahathir bin Mohamad  was an important milestone. Vanuatu is pleased to note the Increasing International realization that not a single region  not a single nation  not a single community  not a single individual is untouched  or immune  from the scourge of drug abuse or the curse of drug traffickers and what they bring with them. However  no nation  not even the richest and most powerful among us  can feel that it is doing enough to address this major challenge to civilization. The evidence of this fact surrounds us  unfortunately  and threatens to drown us all.Terrorism also threatens to drown civilization. This is as true of the type of terrorism practised by those who appear at a door in the middle of the night wearing official uniforms  armed with the blessings of a State apparatus and who have perfected techniques of torture  as it is of those individuals who take it upon themselves to kidnap and cruelly traffic in human beings much as slave traders and pirates did in an earlier era. It is also as true of the type of terrorism that holds all of humanity captive to the very real danger posed by nuclear arsenals  as it is of those who commit random acts of violence using more conventional Instruments of death. Terrorism is wrong. It is wrong morally. It is wrong tactically. It is wrong politically. There are not exceptions and no qualifying conditions. One cannot use criminal tactics without becoming a criminal. The values of an organization or a movement are  like the values of an individual  determined by how that organization or movement lives and how it values life - all life. That is true whether the life being valued is that of one who is black  white  brown or yellow; whether it is the life of one who is Muslim  Christian  Jewish  Buddhist  atheist or agnostic; whether it is the life of one who is gifted or disabled; or whether it is the life of one who is wealthy or one who lives in poverty.We now turn to a subject we wish we did not have to turn to. In the forty-second year of the existence of the United Nations  27 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  this body should not still have before it the question of Namibia or the question of New Caledonia.Despite the obvious obstacles to its independence  there is no longer any question as to whether Namibia's people have the right to their own identity and their own country. Even if South Africa were tomorrow somehow to transfer large numbers of whites into Namibia - many of them military personnel and civil servants - and enough people from neighbouring countries to make the Namibians a minority in their own country  no one would be deceived and question Namibia's right to become an independent nation. South Africa  by its intransigence  has managed to delay the inevitable  but it cannot at this stage rewrite history.In New Caledonia  the administering Power is attempting to defraud the colonized people and deceive the international community through a policy of demographic engineering. Through its deliberate actions in encouraging migration to New Caledonia  it has now succeeded in turning that Territory's people into a minority - although still the largest community numerically - in their own land. The question before us now is  should such actions by a colonial Power be allowed to frustrate the legitimate aspirations of a colonized people and a decision of the United Nations? Common sense and morality  as well as the Charter and many pronouncements of the United Nations  clearly indicate that the answer isThe Government of Vanuatu wishes to make it clear once again that it has no quarrel with the Government or people of Prance. It wishes Prance  and the people of that great nation  nothing but continued prosperity and success. These wishes are sincere and earnest. They are not  however  given at the expense of the people of New Caledonia or those of any other territory whose lands and resources may be coveted by a segment of the French population.Vanuatu is New Caledonia's closest neighbour. It is also a country that has a shared colonial history with that of New Caledonia and an affinity for its people that can perhaps only be understood by other peoples who also have so much in common  Last year we  and other countries of the South Pacific were gratified by the support we received on the question of New Caledonia at the Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held at Harare  Zimbabwe. We are further pleased that today  New Caledonia's colonized people continue to enjoy the support of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in their campaign to regain that which they never surrendered.We were also gratified by the decision taken by the General Assembly last December to place New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Delegations may recall the atmosphere in the General Assembly in the days leading up to that decision and on the particular day the vote was taken. Delegations may also recall the things that were said and the way in which they were said.Some were told that New Caledonia was a part of Prance and that this matter had no business being discussed at the United Nations. Some were told that what became resolution 41/41 A was unnecessary because the Committee of 24 was going to consider the question anyway. Some were told that the countries of the South Pacific harboured irrational ill feelings towards France and did not know what they were doing. That last statement was the most incredulous of the many incredulous things that were said.Looking back one must wonder  if Prance was so convinced that New Caledonia was a part of France  why it conducted what it termed a referendum on the Territory's future only a few weeks ago. We will not even pose the question how and when New Caledonia became a ""part"" of France. We will save that question for another day.One must also wonder why if resolution 41/41 A was so unnecessary  France still has not transmitted the information required of it under Article 73e of the Charter. On the basis of the arguments it put forward last year# one might have surmised that France intended to co-operate with the Committee of 24. Instead  the only information that has been forthcoming is the rather inaccurate statement made by the Foreign Minister of France in his address to the Assembly on 23 September 1987. With all due respect to the Foreign Minister  we do not consider a plebiscite organized without due regard for the accepted principles and practices of the United Nations to be a valid act of self-determination. This is particularly true when the colonized people boycott the entire process.The result was predictable  and was predicted. Those who are French chose to remain French. We would have expected nothing else. For the most part  those who are not French did not vote.Is France now proposing that similar votes be organized in other areas under occupation? Could such a plebiscite turn the Golan Heights  for example  into part of Israel? By extension of this logic  might we permit South Africa to further its claim to an important part of Namibia through a little demographic engineering? In a somewhat similar vein  are we now prepared to accept France's claim to Mayotte? In the future  will we accept any large country's claim to a smaller  less populous land  simply because its people are overwhelmed numerically and  most important  militarily?	.This is the way the world operated in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries  and in the early part of this century before there was a United Nations Is this what we wish to return to? What France is now telling the world flies in the face of logic and United Nations precedent. It is also a radical departure from the currently accepted norm of international behaviour  and a very dangerous departure from the accepted practice of decolonization. Furthermore  we do not agree with the Foreign Minister's statement that conditions in New Caledonia during the plebiscite  ""... were calm and beyond dispute"" (A/42/PV.8  ρ 36). Through the eyes of television cameras  the world saw how ""calm"" things were in New Caledonia in the weeks leading up to the vote. We are as pleased as anyone that there was not more violence. However  we attribute this to the patience of the Kanak people and the intimidating presence of French military forces  which controlled the colonized population very effectively. The French military did its job very well.Now we  the international community  have our own mission to perform. We must continue to follow the principles and practices we established. We must continue to be faithful to our Charter and to our own histories.The Committee of 24 has recommended a draft resolution which does exactly that. It is balanced and moderate in tone. We hope members will lend their support to this draft and thereby remain faithful to the United Nations' own stated values. We merely ask that the United Nations be allowed to play its customary role. What could be more reasonable?Prance is an important member of this body. It occupies a permanent seat on the Security Council and in other ways exercises considerable influence within and without the Organization  It should  therefore  be among the first to respect the letter and the spirit of the decisions of the world body. Being fair to those who have been colonized in New Caledonia can only enhance  rather than diminish  the prestige and glory of France.We will continue to make this appeal until it is heard by France with its heart  as well as with its ears. If it is ignored  we will continue until it is heeded. Nothing will dissuade Vanuatu from this cause  other than the Kanak people themselves saying that this is no longer their cause. Vanuatu has no ulterior motive in pressing this case. We have nothing to hide  and nothing to gain  save security in the knowledge that the United Nations is still the Organization that the words of its Charter recite."
"147",7462,"WSM",42,1987,"﻿I should like to congratulate you most sincerely. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will guide our deliberations with care and competence.1 should also like to congratulate Ambassador Joseph Reed on his assumption of the post of Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs and to welcome him warmly.Our grateful thanks go to Mr. Humayun Choudhury of Bangladesh for the wisdom and skill with which he conducted our proceedings at the last session of the General Assembly.We are delighted that the Secretary-General remains in good health  and we express our gratitude and respect to him for his tireless and patient efforts to resolve difficult international problems. This past year has been a year of rejoicing and celebration for our nation  which commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its independence. It was a year of pride and an occasion for reflection and reaffirmation; an opportunity for re-examination of our national values and ideals and reassessment of our aims and aspirations  it was  in fact  a chance to look forward to our future in the light of lessons learned over the past 25 years.We see great merit in this process of slowing down and taking stock of our successes and failures at appropriate times  and that is  of course  what the United Nations did when it celebrated its fortieth anniversary two years ago  which provided an occasion for us all to reflect on its history and Its future. Ringing reaffirmations of faith in its ideals were given that year  and a searching re-examination of how best to achieve those ideals was begun. It has resulted in a realistic assessment that has set in train a process of reform that we are certain will have far-teaching beneficial effects not only on the actual performance of the United Nations and its Members but also on how the United Nations is perceived by the world community. The Secretary-General has noted in his annual report that the adoption last year of resolution 41/213 on the review of the efficiency of the administration and financial functioning of the United Nations was a step that could signify a major turning-point for the United Nations. We agree and  while acknowledging the problems and dangers that remain  we are much encouraged. This then we feel is a year for optimism not only as far as practical matters and reforms are concerned but as far as political will and co-operation within the United Nations process are concerned as well. It seems to us that a generally more co-operative and conciliatory mood is permeating the United Nations  and we hope that this is not only an acknowledgement of renewed faith in the United Nations and its goals but also a revival of the spirit of multilateralism and a recognition of our global mutual interdependence.We see in various situations  which at times may have seemed hopeless  evidence that solutions are possible and in some cases may not be far off.The Iran-Iraq war - that disastrous conflict between brothers - rages on  but we have seen determination and unanimity in the Security Council in its pursuit of a cease-fire and brave persistence on the part of the Secretary-General in trying to bring an end to this tragedy. These efforts must continue  and whatever measures are deemed necessary must be taken to achieve a cease-fire and to stop the fuelling of the fires of this war by the sale of arms to both sides.In Afghanistan  while foreign troops still occupy the land  the negotiations to bring about their withdrawal are at an advanced stage  and we are encouraged to hope that a solution will soon emerge ensuring early withdrawal and enabling the refugees to return home and all Afghans to choose freely their government and to participate in the rehabilitation of their war-torn land.In Kampuchea  while foreign forces also remain and the conflict persists  the Secretary-General states in his report that he has recently detected some signs of movement that he hopes will develop in the right direction  and we are encouraged by this. We note that the Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in their meeting in Bangkok on 16 August 1987 have called for a cocktail party"" in which the Cambodian factions and Viet Nam can start a dialogue. We applaud ASEAN’s efforts to find a solution to the Kampuchean problem and to promote peace in South-East Asia. We encourage acceptance of the eight-point proposal of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  which calls for national reconciliation leading to a quadripartite government in which all parties would participate and which would be headed by His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk  who is widely respected.In Central America  until recently a solution seemed far off; but we see now  with President Arias' ten-point peace plan  the prospect of peace and settlement of problems becoming a more possible reality and we are heartened by the conclusion of the Guatemala accord among the Central American States  an agreement to establish peace in accordance with the principles of sovereignty  common security  non-interference  democracy and development. We must now hope that all parties involved maintain the momentum of the peace process.	On the Korean peninsula  the reduction of tension between the two parts of Korea is the most essential step towards resolving the Korean question and ultimate peaceful unification through dialogue and negotiation. We hope that dialogue will soon be resumed in the interest of peace and security in the region. As a step towards reconciliation and reunification  we support the admission of both the North and South to the United Nations. The principle of universality leads us to support accession for all those countries that wish it and are prepared to abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter. We consider that the Republic of Korea is already an active member of the international community and that it fulfils those requirements. The Republic of Korea's capital city  Seoul  is to host the 1988 Olympic Games. We hope that the spirit of sportsmanship engendered by participation in next year's Olympics in Seoul will help not only to bring all countries of the world together in harmony but  in particular  to create an atmosphere which will be conducive to the improvement of relations between North and South Korea. We extend good wishes for the success of the Olympics.Though the problems in Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli conflict may seem Intractable  there are glimmers of hope. Faint hopes for a peaceful settlement in Lebanon flicker from time to time but  unfortunately  fade before they come to fruition. Outside Interference in Lebanon must cease  foreign forces must withdraw and Lebanon's sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence must be respected. The United Nations Interim Force must also be respected to enable it to fulfil its mandate and carry out its important peace-keeping mission without harassment. We must give it our full support. In the Middle East there has been some progress with regard to the idea of convening an international conference under United Nations auspices  and we feel that with the participation and approval of all parties this would be a most positive development. Any solution to the problem must guarantee both the right of Israel to a secure existence within internationally recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  indeed  to live in their own territory with the authorities and form of government they choose.There is one area of the world where there seems little hope at the moment - South Africa. The South African Government's continuance of the abhorrent system apartheid is completely unconscionable  as is the unjustified delay in the transition to independence of Namibia  which South Africa still illegally occupies and exploits. South Africa's extension of the state of emergency and continuous cruel repression and violations of human rights involving even very young children have made it a pariah among nations  as have its attacks on the front-line States. These States need and should be given international assistance and support. The pressure on South Africa must be sustained  and we support the efforts of the United Nations and the Commonwealth in this regard.One of the most promising rays of hope on the international scene is the proposed summit meeting between the leaders of the United States of America and the Soviet Union  and the agreement between them to work towards the dismantling of intermediate- and short-range missiles. This is the first time in history that there has been a proposal for an agreement that will actually eliminate nuclear weapons  and we see it as a most positive and significant initial step towards the preservation of our planet. We applaud it.Another important step in this direction has been the report of the Brundtland Commission  entitled ""Our Common Future""  which in its strong and very forthright exposition stresses the urgency of protecting our resources and our environment. Our survival  and that of the Earth's environment  depend on our paying heed to the urgent ecological concerns that scientists throughout the world are bringing to our attention. The Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme has acted most appropriately in submitting to the General Assembly this report and another major report of great significance  ""The environmental perspective to the year 2000 and beyond"". Countries of the world can no longer ignore the proliferating and worsening threats to our environment  such as the thinning of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect  desertification  deforestation and the ever increasing pollution and poisoning of the earth  sea and sky by waste and chemicals. Acting under the provisions of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer of 1985  Member States have taken a small step by agreeing gradually to phase out chlorofluorocarbons but there is much more to do and it must be done urgently. Our very real concern about the environment is reflected in the recently concluded Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region.In addition to the work on the environmental front  essential work is going on under United Nations auspices in several other fields that urgently affect our chances of survival  and bring us some hope that we might eventually overcome the crisis the world now faces.The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  which was held in Vienna in June  under the most able presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia  Mr. Mahathir Mohamed  was an important step forward in attempts to curb this scourge and also a significant example of successful international co-operation. The 35-point programme drawn up by the Conference is a comprehensive battle plan in the war against drugs. The World Health Organization (WHO) is continuing its efforts to combat disease and poor health conditions throughout the world. The global tragedy of AIDS (acquired immune-deficiency syndrome) and the commendable response to it made by WHO through its special programme on AIDS has highlighted the importance of international health co-operation under United Nations auspices. WHO will take an essential leadership and co-ordinating role in AIDS prevention  control  research  education and public awareness  and in an information campaign.Although predictions had been gloomy  the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) proved to be a most significant and important meeting. There was a revival of international economic dialogue and a realistic reappraisal of world economic problems. The Final Act  adopted by consensus  demonstrated that the developed and developing countries can listen to one another and work towards constructive multilateral interaction. We are encouraged by the resolve of the stronger economies to take concrete steps to revitalize development  growth and international trade. In this connection  Japan's decision to channel some of its external surplus to developing countries is most welcome. The serious plight of the least developed countries and the breakdown of the development process in them was acknowledged. The Final Act stated :""There was a consensus on the need for full and expeditious implementation of the SNPA and of the recommendations of the Mid-Term Review as adopted."" (Final Act of UNCTAD VII  para; 110)Samoa gives its full support to this thrust and trusts that the positive mood engendered by the Conference will continue. The important work being carried out by the United Nations Development Programme in promoting development deserves increasing support. The Programme's input into the development activities of underdeveloped countries is a valuable component of the overall assistance they are given. The United Nations Development Programme must be encouraged to play to the fullest extent the role that it is uniquely placed to play most effectively and efficiently in the delivery of overall development assistance.Also of importance during the UNCTAD VII Conference was the signature or ratification of the common fund for commodities Agreement by many more countries. These were significant steps towards bringing the fund into operation  and the decision by the Soviet Union to sign it was of particular significance.South-South co-operation is also most important to the world's future  and the convening of the South Commission  which has begun its work  is a promising sign in this area. It is encouraging that many developing countries support the establishment of this Independent Commission of the South on Development Issues  as it is officially titled  and we feel it could not be under more able chairmanship than that of Mr. Julius Nyerere. We hope all countries of the South will support its work.The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  held recently at United Nations Headquarters  focused attention on the priorities of today that have allowed expenditures on armaments to get completely out of proportion to expenditures on development. Given economic and social underdevelopment  and the misery and poverty afflicting more than two thirds of mankind - to say nothing of the homeless  who are the focus of special United Nations attention this year - the extent of spending on military budgets throughout the world is almost beyond belief. However  some promising developments  such as China's programme to reduce its army by a million soldiers  give us reason to hope that change may come and that it may eventually be possible for the world to focus its attention where it should: on the health and welfare of the peoples o£ the world.Several other areas of disarmament show promise. The success of the Conference on Confidence Building Measures in Stockholm in 1986 was gratifying  as is the progress towards a chemical weapons convention. While we are encouraged by these developments we are alarmed by the continuation of nuclear testing and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We view the completion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty as of the utmost urgency  and we place great importance on universal acceptance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.I shall conclude by turning to our own region of the world  and speak in my capacity as current Chairman of the South Pacific Forum.I wish to raise a matter which the United Nations members of the Forum have brought before this Assembly and which is of deep concern to us all in the region. It is the situation in New Caledonia.The South Pacific Forum is  as the General Assembly may know  the regional organization of the independent and self-governing peoples of the South Pacific. The Heads of Government of the South Pacific Forum countries meet annually to deal with matters of concern to the region. It was at those meetings that careful consideration of the increasing severity of the problems in New Caledonia led the Heads of Government to their conclusion that United Nations involvement was essential. We therefore sought the re-inscription of New Caledonia on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. It was also the wish of the Forum to pursue dialogue with France in an attempt to have it resume dialogue with all parties in New Caledonia. Thus the Forum countries requested the re-inscription of New Caledonia in the firm belief that it would assist the progress of New Caledonia towards the exercise of a legitimate act of self-determination in co-operation with the United Nations. We recognized that the principles of decolonization/ including the inalienable right to self-determination established in the Charter and the Declaration on decolonization  applied to New Caledonia. We recognized also that New Caledonia is a Non-Self-Governing Territory in the terms of the Charter and the Declaration on decolonization. Gratefully aware of the constructive role the United Nations had played in the decolonization of the Pacific/ the members of the Forum felt that the United Nations should be involved in the continuation of that process/ as was right and proper.Those were our reasons for seeking re-inscription/ and we were gratified to know that the world community/ with valuable support from the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  had taken the same view when resolution 41/41 A received such strong support at the last session of the General Assembly. We are most grateful for that support  which paved the way for the United Nations to play a constructive and proper role in bringing New Caledonia to a genuine act of self-determination in accordance with United Nations practices and principles. We are also pleased at the heightened international interest that this has brought about  which focuses special attention on the plight of New Caledonia's indigenous people.Since re-inscription  the Special Committee on Decolonization has twice considered New Caledonia. In March  the Committee adopted a decision calling on France to co-operate with the Committee and to transmit information under Article 73 (e) of the Charter. It urged France to prepare the Territory for a free and genuine act of self-determination. Regrettably  French co-operation has not been forthcoming. In August  the Committee adopted a resolution on New Caledonia after a substantive debate. The resolution  inter alia  regretted that Prance had not responded to the call to submit information.It declares that progress towards a long-term political solution in New Caledonia requires a free and genuine act of self-determination consistent with United Nations principles and practices. The resolution emphasizes that such an act of self-determination  in which all options should be made available  should be preceded by a comprehensive programme of prior political education in which all options are impartially presented and the consequences fully explained. Thus the Committee made clear to France what was required of it by the international community.The Committee also provided a valuable forum for petitioners to be heard on the subject  especially the representatives of the indigenous people of New Caledonia. Their representatives will be here again when the question is further considered by the General Assembly.It is clear from what I have said that the French attitude to the United Nations on New Caledonia has been one of consistent non-co-operation. There has been no response to communications from the United Nations on New Caledonia and no information has been transmitted as required under Article 13 e of the Charter.France has  in fact  not deviated from its unilateral path. It went ahead with its planned exercise - a so-called referendum on the future of New Caledonia - on 13 September. The General Assembly heard the French interpretation of the referendum as provided by the Foreign Minister of France in his statement on 23 September. We in the Forum cannot accept that interpretation. As I have indicated elsewhere  to pretend that the so-called referendum has legitimately determined the political future of New Caledonia is untenable. Given the circumstances  what other result could there have been? Indeed  it was the culmination of sustained efforts by the Government of France over the last several months to produce an outcome favouring continued French rule. In conducting the poll  France paid little or no regard to the established practices and principles of decolonization enshrined in the Charter. The referendum was a unilateral act devoid of any significance in this body.Why do we consider it unacceptable? The basic fact is that it did not conform to the principles of decolonization. It was not conducted in co-operation with the United Nations; the options offered to the electorate were restricted; there was no political education regarding the options; punitive consequences were implicitly and  on occasion  explicitly  attached to the independence option; the administering Power campaigned hard for its preferred option; the opponents of the referendum were severely restricted in presenting their case; the presence of 8 000 French forces  together with police violence against peaceful demonstrations  were inhibiting factors. It was a hollow and sterile exercise.It was no wonder that the great majority of the indigenous people did not take part in such a flawed process. In fact  over 80 per cent of Kanaks stayed away from the polls.The only lesson to be drawn from this poll - and it is one which we must ell deeply regret - is that the basic differences in New Caledonian society remain and have only widened. In our view the referendum resolved nothing  merely aggravating the situation. It is clear that the future of New Caledonia can be assured only by the involvement of those who have long-term residence in and commitment to the Territory. We look to the administering Power to bring about a process of dialogue leading to a free and genuine act of self-determination  consistent with the universally accepted principles and practices of the United Nations.Member countries of this Organization  so many of whom have achieved their own independence with the support of this body  should not need to be reminded that all peoples have the right to expect the General Assembly to stand by them in their quest for self-determination. New Caledonia must be seen in this wide historical perspective. The principles that must guide the Assembly in this instance are the very ones it has followed in other colonial situations. They are contained in the draft resolution from the Special Committee of 24 the Assembly will consider later this session. The principles are clear and unambiguous. Attempts to side-step them do a disservice to us all. The Forum members will approach discussion of the New Caledonia item later in this session  guided by these principles.May God guide you in your deliberations."
"148",7503,"YEM",42,1987,"It gives me pleasure at the outset  Sir  to congratulate you on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic on your election to the presidency of this forty-second session of the General Assembly. There is no doubt that the eminent qualities which you possess and your diplomatic skill will greatly contribute to ensuring the success of our deliberations. I wish to reaffirm to you that my delegation will spare no effort in co-operating with you so as to crown your mission with success.It also gives me pleasure to express  through you  our sincere appreciation of your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  who achieved resounding success in guiding the deliberations of the last session.I am also pleased to congratulate  in my own name and on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of our Organization  on his worthy endeavors in the service of this Organization and its objectives in maintaining international peace and security. I wish him further success in the great tasks entrusted to him by the Assembly  the Security Council and other bodies of the United Nations.The forty-second session is taking place while preparations are under way for the third summit meeting of the two super-Powers  following their summit meetings in Geneva and Reykjavik  which coincided with the two previous sessions of the General Assembly. The agreement in principle achieved by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union and the Secretary of State of the United States of America concerning the final elimination of short- and intermediate-range missiles is a positive move which my country has supported and which we consider to be a step on the right path towards the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.We feel  however  that the long-awaited detente in international relations continues to be far from being reached  since the weapons to be eliminated under such an agreement constitute only a very modest proportion of the weapons in the possession of the two super-Powers and in their nuclear stockpiles - merely 3 per cent. Furthermore  the arms race remains as intense as ever. Tension and mistrust and recourse to force to resolve disputes continue to endanger international relations in many parts of the world.Though the last two summit meetings did not arrive at radical solutions for many of the problems which are alarming our world  we still cherish the hope that the forthcoming summit will yield more positive results that will make it possible to arrive at definitive solutions such as the halting of the arms race  the elimination of nuclear weapons  the permanent demilitarization of outer space  the reduction of tension and reassertion of the rights of the deprived peoples.My country wishes to express its support for the Political Declaration of the Eighth Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in September 1986 in Harare. In particular we wish to highlight the parts of that statement concerning disarmament and international security.My delegation supports the Soviet Union's call for the final elimination of nuclear weapons by all nuclear-weapon States by the end of the century  in addition to the repeated calls made by six countries - Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and Tanzania - on 23 May 1984  28 January 1985 and 7 August 1986  all of which advocate a halt to nuclear-weapon testing  the consolidation of the economic role of the United Nations and the diversion of the resources consumed by the arms race to socio-economic development  for most of the developing countries are in dire need of them.The Yemen Arab Republic believes that the Program for the militarization of outer space means new perils for humanity  perils it can well do without. My country believes that such Programs should be reviewed in the talks on general and complete disarmament  which should be pursued in a constructive and responsible spirit.The Yemen Arab Republic reiterates its rejection of any military presence in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea and again expresses its support for transforming the Indian Ocean region into a zone of permanent peace and security  free from nuclear weapons. We also support all efforts aimed at creating nuclear-free zones in other parts of the world  foremost among them the Middle East region  which is fraught with danger and simmering with constant tension.The conflict which has been raging in the Middle East for over 39 years can be attributed essentially to the Palestinian question. The region will remain explosive and peace and security will be threatened  not only in the Middle East but also in the world at large  as long as Israel maintains its unremitting intransigence and its insistence on continuing its occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories  its denial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  its aggressive policies against the people of Palestine and other Arab countries  and its brutal practices of repression and terrorism  basing itself on the direct political and military support it receives from the United States of America and other allies.It is perhaps not necessary to trace the historical chronology of the implantation of Israel in the heart of the Arab homeland and examine what danger this poses nor do we need to enumerate Israel's aggressive racist and settlement policies in the region  from the usurpation of Palestine to the wars of aggression waged against the Arab countries  the aggression against Lebanon in 1982 - which is continuing to this day - and the repeated acts of provocation and attacks against neighboring countries.It is hardly necessary to remind the Assembly of the various resolutions adopted by the Organization on the Palestinian question and the Middle East conflict  or of Israel's continuing rejection of all those resolutions and its blatant defiance of the international community. That would be merely to state the obvious. It is more important that we focus on a significant reality that has been reaffirmed by developments in the Palestinian question over the past four decades. ?he time has come for the international community to realize that no initiative  effort or arrangement aimed at arriving at a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement in the Middle East will ever be successful without recognition of the rational  legitimate  inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the light to return to their homeland  to self-determination and to establish an independent State on their national soil  under the leadership of their sole  legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).Some may feel that unilateral solutions are the right means of resolving the Palestinian question and the Middle East conflict. However  the recent past has provided daily reaffirmation of the fallaciousness of such a belief. The Camp avid accords and separate initiatives have only complicated the issue  distancing t even further from a just solution  because such attempts ignore the national lights of the Palestinian people. Hence  the Yemen Arab Republic continues to maintain that the solution of the Palestinian question and the Middle East conflict can be found only in an international conference on peace in the Middle East  to be attended by the five permanent members of the Security Council and all the parties concerned  on a footing of equality  including the PLO  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Such a conference would constitute the practical framework for and a sound and suitable step towards a just and lasting peace in the region.It is more necessary than ever before that the countries that maintain special relations with Israel - foremost among which is the United States - reconsider their partial attitude to Israel and their policies in the region in an attempt to contribute to a solution in a more positive and effective manner  with a view to arriving at a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the region.The Yemen Arab Republic follows with deep sorrow and alarm developments in the war that has been raging for seven years between Iran and Iraq. It expresses its profound apprehension and alarm at recent developments  which threaten a conflagration and the internationalization of the war as a result of Iran's rejection of the peaceful resolution of the conflict  its continuing attacks against Iraq and its occupation of Iraqi territory  as well as the escalation of its attacks on parties not involved in the conflict.The international community in general welcomed Security Council resolution 598 (1987)   of 20 July 1987  because it sets out the correct path to an honorable settlement and the ending of the war between Iran and Iraq while protecting the rights of both parties. However  we find ourselves facing a refusal by Iran to comply with that resolution. We therefore call upon all countries  especially the members  including the five permanent members of the Security Council  to play their role in the maintenance of international peace and security and uphold thereputation and prestige of our Organization by implementing that resolution comprehensively and completely so as to put an end to this war and preserve international peace and security in the region.At the same time  we call once again upon Iran to heed reason  abandon its recalcitrance  accept Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and have recourse to peaceful means to end the conflict. The continuance of this futile war constitutes in unprecedentedly serious threat to international peace and security  with unforeseeable consequences.The Yemen Arab Republic has followed attentively the latest round of negotiations on the question of Afghanistan  in Geneva  under the auspices of the assistant Secretary-General  and believes that the continuing failure to solve this issue is very serious. We maintain that the necessary elements of a just solution ire: negotiations between all the countries concerned  the return of the Afghan refugees  the ending of all forms of outside interference in the affairs of Afghanistan  whatever the purpose may be and recognition of the right of the Afghan people to sovereignty and to choose their own social and political system  free from outside influence.With regard to the question of Cyprus  we believe that negotiation and dialog are the best means of finding a satisfactory formula for ensuring freedom f religion and equality of rights and duties for both Cypriot communities  while reserving the unity and independence of Cyprus.The current situation in southern Africa is even more threatening than formerly as a result of the increasingly aggressive actions of the racist regime in Pretoria  which continues to reveal its true hideousness by its acts of repression  terrorism  butchery  torture and arbitrary arrest in confronting the nationalist uprisings in southern Africa. This is also revealed in the continuing occupation of Namibia  Pretoria's relentless attacks against the African front-line States and its blackmailing of other neighboring countries.The Yemen Arab Republic continues to follow developments in southern Africa and reaffirms its support for the legitimate struggle of the peoples of South Africa to attain their national rights. We condemn all illegitimate acts by the racist regime in South Africa against the national majority in South Africa and denounce all aggressive acts against the African front-line States. My country stresses the need to impose more effective economic sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa. We reaffirm our complete support for the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  their authentic representative  in their legitimate struggle for independence and freedom.The presence of the item on Namibia on the agenda of the General Assembly for the past 41 years  since the adoption of resolution 65 (I) at the first session of the General Assembly  in 1946  presents a great challenge to the international community and makes it incumbent upon it to exert effective  constructive efforts to solve this problem. We believe that the correct procedure lies in implementation of the peace settlement endorsed in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).If the situations in the Middle East  the Persian Gulf and southern Africa are threats to international peace and security  the situation in Central America is no less menacing. The Yemen Arab Republic  having followed with great attention the recent developments in Central America  wishes to express its support for the peace plan put forward by the Heads of five States  the aim of which is to restore permanent peace in the region free from outside interference and surmounting the complications inherent in the existing situation.With regard to the problems afflicting other parts of the world  we believe that the ideal way of resolving disputes and differences is by peaceful means and through dialog  enabling the peoples involved to express their will without outside pressure  allowing them their right to self-determination  and halting all outside intervention on whatever pretext.Although the matters I have just mentioned constitute part of the subjects that call for our attention today  there is another matter that is no less important. I am referring to the continuing deterioration in the international economic situation and the resultant great imbalance  due to the setting of the prices of raw materials and to the indebtedness with which the developing countries are overburdened  as well as to the technological monopoly of the industrialized countries  which widens and deepens the abyss separating the industrialized and developing worlds. That situation portends the total collapse of the present economic  financial and monetary order.We believe that to escape from this vicious circle a new international economic order must be established  in order to provide fair and adequate prices for the exports of the developing countries. Those countries must be enabled to play a greater role in orienting the international monetary system towards the financing of development and towards increasing their production in the industrial field through the transfer of technology  better debt terms  sovereignty over their own natural resources and a consolidation of the United Nations role in international economic co-operation. It is incumbent upon us to devote increased efforts towards achieving the new international economic order based on equality among all countries  with balance and justice in all sectors.The developing countries have submitted a number of proposals designed to overcome the world economic crisis:	the	Caracas	plan of action  the principles setforth at Buenos Aires  the Cairo Declaration and the Economic Declaration issued at the Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held at Harare in September 1986. Because our world needs greater interdependence and integration  an objective response from the industrialized world  based on a comprehensive vision of the dimensions of the crisis  could bring prosperity for all mankind.The Yemen Arab Republic  while giving due attention to world economic problems  continues to give its attention to many of the world's social and humanitarian problems as well. In this connection my delegation reaffirms the need for the international community to give greater attention to implementing the World Program of Action concerning Disabled Persons and to observing the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons  and the need to give greater attention to the situation of refugees and to implementation of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women  along with other social and humanitarian issues.The Government and people of the Yemen Arab Republic recently celebrated the silver anniversary of the 26 September 1962 Revolution. In those celebrations we were joined by a number of friendly and fraternal countries. Our celebration takes place at a time' when the Yemeni people have made great forward strides in all areas - social  political and economic. This is attested to by many of those who knew Yemen prior to its Revolution. The choice of democracy as one of the objectives of our glorious Revolution is one of our people's most important victories  and it will culminate in free and direct parliamentary elections to be led at the beginning of next year in keeping with the guiding principles established by our political leadership  represented by brother Colonel Ali tbdulla Saleh  President of the Republic  Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces ind General Secretary of the People's General Congress. Our country enjoys security and stability and has made great progress. The beginning of the first ear of the third five-year plan  1987-1991  represents a new phase of elf-reliance during which we will export the first shipment of Yemeni oil from the shores of the Red Sea.As for Yemen's unity  our national leadership is working with our brothers in he southern part of our homeland in order to achieve unity through peaceful and democratic means and to realize the hopes and aspirations of the Yemeni people.In conclusion  I would ask the Almighty to guide you  Mr. President  to success on your way  and I pray for the progress of our Organization in the service if freedom  justice  prosperity and equality  unimpeded by considerations of color  creed or race. All members of the human race must live as equals on this earth  however diverse their cultures  however far-flung their geographical locations. Peace will never prevail without equality  security and stability in our world  and this cannot be realized without justice for all."
"149",7550,"YUG",42,1987,"﻿I have pleasure. Sir  in congratulating you cordially  as the representative of the friendly German Democratic Republic  on your election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly  ľ assure you of the readiness of my delegation to co-operate with you fully throughout this session. I should also like to express our sincere appreciation to the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  Mr. Choudhury  for the able manner in which he presided over the previous General Assembly session.We all owe special appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who continues to make his important contribution to the efforts of the United Nations to deal with the most acute world problems.Year after year  in this same Hall  we have been making and hearing sombre assessments of the international situation  because it could only be described as it actually was. Until recently it seemed that the period of apprehension and uncertainty would never end and that the vicious circle of rivalry and confrontation would persist in spite of all our efforts.It is encouraging that today we have reason to believe that changes are in the making  because the process of dialogue  negotiation and the search for ways out of the exacerbated international situation in the world has been initiated and is evolving. The positive consequences of this process  which is opening up genuine  prospects for understanding in fields in which this was inconceivable only a short while ago  are already being felt in a certain easing of international tension and constitute a sound basis for hope of a more tranquil world and of new development prospects.True  confrontation continues  but there is also ever wider dialogue on an increasing number of issues. There is a stronger orientation towards negotiation with a view to resolving the accumulated problems of the world. The conviction that mutual agreement and confidence-building provide the only course that can promise the world a future is gaining ground. Every step forward in any field of International relations provides an Impetus to progress in others.Initial results in the field of arms reduction are at hand. After more than four decades of nuclear build-up  the world la on the threshold of an agreement on specific measures for partial nuclear disarmament. This is a chance which must not be missed. History would never forgive anyone for preventing this great step towards a better future for all. The forthcoming agreement is  naturally  just the beginning of the long road to complete nuclear disarmament. Its historic importance  however  lies in the fact that it offers real chances of re-channelling International trends in a direction that is in the interest of all nations.This is a moment which requires  maybe more than ever before  wisdom  foresight and courage on the part of us all. The elimination of all weapons capable of annihilating mankind and all the achievements of civilization must be our objective. That would mean victory for the realization that we can only live together and in co-operation and that aspirations to supremacy guarantee survival to no one. On this occasion  my country would like to pay a tribute to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America for their constructive efforts  which will  we trust  shortly yield valuable results. Many years of aspirations  demands  appeals  efforts and contributed by individuals and organizations have been directed towards this goal  which is within reach and which I believe  indeed  we have reached. It is with satisfaction that we note that such developments are an important step towards adopting the stances which the Non-aligned Movement has been advocating incessantly and perseveringly for over a quarter of a century and which were reiterated in the appeal addressed to the leaders of the United States and the USSR by the summit meeting in Harare. In this connection I should like to point out that  like many others  we are of the opinion that even stronger efforts are required on the part of all in order for the process of disarmament to embrace all types of weapons and all regions of the world. It is our judgement that in Geneva we have come closer to adopting a convention on the total ban of chemical weapons. All the conditions exist for taking that important step through the earliest possible adoption of the convention.I have already said that an atmosphere of negotiation and agreement facilitates the initiation of a genuine process for the resolution of other crucial problems of international relations. It both sets the conditions and demands our greatest commitment. There are some encouraging signs that some of the crises in various parts of the world which have become a part of our lives and the escalation of which we have feared for years and decades are entering a stage at which solutions are being sought in line with the Interests of the countries and peoples directly involved  as with the interests well as of the International community at large.It is with pleasure that I call attention to the wise and courageous act of five Central American countries which  in the spirit of the efforts of the Contadora Group and with the support of the whole of Latin America  have made a historic contribution to the peace process in their region. The adoption of the peace plan is the result of the constructive efforts of the countries of Latin America to find solutions to their own problems through their own means and actions. Such an approach has always enjoyed the support of the non-aligned countries.We believe it is high time - and also that the situation is now more favourable - to begin solving the Middle East crisis. The proposal for an international conference to be held under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties directly concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and others who have a useful contribution to make  is a sound and realistic move on the road towards peace which is gaining growing recognition in the world. I believe that at this session we should take a resolute step towards the earliest possible convening of such a conference.We are deeply convinced that the only just  permanent and comprehensive solution is one that would ensure the withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967  including Jerusalem  the exercise of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and to the establishment of a State of their own  and recognition of the right of all the States of the region to security and autonomous social development. That would call for patient efforts on the part of all the countries and all the factors in the region. The non-aligned countries  through the activities of their Committee of Nine for the Middle East and Palestine  are striving to promote conditions for the holding of such a conference and to mobilize all the elements that are ready to contribute to thatAlthough the causes of the crises in south-east and south-west Asia have not yet been eliminated  there are certain developments which give rise to hopes and expectations. We attach importance to the dialogue on solutions that would ensure the rights of the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea to independence and free development on the basis of the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops  without foreign presence  intervention and interference from any side whatsoever. World public opinion demands that there be no hesitation in this respect and that this process should not be impeded in any way. The resolution on ending the war between Iraq and Iran adopted unanimously by the Security Council is in our opinion a sound basis for a just and lasting solution. It also highlights the importance of the effectiveness of the United Nations. None the less  the war goes on. Its continuation and the entry of foreign Powers into the Gulf have created an explosive situation which could spark off broader conflagrations and even jeopardize peace in this region and in the whole world still further. We are witnessing dangerous incidents every day. We therefore sincerely hope that the sides in this conflict will as soon as possible! seize the opportunity offered by the Security Council resolution for ending the war and creating conditions for the restoration and peaceful development of their countries. We give our full support to the exceptional efforts that the Secretary-General has been making to that end. We also appeal to all other factors to contribute thereto.Some world crises have  however  further deteriorated. This applies primarily to southern Africa  where the apartheid regime continues its blood-bath against the majority population and jeopardizes the independence of neighbouring countries. Developments show once again that no changes can be expected without resolute action on the part of the entire international community. The only remaining peaceful means that remain for liquidating the shameful system of apartheid and for the immediate termination of the occupation of Namibia are comprehensive sanctions against the racist regime in Pretoria.Similarly  we cannot but voice our concern over the lack of progress in resolving the problem of Cyprus. It should also be noted with regret that the situation on the Korean peninsula remains unchanged. The non-aligned countries continue to urge a lasting and just settlement of all those crises  in line with the comprehensive programme of action in the struggle for peace and development adopted at their Summit Conference in Harare last year. The initiative of the non-aligned countries of the Mediterranean - an area beset by crises but also an area with a great potential for the development of co-operation - should be viewed in that context.At their Ministerial Meeting held at Brioni  Yugoslavia  in June this year  11 Mediterranean members of the Non-aligned Movement unequivocally opted for the development of co-operation among the non-aligned and European Mediterranean and other countries  with a view to easing tensions and creating more favourable conditions for resolving crises in that sensitive geopolitical region. Agreements and concrete measures for confidence building and arms reduction in Europe should involve the Mediterranean as well  since peace and security in those two regions are inseparably linked. At Brioni the non-aligned countries launched an initiative for establishing an organized dialogue with the Mediterranean countries of Europe. The interest of those countries in dialogue  which opens up new prospects of co-operation among countries on all the Mediterranean shores  has been confirmed in the initial contacts and exchanges of opinion carried out with those countries by Yugoslavia under the mandate of the Brioni meeting. Yugoslavia attaches exceptional importance to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as a process based on democratic principles and the full equality of all participating countries. The Vienna meeting  which is now entering its decisive stage  stands a realistic chance of producing significant results provided that all participants demonstrate political responsibility and realism and take account of the interests of all European countries.Proceeding from the importance of regional co-operation for a positive process on a broader international scale as well  Yugoslavia has taken the initiative in the convening of a meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Balkan countries. It is our desire through constructive dialogue and concerted effort to encourage multilateral co-operation among the countries of this European and Mediterranean region in various fields of obvious common interests  and in that way to build an atmosphere of mutual understanding and contribute to overcoming the burdensome legacies of the past  and encourage bilateral and multilateral relations of good-neighbourliness and co-operation  as this is of vital interest to all Balkan peoples and countries.The encouraging signs seen in certain areas of international relations are regrettably not yet visible in the sphere of international economic relations  where all the contradictions of the modern world are manifesting themselves in an increasingly acute way. All economic and other divisions persist  while the gulf between the industrialized world and the world of the underdeveloped countries continues to widen dramatically. Unfortunately  in the case of this sphere of international relations we can only repeat the negative assessments and profound concerns that have been expressed time and again.We are firmly convinced that the positive achievements in the field of disarmament and the relaxation of international tension could have a more lasting impact on international relations overall if they were accompanied by steps towards settling international economic problems  improving the position of developing countries and above all  resolving the debt problem.The most serious manifestation of the depth of the contradictions in current world economic relations is the phenomenon of the vast debts of the developing countries. Exceeding $1 trillion  they account for over 40 per cent of the developing countries' gross product. Under the burden of debt servicing  the drop in commodity prices and deteriorating terms of trade  there has been a drastic drain of capital from the developing countries  resulting in their impoverishment.An adjustment policy which does not ensure faster development and which cannot rely on radically more favourable debt-repayment terms cannot redress the situation  which is becoming more and more difficult. Debtor countries are unable in spite of their efforts to repay their debts under existing conditions. Their debt-servicing capacities are declining from year to year. The fulfilment of their obligations is less a question of their willingness than  increasingly  a question of their objective inability to do so. Therefore  a way out of the debt crisis cannot be found without concerted action on the part of both debtors and creditors  that is to say Governments  international financial institutions and commercial banks. A solution can be found only by creating conditions for the accelerated development of the developing countries and by radically improving debt-repayment terms.A framework for further action in the United Nations along those lines is provided by the agenda item entitled ""External debt crisis and development"". Last year the Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution on strengthening international economic co-operation aimed at solving the external debt problems of developing countries. That act confirmed the global nature of the debt problem and emphasized the shared responsibility of both debtors and creditors for its settlement. We expect to be in a position this year to go a step beyond that resolution  as a reflection of the gravity of the problem itself.I would recall that the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development established the manifold interdependence between those two key problems of today. It also recommended the further study of avenues for diverting part of the vast resources invested each year in the maintenance of existing weapons and research on and production of new ones to the creation of general developmental opportunities  particularly in developing countries.We are convinced that  by its very nature  the revolutionary progress made by science and technology  with achievements undreamed-of only recently  recognizes no boundaries  no geographic  political or ideological barriers or divisions. The accomplishments of the human mind  regardless of where they were made  have to be made accessible to all countries and peoples under equal conditions. Technological achievements must be put in the service of the development of all  and must not be withheld from developing countries  which need them so badly.The protection of the environment is becoming an ever more topical problem of the present-day world. The report of the commission chaired by the Prime Minister of Norway  Mrs. Brundtland  which particularly emphasizes the link between development and the environment  deserves our special recognition.The crossroads the world has reached and the chances we are offered to enter a new era of international relations make the United Nations the place where all interests  all aspirations and all views are reflected  the only forum where equal and democratic decision-making on our common destiny is possible. Now is the time for us through our endeavours to enable the world Organization to discharge as efficiently as possible the tasks for which we founded it  rather than undermining its authority and role with objections because we have not been able to achieve through it each and every individual interest.We must all  regardless of the groupings we belong to and the political convictions we profess  unequivocally  resolutely and consistently apply ourselves to the development of co-operation on the broadest possible basis and to the promotion of a spirit of solidarity and understanding  rather than vying with each other to prove our own excellence and insisting that our own road is the only possible one and that it should be followed by all. In this world of ours  and even in this Organization  there is no one who can claim that no improvements could be made in his country and its international activities or that matters could not be dealt with in a more democratic and progressive manner. We must not stop at the first positive results in the relaxation of international tensions. We paid a high price before it was realized that we cannot hope for  or move steadily towards  a better future if we are bound by ideas and concepts that pull us back. The beginning of the nuclear disarmament process will be fully validated if it is continued and followed by the resolution of the grave economic problems of the world  the overcoming of crises and the steady democratisation of international relations. This can and should be contributed to by all countries - the big  the middle-sized  the small and the smallest  the most developed  the developed and the underdeveloped  the aligned and the non-aligned - by all countries  all peoples  all organizations of goodwill and noble intentions.Peace  security and development are integrally linked. Only together can they provide the opportunity for us to build a world in which tranquillity will prevail over fear  prosperity over want  equality and tolerance over violence - a world in which the dignity of nations and peoples will be universally and fully respected.I hope that during this session as well we will take decisions that will  at least in some respects  bring us closer to these lofty goals to fulfilment of which my country is wholeheartedly committed  inspired by the tenets and policy of non-alignment."
"150",7614,"ZMB",42,1987,"﻿ On behalf of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and on behalf of Zambia  I join all other speakers in congratulating you.Ambassador Florin  on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. In doing so  I want to assure you of the co-operation of the African member States  and at the same time register our strong appreciation for the work done by your predecessor  Mr. Choudhury  Foreign Minister of Bangladesh.Further  I congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuellar  on his outstanding and excellent leadership of this Organization. I also feel very honoured to express our special and deep gratitude to him for his presence at and valuable contribution to the twenty-third OAU summit meeting  held at Addis Ababa  Ethiopia  from 27 to 29 July 1987.I would have preferred to carry a lighter and happier message on behalf of Africa  but that is not so because this session is taking place against the background of a worsening international situation. While the arms race rages on we are today witnessing with increasing frequency and intensity the creation of more hotbeds of tension in the world.Africa is gravely concerned about this. We therefore hope that this session will help find solutions to some of the numerous problems confronting the world. We firmly believe that this can be done only through collective  concerted effort. That is the basis of our commitment to the United Nations. That is why we are here  sharing our concerns with the rest of the Member States.A little over a year ago  at its thirteenth special session  the General Assembly unanimously adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-199Ü. That Programme is a unique framework for co-operation between Africa and the rest of the international community to bring about Africa's economic recovery. Convinced that such a task should begin in earnest and without fail  African Heads of State and Government collectively adopted in 1985 Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990  and pledged to assume primary responsibility in its implementation.By adopting the United Nations Programme of Action  the international community endorsed Africa's Priority Programme  acknowledged the need to create a more supportive international economic environment  and pledged to make every effort to provide sufficient resources to support African development initiatives. On our side  we committed ourselves to respect  at the national level  the priorities of Africa's Priority Programme  to continue vigorously to pursue appropriate policy reforms and fully to mobilize domestic resources for the successful implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action.We have made strides during the past months of Africa's Priority Programme in reordering our economic priorities. We have introduced painful economic reforms and adjustments  and stabilization measures  often at tremendous economic and social cost and in the face of serious political risks  which in many a country have threatened the very foundations of social confession and political stability.All this has been taking place at a time when a number of countries are experiencing continued or re-emerging drought problems and emergency situations  threatening once again to drain and divest scarce national resources that are badly needed for recovery and development. The recovery and development efforts in the southern African region have been and continue to be frustrated by the racist regime of-South Africa and its- continued policies of aggression and political and economic destabilization. These policies have exacted tremendous financial and human costs and totally undermined peace  stability and security which are the very prerequisites for economic recovery and development.	.But  in spite of all the formidable difficulties and costs  Africa has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate its unswerving commitment to the United Nations economic recovery Programme. To us Africans the implementation of that Programme has been simply a matter of survival and a challenge to recover and develop; and we are determined to survive and grow.Regrettably  one cannot but conclude that almost one and a half years after the adoption of the Programme  and despite some limited initiatives here and there  the international community's overall response has fallen far short of the requirements of the Programme. The international community has not lived up to its side of the recovery pact.Our assessment of the situation is amply supported by the findings in the comprehensive and excellent progress report of the Secretary-General which is before us. This is also the assessment of a large body of distinguished African and non-African policy-makers  experts and representatives of international. United Nations and non-governmental organizations  who met recently in Nigeria at an international conference sponsored by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)  in co-operation with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Development Bank. That group of policy-makers  experts and others set out to assess African's chances of recovery and development as embodied in the Abuļa Statement  which is also before this session. Indeed  it is also the assessment of other major international organizations and a number of Western governments. In addition to the failure of the international community  particularly the States members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) r to respond adequately  the external economic environment has become further aggravated. In one year alone  1985 to 19B6  Africa lost as much as $US 19 billion in export earnings as a result of the collapse of commodity prices. In 1986 terms of trade deteriorated by 28 per cent and the purchasing power of its exports fell by 3 0 per cent.The debt and debt-servicing problems have also assumed alarming dimensions. By the end of 1986 Africa's debt had reached $US 200 billion  amounting to 54 per cent of the gross domestic product and almost 440 per cent of export earnings. Debt-service ratios to exports now exceed 50 per cent and are much higher for many countries. The scheduled debt-service payments exceed $US 15 billion. The situation is so critical that many countries have had to stop payment altogether  and a special summit meeting of the Heads of State of OAU  to be held on 30 November and I December 1987  will specifically discuss this problem.The dramatic fall in export earnings and the huge debt-service payments represent transfers from Africa of precious financial resources which could have been used to engineer economic recovery. The African countries pledged finance of about 63 per cent of the African Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990 from domestic sources on the assumption of stable commodity prices  so that the revenue and household income derived there from could in turn be stable and assured. That assumption went with the wind during the very first year after the adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action. Very little  if any  action has been taken by the international community to ameliorate the debilitating effects of the adverse external environment. No measures are in sight to stabilize export earnings from commodities  which are of major interest to Africa nor have effective mechanisms been put in place to deal with the unmanageable debt and debt-servicing burdens in any meaningful way. Worse still  the anticipated increase in the resource flows to Africa has not materialized. Not only have they not matched the resource outflows from Africa; they have actually stagnated. Standing at $US 10 billion in 1986  total resource flows to Africa in real terms were below the 1985 level. Thus  while Africa lost about $US 34 billion in outward transfers in 1986 alone as a result of the fall in export earnings and of debt-service payments  the net Income resource flows could compensate for only a little more than half of that loss.It is thus clear that Africa has been losing on all counts  to the extent that one wonders whatever happened to the commitment the international community entered into in the United Nations economic recovery Programme for Africa and to the spirit of co-responsibility and mutuality of interest and why it has not translated itself into concrete actions.This session should  inter alia  take stock to the extent to which our mutual undertakings have been honoured and spell out what needs to be done during the remaining life span of that Programme  if it is to be successfully implemented.Although the word ""compact"" has not been used in the Programme of Action  the new partnership based  as it were  on a mutual commitment and shared responsibility between Africa and the international community is nothing short of a compact for development and progress in Africa  It also symbolizes the restoration of faith in the efficacy of international economic co-operation in support of Africa Of course we Africans know only too well that we have to be the masters of our own destiny and that we have to sustain domestic policy reforms  continue the efforts to improve economic management as long as it takes  and also concentrate all the adopted priorities to bring about the necessary change in the structure of our economies  to pursue self-reliant and self-sustaining development and to strengthen economic co-operation and integration in Africa.Having said that  it is also true - and this needs to be stressed in very clear terms - that these efforts  no matter how relentlessly they are pursued  would be futile without genuine improvement in the external economic environment and without the adequate support of the international community. Unless effective solutions are found for the debt and commodity problems and unless resource flows at levels adequate to compensate for the outward transfer of resources away from Africa and also to allow for a meaningful positive per capita growth rate are ensured  prospects for bringing about recovery and development in Africa will become forever elusive and the continent will forever be a victim of the vagaries and misery of perpetual crisis.		The case for external support to Africa does not primarily rest on moral grounds  as some of us would like to portray it. It does not. The hard evidence clearly shows that a perverse massive transfer of resources out of Africa is currently taking place. These outflows must be stopped and reversed through resource inflows that would also take into account the requirements of growth.However  one is aware of and grateful for some initiatives by some donor and creditor Governments to provide a variety of debt-relief measures and special assistance programmes. These measures include the rescheduling of official debt through the Paris Club on more generous terms and of private commercial debt through the London Club. Some donor countries have also cancelled other debts in favour of some least developed African countries.We also welcome the recent decision at the Venice Summit that consideration should be given to the possibility of applying lower interest rates to the existing debts of those African countries that are undertaking adjustment efforts and that agreement should be reached  especially in the Paris Club  on longer repayment and grace periods.Some initiatives have also been taken by Multilateral institutions to increase the volume of their assistance to Africa. Worthy of mention here are the replenishment of resources from the International Development Agency (IDA) amounting to US$ 12.4 billion and the decision to allocate 45 per cent thereof to sub-Sahara Africa.Also notable is the recent proposal by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the resources available for the restructural adjustment facility be tripled to $9 billion in special drawing rights from 1 January in order to provide special support to poor countries facing extraordinary balance-of-payments problems. However  appreciable as these efforts are  they only represent partial approaches to the problem in hand and do by far fall short of the requirements of Africa.What is required is a package that includes solutions to the debt and commodity problems and a substantial increase in official development assistance (ODA). Such a package should include the conversion of all debts into grants  a substantial reduction and cutting of interest rates on commercial debts and the consolidation of these debts and the debt-service payments due thereon into long-term loans repayable over 30 to 40 years on concessional terms  allowing for a 10-year period of grace. The resultant debt-servicing requirements must be fully compatible with the capacity to pay of African countries  after fully taking into account the requirements of sustained growth and development.A solution should be found to the mounting debt of African countries to the IMF and the World Bank. There is now a substantial net outflow of resources from Africa to the IMF. It is estimated that in 19d6 the net outflow of resources from Africa to the IMF amounted to over $US 960 million. Such a situation is unsustainable  unjustifiable and illogical. We should ensure that the IMF and the World Bank can reschedule  on a long-term basis  the repayment of the debt owed to it by Africa and the debt-servicing obligations.The urgent need to deal with the problems of African commodities can hardly be overstressed. The dramatic fall in export earnings and the continuous deterioration of Africa's terms of trade have not only made a mockery of any attempts to increase the volume of exports but also they starved the African economies of a major source of investment funds.We should translate into specific action the call on the international community in the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1906-1990""To deal urgently with commodity issues  taking into account the special interests of the African countries ... and also to increase the capacity of African countries to process  market  distribute and transport their exports""  (resolution S-13/2  annex  para. 17(b)(ii))Support for and the stabilization at reasonably remunerative prices of the earnings from commodities of primary interest to Africa are an important area for specific action. In this regard  the recent proposal by the Economic Commission for Africa (EGA)   which was also taken up by the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to expand donor participation in these matters and systems to include the other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) donor countries deserves special attention. In addition to providing solutions to these problems  the package must ensure the flow of concessional resources to Africa at levels adequate to compensate for any outward transfer of resources as well as to meet the requirements of sustained growth at meaningful levels.Over and above this  $US 9.1 billion per annum are still needed from external sources to finance Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990. The requirements of the African development programmes  which go beyond the requirements of the Priority Programme  are much larger.The international community should shoulder its responsibility to face the problems of Africa squarely and provide the kind of lasting solutions that I have just mentioned. The efforts to initiate concrete action have failed to take off  because of the opposition of a few major countries. I appeal to them  in the name of humanity and in the name of international solidarity  to join hands with other countries in the full implementation by the international community of our joint economic recovery Programme for Africa. The problem of the environment is a matter of grave concern to mankind as a whole. We in Africa attach great importance to the urgency of this global issue. It is in that context that we welcome the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development  which was presented to the twenty-third ordinary summit meeting of the OAU. It is worth noting in particular that  while the Commission recognized that pollution largely constitutes a northern or urban problem. ""poverty is the main cause of environmental degradation in many developing countries"".I commend that report to the Assembly  and at the same time I wish to the Chairman of the Commission  the Prime Minister of Norway for it  and also for coming to address our summit meeting in Addis Ababa  the twenty-third session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of Africa.The political situation on the African continent is no better than the economic scene. Western Sahara continues to be an area of conflict. The Organization of African Unity supports the efforts now being made by the United Nations Secretary-General to bring about a cease-fire and a referendum. We call earnestly on both the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco to support the Secretary-General in his efforts. As in the past  the OAU will do all in its power to assist.The dispute between Libya and Chad has not yet been settled  but we are consulting among ourselves within the framework of the Organization of African Unity in an effort to find a lasting solution to the problem. The ad Hoc Committee  which held its first meeting in Lusaka last month  is continuing its efforts to find a solution to the problem. In this regard  we strongly appeal to the wider international community to refrain from such action as will further complicate the situation.The volatile and worsening situation in southern Africa  at the root of which is the evil system of apartheid in South Africa  continues to be a matter of grave concern to us. This world body has condemned apartheid and has rightly declared it a crime against humanity. Numerous appeals have been made to the regime in Pretoria to abolish this most cruel system of racial discrimination - but to no avail. Instead  the racist regime has responded by strengthening its repressive machinery and enforcing apartheid with even greater brutality. The racist Pretoria regime has  among other things  refused to lift the state of emergency and has continued to muzzle the press through censorship.South Africa's aggression against neighbouring independent countries has increased. Furthermore  its destabilization of the front-line States through its sponsorship and control of anti-Government bandits  mercenary-led groups such as the MNR (Mozambique National Resistance) in Mozambique and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) in Angola  has been considerably stepped up. These bandit groups cannot lay any claim to credibility as the representative of the people in these countries - much less to any worthwhile cause. Their hallmarks are murder  plunder and wanton destruction and violence.Only recently  the South African-sponsored armed bandits added to their macabre record the cold-blooded massacre of hundreds of innocent women  children and old people at Homoine and elsewhere in Mozambique. The banditry of these  groups has caused much loss of life and property and unimaginable suffering and has Left permanent physical and psychological scars on the people of these countries. In Mozambique alone  an alarming number of children die as a result of this banditry. Hundreds of thousands of persons have had to flee from Mozambique and Angola  thus presenting a refugee problem of a magnitude that the region is finding difficult to cope with.Yet  even as I address the General Assembly  the racist regime's armed forces  supported by the bandits of UNITA  have invaded Angola. Only a few minutes before I came here  I received reliable information that the racist troops in Angola have now actually taken over from their bandits of ÜNITA  because the so-called headquarters of those bandits was about to fall to the Angolan patriotic forces. The South African racist regime's evil forces have now taken over complete control of the war situation in southern Angola. In short  they have actually now invaded Angola themselves. There is no longer any pretence about this. All this is a deliberate campaign to establish Bantustan-type governments in front-line States.Of course  in the end the racists cannot succeed. But how much bitterness are they building up against themselves in the hearts of all those young people  part of the future of mankind  who are now growing up witnessing this barbaric campaign by a primitive regime in the twentieth century.South Africa's destabilization of neighbouring countries is meant not only to turn them into Bantustans but also to force them to abandon their support for the struggle against apartheid. What the racist regime in Pretoria simply does not understand is that that struggle is not being waged from outside but is being fought and will be won by the oppressed peoples themselves right inside South Africa.There appears to be no indication at all of a willingness on the part of the racist regime to dismantle apartheid peacefully. But  as surely as night follows day  apartheid will be destroyed. It is not a question of if but of when and how apartheid will be ended. I want to emphasize that point: it is not a question of if but of when and how apartheid will be ended.We wish  therefore  to reiterate what has been stated before; In the context of the southern African situation  comprehensive and mandatory sanctions remain the only peaceful way - I might add  comparatively speaking - to end apartheid. Lest it be forgotten  I point out that the world has been warned by the Organization of African Unity and other bodies that failure by the international community to resolve this issue peacefully will result in unimaginable bloodshed and destruction.South Africa's bogus attempt at reform cannot be tolerated  because  as the farce of a tricameral parliament has shown  apartheid cannot be reformed. Furthermore as the impudence of the May 1986 whites-only elections loudly proclaimed  the racist regime is neither serious nor willing to negotiate the dismantling of apartheid. It is against that background that we should like to repeat our endless appeals to the major Western countries which have sufficient leverage over the racist regime to join the campaign for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the apartheid regime.In the absence of such sanctions  only revolutionary violence by the oppressed majority of South Africa will dismantle apartheid. The racist regime must be pressured to renounce the abominable system of apartheid and the ban on the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other political parties and organizations  lift the state of emergency  release Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and proceed to negotiate with the genuine representatives of the oppressed people for a non-racial and democratic government.Namibia constitutes another tragedy for this Organization and for the international community as a whole. A global consensus exists that South Africa is illegally occupying the Territory of Namibia. The International Court of Justice  the Security Council and  indeed  this Assembly have reaffirmed that global view. A great deal of energy  diplomatic effort and even money have been spent to remove the innumerable obstacles impeding the implementation of the United Nations plan approved In Security Council resolution 43b (1978). The world has anxiously been awaiting the implementation of that resolution. The momentum that existed in 1978 has completely waned in the wave of the impasse created by the linkage of the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola with Namibian independence.The OAU  the Non-Aligned Movement  the United Nations General Assembly itself and the Security Council have always maintained that the issue of linkage is extraneous to the Namibian question. We therefore request the Security Council immediately to face its responsibilities and enable the Secretary-General of the United Nations to proceed with the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).The international community has a duty to assist the front-line States and other independent States of the region in order to enable them to withstand South Africa's acts of aggression and destabilization. I also appeal for increased humanitarian assistance to the victims of apartheid  especially those who have been displaced from their homes.I note with profound dismay that although the principle of peaceful co-existence has been accepted as the foundation of the United Nations  the intense rivalry between the two super-Powers and their respective blocs  which is the major driving force behind the arms race  is a real threat to international peace and security. In a world where millions of people die of hunger and malnutrition every year  how can our conscience allow us to spend over US$ 1000 billion per annum on armaments? What sense is there in our continuing to acquire and perfect more and more nuclear weapons when existing arsenals can destroy the world many times over? How can we live in peace with nuclear weapons  which we cannot manage to keep safe even when we are not using them?Surely we owe it to ourselves and to posterity - and  indeed  to the millions who have died and continue to die of starvation  malnutrition and disease - to stop the arms race  especially the nuclear arms race  so that we can channel the resources released in that process to more worthwhile and life-supporting purposes. In this regard  we should like to appeal to the two super-Powers  which have a special responsibility seriously and urgently to negotiate with each other an arrangement that will lead to general and complete disarmament.In that vein  Zambia  and indeed the whole of Africa  welcomes with great relief and joy the recent announcement that the two super-Powers have reached agreement in principle to abolish all medium- and short-range missiles with a view to concluding an intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty. There is no doubt that the whole of mankind feels justly proud of that achievement at this historic moment. That agreement in principle reflects the patience  responsibility and great foresight that the two super-Powers have shown after long and difficult negotiations. Accordingly  we present our hearty congratulations to President Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.We know  however  that much more needs to be done. Much larger nuclear  chemical and conventional stockpiles remain. We therefore call on the United States and the Soviet Union to persist in their efforts to rid this earth of all nuclear and chemical weapons and significantly to reduce conventional armaments  in order to guarantee security for both sides and for the world at large.The Middle East continues to be an area of conflict. The Palestinian problem remains unresolved and now seriously affects Lebanon and its people. There is  however  a ray of hope - an international conference for peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. The OAU supports such a conference and calls on Israel to take full advantage of this historic opportunity to re-establish peace and secure borders for all in the Middle East. But for such a conference adequately to address all the issues of the area  it is imperative that the Palestine Liberation Organization attends as a full participating member. In this way  all the countries and peoples of the Middle East will commit themselves to the outcome of the conference.The war between Iran and Iraq has entered its eighth year. The cost in human lives and property has been very heavy for both countries. The concentration in the Gulf of forces alien to the region increases the probability that the war may expand beyond the present conflict. That conflict could expand and engulf the neighbouring States  and threaten the flow of oil from that region. The OAU is concerned about the war and about its menacing consequences  we believe that the road forward lies in ending the war. For that reason we welcome the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of its resolution 5УЬ (1987). That resolution may not have fully satisfied the demands of all concerned  but it provides a basis for a meaningful settlement of the problem. It is our understanding that Iraq has already accepted the resolution. We therefore join the international community in calling on Iran to do the same.The situation in Central America is also a source of worry to us. The peace and stability of that region can be assured only if the countries there are allowed to settle their own problems without external interference. We therefore support - and support fully - the Guatemala agreement recently signed by the five Presidents of the area. It is our hope that this will provide a basis for the settlement of all the outstanding issues.There are other areas of tension. I am referring here to Afghanistan  Cyprus  Kampuchea and the Korean peninsula. In all these areas the introduction of foreign troops has made it difficult for the people of those countries to establish peace for themselves without outside interference. We join with the rest of humanity in demanding that those countries be given the opportunity to determine their own future.The United Nations remains the most important multilateral institution for resolving international conflicts. It affords debate across ideologies and other human prejudices. It is a uniting factor. It must be preserved."
"151",7648,"ZWE",42,1987,"﻿First  Sir  I should like to extend my congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your election is a deserved tribute to your admirable diplomatic qualities and also a vote of confidence in your country. My delegation intends to co-operate fully with you as you guide the work of this Assembly.  To your predecessor  Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh  we extend our most sincere appreciation for the able manner in which he presided over the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. The Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar  has steered the ship of this Organization during very stormy weather and has done so splendidly. We is deserving of our unreserved praise and support. We welcome his report on the work of the Organization. The Secretary-General has ably outlined the problems  opportunities and challenges that lie ahead as we begin the forty-second session of the General Assembly. We sincerely hope that his important ideas will receive the serious consideration they deserve in the days to follow  as the Assembly tackles the items on its agenda.As we meet today  impulses for peace have quickened when compared to the position prevailing at the inauguration of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. Encouraging  if tentative and rather tantalizing  signs of a relaxation  of tension between super-Powers and on the international stage in general are discernible. Yet much too much is still unresolved for us to say peace is here at last. The international situation remains volatile and explosive and much can still go amiss. For that reason we should take very seriously the Secretary-General's words when he states that;""Even if the favourable wind felt this year prevails  our global vessel will need skilful piloting and the assistance of dedicated oarsmen to navigate the many shoals and reach safe landfall in the next century."" (A/42/1  p.2)For us to profit from the present thaw  it is necessary that we take every advantage of the possibilities before us to create an environment conducive to the search for peace world-wide. This forty-second session of the General Assembly provides us with one such opportunity. Let us seize and exploit it to the fullest possible extent.Our deliberations this session could not have started on a more auspicious note than that provided by the announcement two weeks ago by the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of an agreement in principle for the global elimination of land-based intermediate nuclear forces (INF). We welcome this positive development. It is the first time an agreement actually to reduce existing arsenals of nuclear forces has been made. It is therefore an important psychological breakthrough  not only because it will demonstrate  as we have always argued  that a reduction of armaments can actually create a sense of greater security among nations  but also because it will  we are convinced  expose the fallacy of trying to seek security in the arms race. We hope that  when signed and ratified  the INF agreement will give fresh impetus to continuing negotiations on other broader areas of disarmament aimed at the halting of the arms race  nuclear disarmament and ultimately general and complete disarmament. We urge the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union and  indeed  of all other nuclear-weapon States to seize these possibilities of our times  to proceed to agree on a moratorium on nuclear testing as a first step towards the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and the reduction and eventual elimination of strategic nuclear missiles.We urge the Conference on Disarmament to redouble its efforts to ensure the early conclusion of the convention banning the development  production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. The use of chemical weapons is already proscribed by the 1925 Geneva Protocol. However  it is our conviction that the mere possession of such weapons inevitably leads to their use. It is for that reason that we seek their total elimination.Outer space is the common heritage of mankind and must be used for practical purposes and for the benefit of all peoples. It should not become yet another frontier to be conquered in the armaments race  neither should it become another repository for implements of death and destruction. A weapon-free outer space is possible if all States forgo the so-called defensive option and commit themselves to the dialogue for general and complete disarmament. We call on the Conference on Disarmament to hasten negotiations aimed at the conclusion of agreements on the prevention of the extension of the arms race into outer space. Meanwhile  strict adherence by all parties to the already existing international legal instruments on space weapons  including the 1986 outer space Treaty and the 1972 anti-ballistic missile Treaty  would prevent the extension of the arms race Into outer space.In spite of the gains that have been made in a number of areas of disarmament  our world is far from being safe; the future of mankind is far from ensured. The prevention of nuclear war remains the most urgent task of our times and a pre-condition for all our endeavours. It Is Imperative that disarmament negotiations in the various multilateral forums be facilitated for the sake of the survival of mankind. It is for that reason that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries believes that the convening of a third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament could give the necessary political impetus to negotiations in various forums aimed at the elimination of the threat of nuclear weapons. We therefore urge the forty-second session of the General Assembly to decide on the specific dates for the convening of the special session. The convening of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development in August-September this year was an event of major significance. Viewed against the background of the seemingly unbridgeable differences and the dire prediction that the Conference was doomed to failure  the adoption of a consensus document after three weeks of serious negotiations was a victory for multilateralism. It was a testimony to the willingness of States to work peacefully together without intimidation or threats. This consensus may have fallen short of the expectations of many of us but we take comfort from the fact that a foundation-stone upon which we shall build has been laid. In a world in which global military expenditures now run at approximately $2 million a minute and threaten to burst the 31-tr ill ion-а-year barrier  the staggering opportunity-cost in terms of human needs not met  retarded and distorted economic growth or lost opportunities for constructive co-operation can no longer be ignored. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries looks forward to the consideration of this important item during this session of the General Assembly and the third special session devoted to disarmament.The gradual revival of multilateralism was evident not only during the recent Conference on disarmament and development but also at Geneva during the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The convening of UNCTAD VII against a background of uncertainty in the international economic environment and the adoption by consensus of the Final Act represents yet another victory for multilateralism.It has opened up new possibilities for progress in economic negotiations  particularly on the interrelated issues of money# finance  external debt and trade and development. The signature or ratification of the Commodity Fund Agreement by many more States during the UNCTAD meeting has brought the Common Fund for Commodities closer to fruition. The consensus reached in the areas of external debt and financial resource flows  though limited in scope  nevertheless opened new avenues that need further exploration during this session of the General Assembly. We in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  having participated actively in the evolution of the consensus at Geneva  stand ready to co-operate fully in exploring these new opportunities.Similarly  we hope to build on the consensus resolution  41/202  adopted at the forty-first session  which recognized that the external debt crisis had already reached dangerous proportions and that an integrated approach involving creditor and debtor nations  multilateral financial institutions and international private banks was necessary if durable solutions were to be found to the debt problem. We welcome the growing realization in some quarters in the industrialized creditor countries that the case-by-case approach cannot provide a viable solution to the debt crisis. We are concerned at suggestions that seem to indicate that the free play of blind market forces alone can correct the imbalances in the international system by a process of automatic adjustment.The long-term solution to the debt problem lies in the adoption of a comprehensive set of measures recognizing  inter alia  the need for growth in the debtor countries  for stability of commodity prices  for the halting of reverse transfer of resources from developing to developed countries and for the reinitiating of financial resource flows to developing countries with a view to achieving the official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product  as agreed in the International Development Strategy  and the official development assistance target of 1.5 per cent of gross national product for the least developed countries as agreed in the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s· We in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries believe that they are convening of an international conference on money and finance  with universal participation and aimed at meeting the development and financing requirements of the international economy  particularly those of the developing countries  is already long overdue. We therefore urge the forty-second session of the General Assembly to examine further the possibilities of setting in motion the preparatory process for the convening of such a conference without further delay.A little over a year ago the United Nations General Assembly  in recognition of the critical economic situation on the African continent  convened a special session for the purpose of mobilizing international support for Africa's efforts towards recovery and development. The partnership for development that emerged then between the international community and Africa under the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 held out hope of a promising future for Africa. Regrettably  that hope has been largely unfulfilled. The debt crisis  the collapse of commodity prices and stagnating resource flows to Africa continue to place obstacles on Africa's path to recovery. As if that were not enough  many of the commitments made by the international community have not been translated into concrete action in terms of increasing resource flows to Africa. It is therefore imperative that this session of the General Assembly explore new avenues for making available additional financial resources for Africa's development  in accordance with the commitments made during the special session  so as to avoid further deterioration of the situation in that part of the world. The non-aligned countries are determined to play their part through the enhancement of programmes for economic co-operation among developing countries. In June this year the members of the Movement had the opportunity to meet in Pyongyang  in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  in an Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting devoted solely to South-South co-operation. Action-oriented measures aimed at giving a new push to economic co-operation among developing countries were taken. We therefore call upon the United Nations to give all the necessary support  through its appropriate machinery  to these South-South programmes for co-operation.The interrelated nature of the issues of the environment and development is no longer a question for debate. We therefore welcome the findings in the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development  released earlier this year. We hope that the report will awaken the consciousness of the international community to the need for the mobilization of resources to enable developing countries to pursue long-term strategies harmonizing environmental considerations with developmental objectives.In addition to the challenges of disarmament and economic development  the international scene is still characterized by a number of focal points of tension. These crises distract the parties concerned from their priorities of socio-economic development and aggravate international tension. It is therefore essential that they be resolved  if international peace and security is to be assured. In this regard the signing of the Guatemala agreement by the five Central American Presidents in August this year is a most welcome development  promising a future of . hope and peace not only in Central America but also in the whole Latin American and ļ Caribbean region  and indeed for all mankind. In August this year I had the privilege of leading a nine-member delegation of the Standing Committee on Central America of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries; on a mission to Managua and Caracas. On that occasion we had the opportunity of meeting the Foreign Ministers of the countries of the Contadora and Support Groups  to deliver a message of support for the peace process in Central America from the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Wherever we went  whether Managua  Caracas or Panama  we were greeted by ordinary men and women whose only desire for their countries and their region was peace - peace to enable them to live with each other in harmony and friendship  peace to enable them to channel their energies into the socio-economic development of their countries  peace to give them a chance of hope for a brighter future for their little ones. Among those men and women in Nicaragua  Panama and Venezuela one could not fail to feel and sense an air of great expectation and hope and  above all  an overwhelming desire for peace. The people of Central America have dared to dream dreams which some of us are too cynical and too afraid even to think of.Central America would like to give peace a chance. Let us give the countries of that region an opportunity to give peace a chance. We have already heard some of the leaders of the subregion presenting their case before this international body from this rostrum. We shall be hearing others in the days to come. But what can this body do by way of response? How shall we respond to those eloquent appeals for peace? I believe that the international community should  first  unreservedly  openly and forcefully declare its support for the Guatemala agreement; secondly  solemnly call on all nations not to do anything that might undermine this very important agreement; thirdly  urge member countries to give increased financial support to Central America so that the subregion may address the economic and social problems resulting from years of economic disruption and neglect; and finally  give full support to the efforts of the Secretary-General in this regard and urge him to continue to fulfil his mandate to assist in every possible way in the implementation of the Guatemala agreement. Surely the minimum that we can do to demonstrate our support for this unique and daring regional Initiative is adopt a resolution embodying these elements.The deteriorating situation in the Middle East is a cause of great concern on the part of the international community. Earlier this year it seemed as though a consensus on the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East was at long last within our reach. Indeed  the Secretary-General's interim report (A/42/277  para. 6) noted encouraging signs of ""increased interest on the part of the international community in the idea of a [Middle East] conference"" and ""indications of greater flexibility on this issue amongst the parties"" directly concerned.It was in an effort further to promote the early convening of the international conference on peace in the Middle East that the Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries called for a special ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned Committee on Palestine  in Harare in April this year  to review international developments in the light Of General Assembly resolution 41/43 D of December 1986. A week later there was the historic Algiers meeting of the Palestinian National Council  which enhanced the unity of the Palestinian people  thus preparing them to be effective participants in the Middle East conference. Since that time the non-aligned countries have been engaged in consultations with the President of the Security Council  the Secretary-General and all the members of the Security Council in an effort to bring about the convening of the conference. We are still awaiting the Secretary-General's final report on the prospects for such a conference. In the meantime we appeal to the friends of the Tel Aviv regime to come out in the open in support of the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East. We urge them to make it clear to Israel that the international community cannot accept its continued veto of the convening of the Conference. We all know of course  that Israel does listen to its friends: for - as the French saying goes - c'est la vie and alas  the ""Lavi"" is no more. We urge the Security Council to meet as soon as the Secretary-General presents his final report so that it may take the necessary measures to bring about the convening of this important Conference.The return of peace and stability to the troubled Gulf region must receive our undivided attention. In this connection  we welcome the Secretary-General’s efforts to restore peace in that part of the world. We urge Iran and Iraq to heed the call of the international community to put an immediate end to this fratricidal war  which should not have been. But  equally  we are opposed to the introduction of forces alien to the region  as these can only aggravate the tension there. We therefore call for the removal of such alien forces from the Gulf.The situation in southern Africa continues to threaten international peace and security. The past year has proved  for all to see  that the Pretoria regime has no intention of dismantling the immoral system of apartheid. Quite to the contrary: the racist regime has intensified its campaign of terror against the oppressed masses of South Africa in defence of its heinous system. The situation has deteriorated badly  as can be seen from the re-imposition of a state of emergency; the muzzling of the press; the radical lurch to the right in white politics; and the systematic and unrelenting campaign of torture  assassination and detention and arrests of children  women  workers and opponents of apartheid. An age of darkness has descended upon that benighted country. It is clear that Pretoria has lost respect for or feat of a divided international community  it has taken comfort in the complicity of those countries which have used their vetoes in the Security Council to shield it from the wrath of the international community. It is necessary that Pretoria be left in no doubt that it is a pariah because of its obnoxious policies. But what can be done now to get our message across? it is my humble suggestion that we need to follow a two-track strategy. The first should be to examine the possibility of the setting up of an international mechanism to monitor and report on the implementation of the various packages of sanctions already agreed to by the international community. That will introduce an element of heightened accountability. Secondly  we should demand that the United States  the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany desist forthwith from shielding South Africa in the Security Council  and we should call upon the Security Council to impose immediate comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa.The international community has a special responsibility to bring Namibia to independence. The time has long passed for it to discharge that duty. In August this year the apartheid regime unleashed a vicious campaign of terror in the Territory. It has flooded the Territory with over 100 000 armed troops to terrorize the tiny population of Namibia. Arrests  disappearances  detention without trial  murder and assassination have become the regime's methods to coerce the population into submission. Churches and schools have been demolished  often fire-bombed  at the slightest suspicion that their followers are sympathetic to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Trade unions and other popular movements are under siege. Namibia today is the definition of hell on earth for its inhabitants.	 The international community has an obligation to respond  and to do so urgently and decisively. Namibia is not free because Pretoria continues to occupy it illegally in order to protect apartheid in South Africa. Namibia's independence is delayed because the United States has linked the achievement of independence by Namibia to the removal of Cuban troops from Angola. Namibia's independence is therefore now a hostage to the interests of the United States. The responsibility of all of us is to try to convince the United States that blackmail and hostage-taking are wrong  no matter the victim or the perpetrator. We should consider taking a series of direct steps to fulfil our obligations to the people of Namibia. First  we should expose and condemn the reign of terror in Namibia both through the media and by appropriate action in the General Assembly and the Security Council  as need be. Secondly  we should now trigger the process of implementing resolution 435 (1978) through the Security Council. And finally  should that fail  we should consider other  alternative approaches within the provisions of the Charter - and there are many - to bring Namibia to independence.The front-line States and States neighbouring Pretoria have suffered much of late as a result of Pretoria's increased destabilization activities. We therefore call on the international community to render increased material assistance to those States  in order to help them to resist Pretoria's aggression. In this connection  we appeal for increased support for the AFRICA Fund (Action for Resisting Innovation  Colonialism and Apartheid Fund)   established by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at Harare last year for the purpose of assisting those States’ Focal points of tension are  unfortunately  found in many other parts of the world. The independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus need our full support. That beautiful island and its warm and wonderful people can never know peace while foreign troops are on the island and continue to increase in number. The present stalemate is fraught with danger. It is important for the international community to examine  if need be in a more formal setting  what further actions it could take to bring peace to Cyprus.We are likewise concerned that the aspirations of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their country remain unfulfilled. It is our belief that this objective can best be realized through dialogue and consultations between North and South  without any foreign interference  and in conformity with the three principles of independence  peaceful reunification and great national unity set forth in the North-South Joint Statement of 4 July 1972. For this purpose  it is essential that all foreign troops be withdrawn from the area.The situations prevailing in Afghanistan and Kampuchea are sources of serious concern to the international community. With regard to these conflicts  we stress the importance of the principles of non-interference and non-intervention in the affairs of sovereign States and the inadmissibility of the use of force against sovereign States. The people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea have the right to determine their own destiny  free from foreign interference or coercion. There can be no justification  in any circumstances whatsoever  for foreign interference or intervention in the internal affairs of these or any other States. These are sacred principles on which the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries can never compromise. We commend the Secretary-General's efforts to find a peaceful settlement of these conflicts  and call upon all concerned to co-operate with biro in this regard.The right of all peoples to self-determination and independence is a sacred tenet of our Organization  enshrined in resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960. When we look at the 159 members of our body and recall that the overwhelming majority of them were formerly colonies  we can be justifiably proud of our record. This success should not  however  distract us from the imperative need to complete the task we set for ourselves through the resolution. The broad surge towards freedom and independence  which began before 1960 and carried on through the 1970s  seems to have ebbed  and we appear to be at a stage at which the forces of resurgent colonialism and imperialism are gathering strength and retrenching themselves to oppose humanity's impulse towards freedom. The cases of Namibia  Sahraoui  New Caledonia  Puerto Rico  Micronesia and other dependent Territories are a constant reminder that our battle for the self-determination and national independence of peoples is still unfinished. We demand the immediate implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant United Nations resolutions in all these cases.The importance of the United Nations can hardly be overemphasized. It is the one truly universal body representing the free association of States on the basis of sovereign equality and reflecting the hopes and aspirations of all peoples all over the world. We cannot therefore accept the undermining of its role. By circumventing it  by blocking its capacity to function and  recently  by trying to manipulate it through the withholding of funds  certain States have sought to erode the authority of the United Nations. If there is waste in the running of the Organization  we would be glad to see it corrected and the resultant savings put to better use. If the United Nations can be run more efficiently  all the better. But what we will not countenance are attempts to hijack the Organization and subvert its democratic character through the withholding of assessed contributions - itself a delinquent act and a violation of obligations under the Charter.This is our Organization. As a universal Organization  it must hearken to a kaleidoscopic constituency. Misguided attempts to make it monochromatic and serve special Interests can only detract from its noble goals and eventually lead to its demise. For the United Nations addresses a complex reality  and that reality win not become simpler merely through pretence that it is so.A very real tragedy that has befallen our Organization is the view of certain States that they can reduce it to a mere rubber-stamp for their individual policies through the buying of votes. Some have even pursued the strategy of keeping registers of those who vote ""with them"" or ""against them"" in this forum  with the object of using that information as a yardstick by which to judge to whom they shall give or refuse aid. We deprecate this debasement of the United Nations through attempts to turn it into an auction floor where votes go to the highest bidder. We are here  not to vote for or against any country  but to take decisions on issues - based on principles  for that matter. Therefore  if judge we must : then let us judge each other by the degree of faithfulness to the principles of the Charter. If a register be kept  then by all means let it be kept right here at the United Nations  controlled by non-governmental people  comprising the best legal  political and social scientists of the day. Let them judge each one of us; according to how often the votes we cast are in accordance with  and seek to uphold  the principles of the Charter. Yes  let us get stars and incentives for our loyalty to the Charter  the instrument by which we have bound ourselves. This Organization can never be ""our"" United Nations as opposed to ""theirs""; nor can it be ""theirs"" as opposed to ""ours"". Once we see it as ""ours"" f it will not serve ""them""  nor will it really serve ""us"". As ""theirs""  it will not serve ""us"" or ""them"". Only as the United Nations  meeting everybody's views in part and forcing compromise from all  will it serve anyone at all."
