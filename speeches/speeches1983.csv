"1",13,"AFG",38,1983,"ï»¿66.	 May I  at the outset  Sir  express to you the sincere felicitations of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and my own congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We feel certain that  experienced diplomat of high calibre that you undoubtedly are  your very able and efficient guidance of the present session will ensure its success. I wish to assure you of the full co-operation of my delegation in carrying out your responsibilities.67.	I should also like to pay a warm tribute to Mr. Imre Hollai  President of the thirty-seventh session  for the excellent and exemplary manner in which he conducted the work of that session.68.	Our appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General for his untiring endeavours to enhance the effectiveness and moral prestige of the Organization.69.	The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  like any other nation of the world  has a high stake in preserving the United Nations as a universal instrument for maintaining peace and security and promoting friendship  co-operation and detente among nations.70.	Another year of turbulence  insecurity and innumerable political  social and economic problems is added to the history of our world. No doubt it was the wish of the entire membership that we would be able to report on the achievement of those goals which we ourselves set in the Charter of the United Nations as of primary significance to all of us.71.	Separate and isolated examples notwithstanding  not only did the problems of a global nature  to our disappointment  maintain their grim character  but some of those international problems acquired a sharp turn for the worse.72.	The threat of a nuclear war has never been more imminent than it seems to be in the present state of international relations. Not only has the psychological and material drive towards such a catastrophe continued unabated  but the pace of the nuclear arms race  as well as the conventional arms spree  reached unprecedented levels.73.	The horrendous doctrines of security through force  negotiating from strength  limited or protracted nuclear war  have been the predominant shadows hanging over the life of our planet during the last year. The threat to the very survival of the human race is ever more evident  particularly in the light of the present United States Administration's policy of rearmament and all-out confrontation.74.	The powerful cry of the masses throughout the world for an immediate halt to the arms race and for disarmament  particularly in its nuclear aspect  has gone unheard. The numerous resolutions of the General Assembly to that end have been irresponsibly shelved by those in United States warmongering circles. In total disregard of the demands and against the interests of the overwhelming majority of nations  which found reflection in those resolutions  the United States Congress hastened to approve one bill after another allocating billions of dollars for the production of such monstrous and horrifying weapons of mass destruction as MX  Pershing II and cruise missiles  so-called binary chemical weapons  Trident submarines  B-l strategic bombers  and so on. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  as a member of the family of nations which would inevitably become innocent victims of a nuclear world war  cannot but vehemently condemn the militaristic course adopted by the United States Administration and Congress.75.	It is with that consideration in mind that we follow with great concern the developments resulting from the United States plans to deploy hundreds of Pershing II and cruise missiles on the European continent  where disproportionately large destructive potential has already accumulated. If that United States aggressive design to gain military superiority over the Soviet Union in Europe and elsewhere is carried out as planned  we are certain that another spiralling arms race will become all the more probable  thus threatening more than ever before the existence of mankind.76.	Therefore  it is the first and foremost task of the international community to avert the danger of a thermonuclear holocaust.77.	The constructive and realistic proposals of the Soviet Union on the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe  its unilateral declaration that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons and the recent proposals put forward by Yuri Andropov have received the overwhelming support of the international community. We reaffirm our full support for those initiatives and for the proposal of the States parties  to the Warsaw Treaty that a treaty on the mutual non M   of military force and the maintenance of relations of peace be concluded between them and the member States of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. We support the proposals recently put forward by the Soviet Union in the letters of Andrei Gromyko to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and associate ourselves with the request that they be included in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly.78.	Questions relating to the world economy  to international economic relations and to development are directly related to those of peace and stability. The outlook for world economic development and co-operation depends on the success of peace-loving forces in achieving the principal purpose of the Charter of the United Nations  which is to save succeeding generations from the scourge and horrors of war and to preserve and strengthen peace. It is a fact that the enormous resources being squandered on the unproductive arms race could very usefully be allocated to development activities and international economic co-operation.79.	This session of the General Assembly is held against the background of extremely difficult and severe international economic conditions. The prolonged crisis in the world capitalist system has adversely affected the national economies of the developing countries and international economic relations as a whole.80.	The gap between the levels of economic development in the developed and the developing countries is widening  and it is becoming more difficult to carry out the tasks and reach the targets of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. The process of restructuring international economic relations and the implementation of the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order have been drastically slowed down and even halted. I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to the alarming situation and economic crisis being faced by the least developed countries  particularly those in a more disadvantageous situation because of their geographic location as land-locked countries. The painfully slow pace at which the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries' is being implemented is especially disappointing. We urge the international community to implement fully and effectively the Substantial New Programme of Action and provide financial assistance to the least developed countries in amounts and on terms which correspond to their immediate and long-term development needs.81.	The enormous burden of economic problems weighing on the vast majority of nations has become all the heavier as a result of the increased use of the international financial system as a means of pressure and intimidation to promote the selfish political and economic interests of the world's capitalist masters.82.	Hotbeds of tension and trouble spots throughout the world have been further inflamed by a higher profile of imperialist military presence  particularly that of United States imperialism  that tends to internationalize some internal  bilateral or regional problems. There is hardly any place in the world where the ominous presence of the imperialist interventionist forces has not resulted in the escalation of the threat to the security and stability of the countries in those regions. 83.	In the Indian Ocean the United States naval presence has increased many times over the past few years  and the nations of the region still await the realization of their long-cherished aspiration to turn it into a zone of peace.84.	Acting in stark contrast to the desires of the surrounding nations  which want to see the Indian Ocean and the adjacent areas free from foreign military bases and installations  the United States has drastically increased its military build-up on the Mauritian island of Diego Garcia. It was in conformity with its expansionist policy that the United States and its allies torpedoed the holding of the Conference on the Indian Ocean  which- the non-aligned members of the 4(7 Committee on the Indian Ocean had proposed should be held last May at Colombo.85.	The call of the President of Madagascar  Mr. Ratsiraka  for a summit conference of hinterland and littoral States of the Indian Ocean  which initiative is fully supported by my Government  also encounters obstacles put up by those in imperialist quarters.86.	We expect this session of the General Assembly to call for the expeditious conclusion of the preparatory work and for the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean not later than 1984.87.	The cold and negative response of some countries to such an important initiative as the proposal by the Mongolian People's Republic for a convention on mutual non-aggression and non-use of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific has put off the achievement of overall peace and stability in those regions.88.	Despite the obvious failure of imperialistic and hegemonistic designs against the People's Republic of Kampuchea  those countries have yet to submit to realities that are not to their liking. It is high time for the international community to restore to the people of Kampuchea their legitimate right to be represented in the Assembly. Numerous proposals by the three countries of Indo-China  and especially the recent proposal advanced by the summit conference of those countries aimed at normalization of the situation in the region of South-East Asia have opened up promising prospects for the cessation of regional hostilities.89.	In the Middle East  the course of events has been anything but encouraging. Palestinian and other Arab territories  including Jerusalem and Syria's Golan Heights  remain under the heels of Israeli occupation forces. The denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  which constitutes the core of the problem  together with the Zionist ambitions for & Greater Israel  have turned the whole region into a permanent threat to the security of the entire world. It is our belief that Israel's arrogant defiance of international norms and principles would long since have submitted to the moral pressure of world public opinion had United States imperialism denied Israel the political  financial and military means that it so generously extends to the Zionist war machine.90.	Since last year the situation in Lebanon has continued to be fraught with the danger of provoking another all-out war in the Middle East. The replacement of Israeli forces in Beirut by the contingents of NATO countries and their brazen intervention in the internal hostilities have added seriously to the concern that the conflict in Lebanon may quickly become internationalized. We condemn the barbaric shelling of the Lebanese towns and villages by United States naval forces.91.	The events of the past few years have delivered a rebuff to all attempts to isolate the integral componentsof the Middle East crisis by prescribing separate deals and collusive agreements for their solution.92.	The cessation of the Israeli aggression against Arab countries  the immediate and complete evacuation of Israeli forces from the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories and the exercise by the Palestinian people  under the leadership of their sole and legitimate representative the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  of their right to self-determination are thus the prerequisites for achieving the long-overdue comprehensive settlement.93.	The International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983  has given us the most recent evaluation by the international community of this unfortunate problem that has been weighing on its conscience for almost three and a half decades. There it was reaffirmed once again that there could be no lasting  comprehensive and just solution of the problem of the Middle East unless the people of Palestine effectively exercised their inalienable rights  including the right to establish their own national State in Palestine. In conformity with paragraph 6 of the Geneva Declaration on Palestine  we call on the Security Council to create appropriate institutional arrangements for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East.94.	Here we should like to reiterate our firm support for the valiant Palestinian  Syrian and Lebanese patriots in their heroic struggle against imperialist and Zionist aggression and occupation.95.	The southern part of Africa remains a constant target of the Pretoria regime's policy of racist repression within South Africa  occupation and suppression in Namibia and aggression and acts of intimidation against independent African countries of the region.96.	The period under review has not failed to produce much new evidence of apartheid regime's intransigence with regard to the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia; nor has it been without new examples of Pretoria's destabilizing and aggressive designs against Angola  Mozambique  Lesotho and other neighbouring countries. The brutal murder by theregime of several South African freedom fighters  in complete disregard of the repeated demands for clemency  proved once again that the regime in South Africa has no intention whatsoever  despite what is said in certain capitals  of introducing any meaningful change in its criminal and abhorrent system.97.	The heavy reliance of the Pretoria regime on the support it receives from capitalist countries  particularly from United States imperialism  has enabled it to block any solution to the overriding problems for which that regime is responsible. We pledge our total support to the front-line States  to the heroic people of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and to the oppressed people of South Africa and their vanguard  the African National Congress.98.	We stand by our Libyan brothers in the face of repeated open violation of their sovereignty and independence by the United States  and we call for an immediate end to such threats.99.	The situation in Central America has become a source of increasing concern  not only for the people of the region  but for the entire international community as well. That the main cause of tension and hostility in the area lies in the interventionist and aggressive policy of the United States is beyond question. 100.	Plots and machinations aimed at Nicaragua through the organizing  training and arming of the Somozist counterrevolutionaries and their dispatch into that country from neighbouring countries to commit acts of subversion and sabotage and to undermine the revolution have continued to increase. The piratic air attack on the city of Managua demonstrated the brazen nature of the escalating aggression against Nicaragua.101.	During the course of the past year the imperialist blockade of the revolutionary peoples of Cuba  Grenada and Suriname has tightened  while resort to the use of economic assistance as a means to bring pressure to bear against a number of other Latin American countries has become an increasingly important part of the United States design to challenge the free will of the people of the continent.102.	We demand the early return to Cuba of its territory illegally occupied by the United States naval base at Guantanamo.We reiterate our support for the initiative of the States members of the Contadora Group in finding an amicable and peaceful solution to the present situation in Central America. Our solidarity is always with national liberation movements  including those of El Salvador  Chile and Guatemala.106.	We would like to express our disappointment at the failure of the many different endeavours by the international community to bring about the cessation of hostilities between the two neighbouring Islamic countries of Iran and Iraq. Continuation of that senseless bloodshed  which has already led to enormous material and human losses  can only serve the interests of imperialism by providing it with a pretext for military intervention in the region. It is our earnest hope that an end can be put to this fratricidal war as soon as possible.107.	Our position on the question of Cyprus remains unchanged. We express our full support for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non- aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. We demand the withdrawal of occupation forces from that country.108.	We reaffirm our support for the peaceful reunification of Korea on the basis of the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.109.	The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  as a staunch fighter in the cause of decolonization  is in favour of the speedy exercise by the people of Puerto Rico of their right to self-determination and independence  of restitution of the Malvinas Islands to the Argentine Republic  of recognition of the right of the people of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic to self-determination and of the return of the Malagasy Islands of Glorieuses  Juan de Nova  Europe and Bassas da India to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar.110.	We had hoped that the period since the last session of the General Assembly might witness a decrease in the tension in the region of South-West Asia that could pave the way for the creation of an atmosphere of trust and confidence conducive to negotiations among Afghanistan and two of its neighbours. The unfortunate reality of the continuing undeclared imperialist war of reaction being waged against my people  principally Rom the territory of Pakistan  constitutes the stumbling block to the conclusion of an agreement on the basis of which the future relationships of our countries will be founded.111.	This unholy war  which is in fact a regional extension of the global imperialist plot to destabilize and subdue independent and sovereign nations and to force them into the imperialist orbit  is masterminded by aggressive circles in the United States and carried out with the hegemonistic and other reactionary countries and forces of the region as accomplices. The destructive inhuman  medieval and uncivilized nature of that undeclared war indicates the true outlines of the self-proclaimed posture of humanism  morality and freedom adopted by United States imperialism and Chinese hegemonism and their reactionary allies.112.	The losses suffered by our people since the beginning of the undeclared war against our revolution are of enormous proportions. As a result of the subversive activities of the counter-revolutionary gangs  exported mainly from Pakistan  half of all schools in the country  50 per cent of our hospitals  14 per cent of public-transport motor vehicles  75 per cent of all communication lines  a number of hydroelectric and thermal power installations of the country  and other public facilities have been destroyed. The total cost to our economy comes to some 24 billion Afghanis  which amounts to half the total development investment made in the 20 years prior to the 27 April 1978 revolution.113.	Let me declare before this gathering that the heroic Afghan people will not be deterred from the principled path they have chosen. They are prepared to make further sacrifices to safeguard their revolution and their socio-political system.114.	Thanks to the determination of our toiling people  to the carefully planned economic policy of the revolutionary Government and to the all-around assistance received from fraternal countries  especially the Soviet Union  our national economy has been steadily stabilized and has already embarked on the path of consistent growth. In light of the present pace of implementation of the five-year socio-economic development plan  we look forward to exceeding the targets set by that plan.115.	The devotion of our revolutionary armed forces  the active participation of the masses in the defense of the evolution  the surrender en masse of the counterrevolutionary gangs to the security forces and their subsequent organization into committees for the defence of the revolution have  all in all  contributed to the continued process of normalization throughout the country and to the strengthening of the local organs of State power.116.	I should like to put on record my Government's sincere appreciation of the efforts of the Secretary- General of the United Nations and his representative to normalize the situation around Afghanistan. Despite the complexity of the issues involved  and in view of the present format of negotiations  tangible progress has been made in the course of the negotiating process being carried out at Geneva between Afghanistan and Pakistan through the intermediary of Mr. Diego Cordovez  the representative of the Secretary-General.117.	As is obvious  armed interference aimed at the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan from the territory of Pakistan is the root cause of the problem around Afghanistan. It is therefore the cessation of that interference which should constitute the main purpose of the negotiations. With the solution of this aspect of the problem  and after reliable international guarantees on the non-resumption of interference have been secured  conditions would prevail which would facilitate the return of the Afghans temporarily living beyond our frontiers. This is clearly envisaged in our proposals of 15 May 1980 and 24 August 1981.118.	We are certain that with a sense of realism  political will and sincerity it should be possible to achieve through direct negotiations a final agreement which  if faithfully implemented  would serve the cause of stability and peace in the region.119.	Afghanistan pursues an independent  peaceful and active non-aligned policy. We are determined to follow that course in the future  in conformity with the aspirations of our people regarding their potential. This position is also based on our overall analysis of the increasingly crucial role being played by the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries in international relations. We are committed to the decisions of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983 under the very able guidance of the Prime Minister of India  Mrs. India Gandhi. We shall spare no effort  individually and in co-operation with others  in order to give effect to the decisions of that Conference  in conformity with the principles and objectives of the Movement.120.	I should like to conclude with some words of Babrak Karmal  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and President of the Revolutionary Council of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  who said that peaceful relations with all countries and peoples of the world  including our neighbours  on the basis of internationally recognized principles of peaceful coexistence  non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  respect for sovereignty  territorial integrity and national independence  friendship and co-operation remain the prime objectives of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.

"2",52,"AGO",38,1983,"ï»¿149 .  It is a particular pleasure for me to express to you  Sir  on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola  our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a high tribute to your country  Panama  but it is also a reflection of your acknowledged remarkable diplomatic skill. We wish you the greatest success in carrying out your great responsibilities.150.	Allow us to take this opportunity to convey to Mr. Imre Hollai our great appreciation for the far-sighted and dignified way in which he carried out his mandate from the very beginning of the thirty-seventh session.151.	We should like also to reiterate our keen appreciation of the devotion of the Secretary-General to the fundamental principles of the United Nations and of his important contribution to the search for just solutions commensurate with the serious problems confronting the international community.152.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Angola would like at this point to congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission to membership of the United Nations.153.	Each year  when a new session of the General Assembly is convened  we all come here to reaffirm our commitment to the noble purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to reiterate our devotion to the cause of freedom  peace  justice  democracy  solidarity  development and co-operation.154.	At the beginning of their statements  the speakers âalmost invariablyâstress that the General Assembly session is taking place at a very critical moment  for the international situation has badly deteriorated  to the point of seriously threatening the survival of mankind.155.	But it is undeniable that there is an ever-widening gap between fine words or good intentions and action. All of us merely repeat ourselves annually  thus putting to the test the tolerance  or resistance  of our auditors and the credibility of those who speak before this Assembly.156.	On several occasions  from this very rostrum  we have made no secret of the deep concern of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola over the impotence or resignation of competent international bodies or their abdication of their responsibility to face up to the proliferation of hotbeds of tension  which are kindled  directly or indirectly  by the imperialist Powers.157.	No one here can be unaware of the causes of and the agents responsible for this grim international picture. We repeat the question: how long will the peoples and Governments that cherish peace and justice have to wait before the existing United Nations bodiesâwhich are adequate to the taskâtruly shoulder their responsibilities and firmly take the most effective measures  which they do indeed have at their disposal  against those who violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations; against those who carry on colonial wars and foment all sorts of acts of aggression  direct or indirect  the victims being States that take independent  progressive positions; against those who engage in the economic plunder of underdeveloped countries and who persist in preventing the gradual reduction of the gap which exists between the rich or developed countries and the poor or underdeveloped countries; against those who deliberately hinder the serious efforts of the socialist countries and the progressive  democratic forces to achieve detente  general and complete disarmament  and a comprehensive prohibition of the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction  in particular nuclear weapons; against those who stimulate the arms race  thus ensuring fabulous profits for their military industries and leading to faster increases in military budgets and expenditures; against those who engage in an ever-increasing number of gigantic military manoeuvres which are intended to intimidate certain peoples or States  or even to carry out acts of aggression against them; against those who do not respect relevant resolutions or decisions of the General Assembly  the Security Council  the Non-Aligned Movement and the OAU; against those who undermine the authority of the Secretary-General and his efforts to carry out his great responsibilities by failing to provide him with all the means of which he has need; and against those who threaten international peace and security through military intervention and illegal occupation of territories  through interference in the internal affairs of other States and through a lack of respect for the principles of non-use of force and the settlement of disputes by means of negotiations?158.	All these things  but especially the unbridled arms race and the threat of a nuclear war  involve huge expenditures  thus accelerating inflation  causing large budget deficits and further reducing the already decreasing volume of economic assistance to the underdeveloped countries. This has greatly contributed to the present economic crisis  which can be solved only by taking effective measures to establish the new international economic order advocated several years ago by the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries.159.	Given this alarming situation  which clearly threatens the future of the peoples  and given the growing tragedy of the millions of human beings still deprived of their freedom and the right to choose their own destiny and without any means of resisting servitude  humiliation  tyranny  poverty  famine  ignorance and disease  it is imperative that at this session the General Assembly dedicate itself to the search for effective solutions to the problems afflicting mankind.160.	We feel that the situation in southern Africa deserves the very special attention of this session of the General Assembly  in that we are witnessing a dangerous escalation of aggression by the racist  fascist Pretoria regime against the front-line countries  and especially against the People's Republic of Angola.161.	The persistent efforts of the apartheid regime to increase its military potential and even to acquire an arsenal of nuclear weapons is one further proof of its sinister projects  which are designed to perpetuate colonialism in South Africa and deprive the overwhelming majority of the South African people of their freedom and their political  economic and social rights  so as to keep them subjected to the white minority; to maintain the illegal occupation of Namibia and to destabilize the front-line countries  employing for that purpose armed puppets. The complicity of certain Western countries and Israel with the South African regime in these areas  as well as the investments and economic assistance with which those countries provide South Africa  cannot help but encourage the Pretoria regime in its stubbornness and in its role of the policeman of imperialism.162.	Everybody here knows that South African aggression against the People's Republic of Angola goes back to August 1975. Everybody knows too that South African troops invaded Angola several weeks before the proclamation of independence  which was scheduled for 11 November 1975. Everybody knows also that the racist and fascist Pretoria regime  encouraged by the militarist  warlike policy of the present United States Administration  put into operation a mysterious plan entitled  Operation Proteus   which resulted in a new invasion and the occupation since 23 August 1981 of a considerable area of the province of Cunene.163.	To this day  reconnaissance flights  aerial bombardments  helicopter troop operations  land bombardments and attacks  mining operations and acts of sabotage against the Angolan economic infrastructure are gradually increasing. A certain number of villages are today either in ruins or are mere remnants of what they were in the past.164.	The disturbing dimension of the escalation of South African acts of aggression has become even more clear through the attack on the village of Cangamba in the province of Moxico  500 kilometres from the frontier with Namibia. Between 2 and 8 August  six battalions  made up of UNIT A   bands of South African commandos and of mercenaries  supported by heavy artillery  carried out several attacks against Cangamba  which is an important crossroads. None the less  the heroic resistance of our armed forces inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy forces  who left behind 1 100 dead and much South African and NATO equipment.165.	Following this defeat the Pretoria regime launched an air attack against the village of Cangamba  using a squadron of Mirage fighters and Canberra bombers  and completely destroyed the village.166.	Faced with the escalation of the acts of aggression by the racist and fascist Pretoria regime against the People's Republic of Angola  the Angolan Government has alerted the competent international bodies to the seriousness of the situation and the unpredictable consequences. It is becoming clear to the Angolan Government that such acts of aggression constitute an integral part of collusion or a plot between certain Western Powers and the South African regime  closely associated with the puppet UNIT A bandits  aimed at the destabilization of the Angolan revolutionary process and the overthrow of the legitimate Government of the People's Republic of Angola. This would lead to the establishment of a neo- colonial regime in Angola  the annihilation of SWAPO and  consequently  the inevitable destruction of the Namibian independence process.167.	Those plans are thus both serious and dangerous  and all this is largely due to the fact that the Angolan people  their Party and their Government have shown firm and unconditional solidarity with SWAPO and ANC in their struggle for national independence.168.	It is appropriate to recall here that the General Assembly  in its resolution 36/121 A of 10 December 1981  declared that  the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa continues to constitute an act of aggression against the Namibian people and against the United Nations  which has direct responsibility for the Territory until independence . We should also recall that theSeventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in its Political Declaration strongly condemned the continued military ( pupation of part of Angolan territory by the South African racist troops in violation of the national sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola. The Conference considered the occupation of Angolan territory as an act of aggression against the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from Angolan territory and decided to increase support for and solidarity with the people and Government of Angola in order to consolidate Angola's national independence  and safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. To the extent that these two international bodies consider aggression to have been committed against them by South Africa  an adequate retort is called for. None the less  and in all honesty  it must be agreed that in spite of the legitimacy  the firmness and the scope of such positions  they have remained a dead letter as far as the overwhelming majority of the Members of the United Nations are concerned.169.	And so it seems to us unjust and a bitter irony that because of the selfish interests of some and the passivity or unjustified indifference of others  the heroic Angolan people are being left almost alone to bear the high cost of solidarity with the Namibian people  reflected in the loss of more than 10 000 lives  thousands of mutilated and handicapped  and hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes. It is also reflected in $10 billion in material damages caused by the criminal aggressions carried out by the racist and Fascist Pretoria regime since 1975.170.	None the less  the Angolan Government ventures once again to express the hope at this critical time for the People's Republic of Angola that each Member State of the United Nations will assume its responsibilities and meet its commitments  if only to maintain the credibility of this international body. Therefore  we appeal to each Member of the Organization to lend  as an emergency measure  either individually or collectively  all the material and financial assistance the People's Republic of Angola needs. We also request an intensive and permanent national and international campaign for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from Angolan territory. We would also ask for all forms of pressure to be exerted on the Pretoria regime as well as on its  friends and allies   including mandatory global sanctions  which have often been recommended but never enforced due to the opposition  of the Western Powers  so that its illegal occupation of Namibia may be ended. We also request that resolution 435 (1978) of the Security Council be enforced without further delay.171.	Five years have elapsed since the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978). In its resolution 532 (1983)  the Council decided  to mandate the Secretary- General to undertake consultations with the parties to the proposed cease-fire  with a view to securing the speedy implementation of [Security Council] resolution 435 (1978) .172.	In discharging his mandate  the Secretary-General made known to all of us his further report concerning the implementation of Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 439 (1978) concerning the question of Namibia  which will certainly be submitted to the Security Council for its assessment in a meeting to be held shortly. 173.	However  is it not surprising and perhaps significant that during this session of the General Assembly only one of the members of the so-called contact group- Canadaâ-has taken a stand on the Namibian question  especially when this was the subject of a detailed report by the Secretary-General? In this context  we take the liberty of making known to all Members an excerpt from an important statement made by President Jos6 Eduardo dos Santos  during a public meeting on the occasion of the arrival in Angola of the Secretary-General  in which he firmly reiterated  without any ambiguity whatsoever  the official position of MP LA   the party of the workers and of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola: We do not agree with the idea that there should be a demand for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. They are there because their presence was requested by the sovereign Government of Angola. What is needed is a demand for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the racist South African troops occupying part of our territory in the south of Angola. All those who seek to establish a link or parallelism between the independence of Namibia and the presence of Cuban forces in Angola are not our friends. They are our enemies  because they want to allow the South African troops  which are already occupying part of our territory  to march on towards Luanda and to do so without meeting the slightest resistance. We are prepared to continue to fight and to continue to undertake diplomatic actions for a just solution to the problems in southern Africa. And once again  I reaffirm here the position of our vanguard party and of our Government: The first requirement is the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops occupying this territory; secondly  resolution 435 (1978) of the Security Council must be speedily implemented in order to steer Namibia to real independence; thirdly  South Africa's attacks on Angola must cease; fourthly  all logistical and military support given to the gangs of UNITA puppets terrorizing our towns must cease. Only if these conditions are observed will Angola be prepared to discuss with Cuba the new timetable for the gradual withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola which are guaranteeing its security. In this connection  it should be emphasized that this is the official position. Therefore  there is no other position  as claimed by some.174.	We should now like to restate the position of the People's Republic of Angola on a certain number of specific political issues which are continuing to disturb international relations and to threaten world peace and security.175.	The people of Chad are today embroiled in a bloody fratricidal war. Chad must be spared from foreign intervention so that the people can decide without constraint or hindrance how best to solve their problem in keeping with the efforts of the OAU.176.	The solution to the conflict between POLISARIO   and the Kingdom of Morocco resides in the implementation of the resolution on the Western Sahara adopted at the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity. It is regrettable that the Kingdom of Morocco refuse   to follow the path of direct negotiation. It thus shows   n- tempt for the sovereign decision of the Heads of State and Government of Africa. It is thus responsible for the failure of the meetings of the Implementation Committee and for the consequences of the worsening of the conflict. We reiterate our militant solidarity with the heroic Saharan people and its sole and legitimate representative  POLISARIO.177.	We reaffirm our steadfast solidarity with the valiant Palestinian people and its legitimate representative  the PLO  in the continuation of its struggle to recover its usurped land and to establish an independent State. Furthermore  we reiterate our support for the Declaration and the Programme of Action adopted by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983. Once again we call for the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem  and we commend the efforts of the Lebanese people to secure their unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity.178.	After eight years of armed struggle  the people of East Timor is still continuing with determination and courage its resistance to Indonesian occupation. Given the defeats inflicted on its army as a result of the scope of the political and military action of the FRETILIN fighters  the Indonesian Government was forced to seek a meeting with the leaders of FRETILIN. That meeting took place from 20 to 23 March 1983  in the free territory of East Timor. During those talks a cease-fire was arranged in order to create a climate favourable for formal negotiations  which were to be held subsequently under the auspices of the Secretary-General and with the participation of representatives of Portugal  the former administering Power.179.	On that occasion  the delegation of FRETILIN presented to the Indonesian delegation the following conditions: first  the unconditional withdrawal of Indonesian occupation forces from East Timor; secondly  the presence of a United Nations multinational force to replace Indonesian troops during the period of transition; thirdly  the forces of FRETILIN to remain in the regions which they controlled in order to keep the people free from any pressure; fourthly  a referendum supervised by the United Nations in order to determine the wishes of the people of East Timor.180.	Unfortunately  it must be noted that the Indonesian Government did not respect its undertakings following the cease-fire  because it did not wish to inform the Secretary-General of the results of the talks. Instead it chose to try to go back on those talks and to reduce them to an offer of amnesty to FRETILIN. Furthermore  starting on 17 August  it launched a major military offensive in order to try to crush the heroic resistance of the people of East Timor.181.	It is difficult to imagine that a certain number of States members of the Non-Aligned Movement  States that should be identified with the struggle of that valiant people if only out of respect for the fundamental principles of non-alignment  are in fact remaining indifferent to the genocide which is being carried out against the people of East Timor. And the United Nations cannot shirk its responsibilities with respect to that serious problem. Our solidarity is a vital duty.182.	The central region of Latin America has experienced extremely disturbing developments as a result of threats and military intervention by the United States Government  particularly in Nicaragua and El Salvador. It is necessary to seek peace in the region through a negotiated political solution. To that end  we support the six-point position of the Government of Nicaragua as well as the efforts of the Contadora Group. In order to have peace in Central America  there must be peace in El Salvador and aggression against Nicaragua and EI Salvador must end. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and the Revolutionary Democratic Front  the sole  legitimate representatives of the Salvadoran people.183.	We renew our steadfast support for the Cuban revolution and we denounce acts of aggression and threats perpetrated against the Cuban people. We reiterate our feelings of solidarity with the peoples of Panama  Grenada  Chile  Uruguay  Suriname and Puerto Rico in their just struggles for their national interests  independence and territorial integrity.184.	We reaffirm our support for finding a solution to the border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela through bilateral negotiations. Furthermore  and in keeping with resolutions of the General Assembly  we express the hope that there can be an immediate beginning of negotiations between the United Kingdom and Argentina for the return to Argentina of the Malvinas  South Georgia and Sandvrk islands. At the same time  we must express our deep concern at the decision taken by the British Government to establish a military base in the Malvinas Islands  since such action would constitute a further obstacle to negotiations and a new source of tension.185.	We also reaffirm our support for the efforts of the Indo-Chinese countries to secure peace and stability in South-East Asia  without foreign intervention  and for a continuation of constructive dialogue between the parties to the conflict. However  we consider it deplorable and almost inconceivable that the Kampuchean people should not yet be represented at the United Nations by the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. This is an injustice  which must be corrected.186.	We reiterate our solidarity with the just cause of the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  in their aims of bringing about a peaceful reunification of the country without outside interference and of securing the withdrawal of United States troops from the southern part of the Korean territory.187.	Furthermore  we reaffirm our support for the position taken and the efforts made by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in the search for a normalization  through negotiation  of the situation prevailing in and around that country.188.	We also reiterate our complete solidarity with the people and Government of Cyprus and we support their efforts to preserve their independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment.189.	Once again we urgently appeal to the Governments of Iraq and Iran to end their war and to find a negotiated solution to the dispute between them.190.	It is deplorable that the Angolan Government finds itself still compelled to devote the bulk of its human and material resources to the defence of its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. The undeclared war imposed on us by the racist and fascist South African regime must cease.191.	The Angolan people longs for peace. It has never attacked anyone in the past and it never will. It merely wishes to live in peace and to work to build a future of progress and happiness within a just society of its own free choosing. The struggle continues  and victory is certain."
"3",99,"ALB",38,1983,"ï»¿177.	 Allow me first of all to express the Albanian delegation's sincere congratulations to Mr. Jorge Illueca on his election to the presidency of the Assembly. I also take this opportunity to greet the Secretary-General and to wish him every success in the accomplishment of his important tasks.178.	As at previous sessions of the General Assembly  the delegation of the Socialist People's Republic of Albania will express without reservation at the session the opinions of its Government on recent events and on the present international political situation in the belief that by so doing it will make its modest contribution to the cause of peace and security. We believe that only an open debate without illusions can be useful to the cause of freedom-loving peoples and countries.179.	The international political situation has in no way improved since last year. On the contrary  it is more turbulent  more complicated and extremely tense. Because of the policy of aggression  oppression and diktat pursued by the super-Powers and other imperialist Powers  many peoples and countries have had to face great economic  political and military pressure  endure innumerable privations  and even experience situations of war.180.	This situation is further aggravated by the world economic crisis which has gone on for many years now. The world economy remains in a state of stagnation; in a number of countries the recession continues  or growth has been imperceptible. The shrinking of markets has brought about a drop in world exports. The colossal debts once touted by the monopolies and Governments of the great capitalist Powers as the road to salvation and  indeed  to enrichment have now turned into new chains in which imperialism has bound various peoples and States. This entire situation has led to record levels of unemployment  endless price rises and a further deterioration in living standards. In many countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America  people are living below the subsistence level and genuine human tragedies are unfolding. Today it is becoming clearer than ever that the idea of a ""new international economic order""  in spite of the good intentions which may have motivated some  remains a Utopian idea  because the imperialists and neo-colonialists will never renounce their privileges or their positions of dominance. The latest example of this is provided by the recent session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which ended without result because the industrialized countries  with the United States in the lead  openly opposed the demands of the developing countries. Thus  it was confirmed once again that one can put no trust in the moralizing sermons of the imperialist Powers. We believe that the correct path is that of resolute opposition to neo-colonialist plunder  and the taking in hand and independent management of national assets. The developing countries are capable of imposing on the industrialized Powers their just demands for equitable trade in the economic Held and for cooperation based on mutual advantage.181.	The international political situation continues to deteriorate and is riddled with fresh conflicts; objectively speaking  it is the result of the stepping up of the militaristic and aggressive activities of the United States and the Soviet Union and of their rivalry for domination and hegemony. In every major event in the world today  in every regional conflict  we come up against one or both of the super-Powers. In one way or another  and in varying degrees  all peoples are faced with interference from them  and are threatened by the aggressive policies of United States imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism. In many regions and zones of the worldâsuch as Afghanistan  Lebanon  the whole of the Middle East  Central America  South Africa  South-East Asia  and so forthâlocal conflicts and wars are taking place  causing suffering and misery for the peoples.182.	The development of events in Europe shows that tension and insecurity on that continent are becoming even greater. It is true that many institutions  indeed a growing number  have been set up to ensure the security of Europe  that innumerable meetings have been held  and that there has been endless talk. Great fanfare accompanied the signing of the Final Act of Helsinki; the same applies to the Belgrade meeting and  more recently  to the Madrid compromise. But apart from demagogic propaganda  the peoples of the world have seen no concrete measure which would justify in the least the optimism expressed by the marathon meetings on European security.383. What good are all those meetings  documents  acts and resolutions when Europe has been turned into a veritable arsenal of conventional and strategic weapons  when the United States imperialists are piling up their cruise and Pershing II missiles in Europe  and when the Soviet social-imperialists have targeted their SS-20 missiles on European countries? False illusions are being fostered about the negotiations being held at Geneva on these nuclear weapons. But the European peoples cannot expect their security to come from the mathematical calculations which are offered daily to public opinion in the propaganda inspired and controlled by the superpowers  such as the proposals and counter-proposals on the number of missiles to be deployed on the continent. Accepting such sophistry would mean falling into the trap of the theory of the balance of power between the United States and the Soviet Union  and therefore submitting to their diktat.184.	Peace and security in Europe and in the world can be maintained and strengthened by opposing the aggressive policies of the super-Powers  giving them no opportunity to exploit their political and economic links with various States in order to harm the peoples of other countries and to attack them and jeopardize their freedom and independence.185.	Expressing the view of socialist Albania  the leader of our people  Mr. Enver Hoxha  has said:""Neither the Atlantic pact  the Warsaw Treaty  the military bases installed in various countries  nor the atomic weapons of the super-Powers can guarantee the defence of the European countries  their free and independent development  or their sovereignty and territorial integrity. These countries can guarantee them only by breaking up these pacts  sending the American and Soviet soldiers home  and smashing the political  economic and military chains with which Washington and Moscow have bound Europe.""186.	For a long time now we have been hearing statements and theories about the threat posed by the military blocs and their activities  but that is all empty talk if it is not accompanied by specific actions. That preaching becomes even more worthlessâindeed  harmfulâwhen its authors grant facilities and favours to the soldiers of the United States and the Soviet Union  thus giving the imperialist super-Powers a favourable ground for their further penetration and posing a threat to other countries and to peace.187.	For its part  Albania's deeds are consistent with its words. It will never allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory  nor will it allow anyone to infringe on or to threaten from its territory the interests  freedom and national independence of neighbouring peoples and States.188.	The Albanian people understands full well the opposition of millions of people in Europe and throughout the world to the arms race waged by the super-Powers and to the threat of war. It joins in that opposition  because it is only through the determined efforts of the peoples that the war-mongering plans of the imperialists can be foiled.189.	We believe that in the Balkans  too  the superpowers have stepped up their attempts at interference and at stirring up sinister forces and misunderstandings in order to keep alive the spirit of confrontation and to undermine good-neighbourly relations among the peoples and countries of that region.190.	The Albanian Government well understands the sincere concern about  and efforts to ensure the maintenance of  peace in the Balkans and will support any constructive and realistic steps to that end. It continues to believe that in order to strengthen peace in the Balkans it is necessary to oppose the United States' and the Soviet Union's policy of interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the peninsula  to take concrete steps to dismantle foreign military bases  not to give facilities to the super-Powers' naval and air forces  and to cut all links with the aggressive pacts they lead. Such steps would respond to the true aspirations of the peoples of the Balkans to live in peace and friendship among themselves. Socialist Albania has been  and always will be  a factor for peace and stability in the Balkans. It will not fail in the future  too  to make its contribution to building lasting collaboration on the basis of a policy of good- neighbourliness and the principles governing relations between sovereign States.191.	The development of the situation in Europe is also linked with the situation in the Mediterranean. The peoples of the area view with legitimate concern the activities of the super-Powers  which have militarized that sea and are practising gunboat diplomacy. When a small country dares to raise its voice about the extremely insecure situation in the Mediterranean  all sorts of accusations and even threats are levelled against it. There is much talk today about the pollution of the environment in that sea and about the measures that should be taken to clean it  but we believe that its cleansing must begin with the most dangerous and deadly pollution  by the evacuation of the fleets of the United States and the Soviet Union.192.	Much has been said at the United Nations about the situation in the Middle East. Many resolutions have been adopted and Israel's policy has been condemned  yet Israel has continued for decades on the path of aggression  expansion and colonization of Arab territory  driving the Palestinians out of their own land and committing monstrous crimes against them. In particular  the martyred Palestinian people has become the target of criminal attacks by Zionism and imperialism. Israel's policy in the occupied territories is one of genocide  of denying the Palestinian people its national identity. A year ago Israel attacked Lebanon  and it is now carrying out a de facto partition of that country. All this aggressive and expansionist activity by Israel has been directly encouraged and supported by United States imperialism. Moreover  today we see that United States Marines have firmly established themselves in Lebanon.193.	This stationing in Lebanon of United States troops  together with the troops of some European countries  is a precedent fraught with dangerous consequences. In fact  it means legalizing an act which  in one way or another  opens the door to a return to the old policy of the imperialist Powers  which  under the pretext of restoring order  used to send their armed forces to various countries in order to establish their domination there.194.	Present developments in the Middle East give clear evidence of a further escalation of the imperialist-Zionist plot against the Arab peoples. After Camp David  Israel attacked and occupied a large part of Lebanon and hit the Palestinian movement hard. Now it is concocting plans for the subjugation of Jordan  and it is seriously threatening Syria with war. The United States and Israeli military staffs are planning how to attack and dominate the Arab countries  one after another.195.	Israel's actions against the Arab peoples are also encouraged and promoted by the policy of the Soviet Union  with its plots and deals with the United States. It is a known fact that  for all the confrontations and clashes between them  those two super-Powers are also making efforts to reach agreement to the detriment of other peoples. This is obvious in the reciprocal concessions that they each seek so that they may act undisturbed  each in its own interest  in Afghanistan and Poland  in the Middle East and in Central America. In spite of the declarations made by Moscow and Washington and their attacks on each other  the theory of zones of influence continues to be applied.196.	The development of events in the Middle East is also part of a plot hatched by the East and West to squeeze and stifle the anti-imperialist revolution of the valiant Iranian people who  by resolute struggle  toppled the Shah's regime and drove the United States imperialists out of their country.197.	We believe that the Arab peoples and the other peoples of the region will not allow the imperialists and the Zionists to act to their detriment. They will find the strength to unite and to stay the hand of the aggressors. Experience has shown that when the peoples of the Arab countries close their ranks and strengthen their unity they have the force and the means to compel the aggressors to be reasonable. Th3re is no doubt that ending the armed conflict between Iraq and Iran  with their disagreements settled by negotiation  would serve the interests of the peoples of those countries themselves and the peoples of the Middle East in general and would contribute to preventing further super-Power interference in this sensitive region.198.	The Albanian people and its Government will always support the struggle of the valiant Palestinian people to gain its inalienable national rights. We will support the struggle of the other fraternal Arab peoples for the liberation of the territories occupied by Israel and their struggle to expose and foil the intrigues and plots of the super-Powers.199.	The Albanian people also supports the just struggle of the people of Afghanistan to liberate its country from the Soviet invaders.200.	The imperialist doctrine of inciting local wars  feuds and rivalries as a means of achieving domination and hegemony over the peoples concerned is also clearly seen on the African continent  where conflicts are fanned with almost periodic regularity. Chad is the most recent example of imperialist intervention. Its people are killed and the country is destroyed  to the profit of others. The Albanian delegation believes that the people of Chad can solve its own problems  and must be allowed to do so  in keeping with its national interest  without any external interference  no matter what the pretext for it.201.	The imperialist Powers are doing their utmost to keep Africa subjugated  underdeveloped and divided  so as to ensure the continuation of their neo-colonial exploitation of the continent. They do not hesitate even to support such regimes as the racist regime of South Africa  which is but another Israel in the hands of imperialism in Africa. Without the support of  first and foremost  the United States  South Africa would not have dared to continue to occupy Namibia and to suppress by Fascist methods the people of South Africa  who continue to live in segregation  deprived of all their rights. The African peoples have never accepted this situation; they have fought  and continue to fight  against imperialist intervention  racism and racial discrimination. The Albanian people and Government have firmly supported the just struggle of the Namibian people for freedom and national independence  as well as the struggle of the African peoples to root out colonialism.202.	A very grave situation has been created in Central America  where the United States has stepped up its pressure and its military intervention against the freedom- loving people of Nicaragua  and where it is financing and sending mercenary troops to suppress the struggle of the people of that region. The events in Central America prove that the United States cannot accept the situation created in what it considers to be its own ""backyard""  where the peoples have risen against oppression  plunder and exploitation. The peoples of Latin America are facing not only pressure and direct attacks by the United States  but also the manoeuvres of the Soviet Union  which is trying to use the antagonism between those people and United States imperialism to pave the way for its own penetration there.203.	The Albanian people are with the Latin American people who want to rid themselves of the brutal interference of United States imperialism. We support the right of the Nicaraguan people to live free and independent in its own country. We also support the struggle of the people of El Salvador  and the sovereign right of Argentina over the Malvinas Islands.204.	South-East Asia has today become the target of plots and interference by the super-Powers  whose policy is aimed at inciting division and at creating new conflicts in order to open the way for their own neo-colonialist inroads and their military expansion in that region. We have supported and will continue to support the right of the peoples of that region to live in freedom  independent of any interference or intrigue by the super-Powers.205.	The Albanian Government appreciates the withdrawal of part of the Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea and hopes that that process will continue. The superpowers have engaged in much speculation at the expense of the Kampuchean people  who have suffered for years on end from the savage onslaughts of United States imperialism and the massacres of the Pol Pot gang. It is high time for the international community to face reality and really help the Kampuchean people. On this basis  and abiding strictly by the principle of the inalienable right of peoples and States to be fully independent and to decide their own destiny without any foreign interference  the Government of the Socialist People's Republic of Albania has decided to recognize the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.206.	We hold the view that the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea must occupy its own seat in the United Nations  now unjustly held by the representatives of the Pol Pot gang.207.	Although the war in Korea has been over for more than three decades  that country remains divided. United States troops must withdraw from South Korea  and the Korean people must be able to exercise their legitimate right to live united in their own homeland.208.	In the light of the events that have occurred since the last session of the General Assembly  it is clear that to varying degrees the imperialist super-Powers are the protagonists in the turbulent and serious situation that exists in the world. Each of them strives to achieve economic  political and military superiority over the other  to acquire new markets and to secure spheres of influence. The crisis has made them even more aggressive. However  it is also a fact that the policy of oppression and exploitation  aggression and diktat is to an increasing degree encountering great resistance from freedom-loving countries and peoples. The course of events will show whether the imperialist Powers will lead the world into a new conflagration and catastrophe or whether the peoples will abolish war and save mankind. The struggle for national independence and for peace and security in the world  therefore  is closely connected with the unmasking of the aggressive policy of the imperialist super-Powers and stem opposition to it.209.	Our State has pursued an open and consistent foreign policy  based on principles. It stands for the development of relations and co-operation with all those countries that abide by the principles of equality  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  respect for the sovereignty of each people and for its right to choose its own social system. The Albanian Government has always shown good will and taken a correct attitude in the development of relations with other States. It has been and is against any diktat in relations between sovereign States. We will never compromise on the subject of distortions and insinuations designed to obscure our correct stands and demands. For 35 years now  Great Britain has illegally blocked the return of Albanian gold bullion plundered by the Hitlerites. This gold represents part of the sweat and toil of our people and it must be returned to them  along with the accrued interest. Our people will defend their interests strictly and with determination and will fight against injustices that they have been and still are suffering.210.	The economic and political situation in the Socialist People's Republic of Albania is a healthy one. Our people have achieved important successes in all areas  and in the fulfilment of their development plans  by relying on their own strength. The people of our country live free from the nightmare of insecurity about the future  because phenomena such as those to be seen in certain countries of the worldâcrises  inflation and unemployment  rises in prices  drug addiction and other illsâdo not exist in Albania. The well-being of the working masses is constantly on the increase and they look to the future with confidence. All the victories our people have achieved in the course of the four decades of the people's power are due to our genuinely socialist order and to the correct leadership of the Labour Party of Albania with Enver Hoxha  the great son of the Albanian nation  at its head.211. There are over-zealous propagandists who write innumerable pages filled with calumnies against socialist Albania  depicting it as a country that is mysterious  isolated  and so on. Of course  we do not expect benevolence and praise from people who are representatives of certain well-known reactionary circles and who have made it their profession routinely to invent stories based on hostile chauvinist positions. None of this worries us in the least. The truth is that Albania is forging ahead and daily becoming stronger  without loans or credits  by following a completely independent and sovereign policy. Although it is a small country  it is coping courageously with the various pressures and plots of the superpowers and is not deviating from its correct and honest socialist course. Our people are determined to continue along that course  because experience has shown them that only this has brought them continuous progress and development  as well as genuine freedom. 212. At this session of the General Assembly the Albanian delegation will share the efforts of all peace-loving countries and will not fail to make its contribution to the cause of the peoples  to genuine peace and security."
"4",167,"ARE",38,1983,"ï»¿ Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to extend to you  on behalf of the United Arab Emirates  our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will contribute effectively to the realization of the aspirations and the hopes expected of this session.313.	I am also pleased to express our gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  for his wisdom and skill in guiding the proceedings of the preceding session.314.	I am also delighted to welcome on behalf of my Government the State of Saint Christopher and Nevis as a new Member of the Organization.315.	We would like to express to the Secretary-General our support for his efforts to strengthen the United Nations and enhance its role in establishing a lasting peace based on right and justice  as well as on respect for the letter and spirit of the Charter. My Government shares the views expressed in his report on the work of the Organization  which portrays a gloomy picture of the existing international situation as a result of acts by certain States in violating the Charter  in resorting to arenas other than this Organization and intensifying confrontation and conflict  all of which have weakened the role of the United Nations as a forum for dealing with issues of international peace and security.316.	The cornerstone for building a world in which peace  security and friendship prevail among nations is made up of compliance with the provisions of the Charter and of international conventions  respect for the principles of international law and absolute confidence in the United Nations so that it can fulfil its important role in preserving international peace.317.	One of the most vivid examples of violations of the Charter and contempt for the role of the United Nations is the stance of Israel regarding resolutions on the Middle East situation  the question of Palestine and the aggression against Lebanon.318.	The history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has demonstrated that the question of Palestine is inseparable from the Middle East problem; that piece-meal consideration of some aspects of the Middle East problem will not lead to a comprehensive solution of either of these problems; that  on the contrary  this approach has led to further complications of these problems and to the repeated explosion of the situation in our area. In the light of this obvious fact  the Arab States  at their Summit Conference held at Fez  adopted a unified and integrated peace plan as a basis for the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The outcome of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held recently at Geneva  clearly demonstrates that the majority of the nations of the world endorse the necessity of bringing about expeditiously a just settlement of the question of Palestine that would enable the Palestinian people to exercise their inalienable rights.319.	The entire world has concurred that a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine and the Middle East problem should be based on two fundamental requirements: first  acknowledgement of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  and secondly  complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. Notwithstanding that concurrence  Israel continues to escalate its policy of consolidating the occupation of the Arab and Palestinian territories  of denying the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  obliterating the Arab character of the occupied territories  violating the sanctity of the Holy Places and their special status for Moslems and Christians alike  and destroying systematically the historical characteristics of the Arab and Palestinian territories in order to Judaize and annex the rest of them.320.	Concomitant with this policy of annexation and Judaization  Israel continues to pursue an aggressive policy towards the inhabitants of the occupied territories  a policy characterized by systematic oppression  murder  forced deportation of the population and encouragement of Zionist settlers  armed to the teeth  to commit massacres of the unarmed Arab inhabitants. The most recent of these acts was the attack on and the murder of students and members of the faculty of the Al-Khalil Islamic College  a situation before which the Security Council stood helpless because of the exercise by the United States of its veto power.321.	Israel erroneously thought that its policy of oppression against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and its invasion of Lebanon would destroy the will of the Palestinian people and their sole legitimate representative  the PLO. Yet this people has proved  through its struggle and perseverance  that it will not falter  submit or surrender  in spite of the massacres at Sabra and Shatila and other places.322.	The continued Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon threatens not only the peace and security of the region but also international peace and security; and it prevents a settlement of the Lebanese question that would guarantee the unity and integrity of Lebanon. Therefore the United Arab Emirates considers that the settlement of the Lebanese question lies in the implementation of Security Council resolution 509 (1982) and in enabling the Lebanese people to solve its internal problems. We welcome the cease-fire agreement arrived at by the Lebanese parties concerned  as well as the beginning of a dialogue aiming at the conclusion of a peaceful and just solution of the problem. At the same time  we appreciate the efforts made in reaching this agreement.323.	We call upon the international community to put an end to the crimes committed by Israel against the Arab inhabitants of the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories. We also call upon the United States of America  in particular  to play a positive role in resolving the question of the Middle East and Palestine and to bear its responsibility in that regard on the basis of right and justice. Similarly  the European States  too  should shoulder their special responsibility in finding a lasting  comprehensive and just solution for the Middle East problem.324.	With regard to the Gulf region  the United Arab Emirates  as one of the coastal States of the Gulf  urges all Powers to respect the sovereignty of the States of the region  to insulate them from the great-Power conflict and to leave the responsibility for preserving their security to those States alone. Similarly  we support the efforts to take the necessary measures for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace as well as for the genuine commitment to this Declaration by the great Powers.325.	The continuation of the war between Iraq and Iran  with its massive losses  threatens the peace and security of the States of the region and could serve as a pretext for intervention in the region by the great Powers. We believe that all Member States should sincerely endeavour to put a speedy end to that war  which has lasted all too long.326.	For our part  at the request of the Gulf Co-operation Council and together with the sister State of Kuwait  we have made sincere efforts to end this continuing bloodshed.327.	In reiterating our readiness to continue our endeavours and support all other efforts being made in that regard  we express our appreciation to Iraq  which responded in a concrete manner to end the war in order to reach a peaceful settlement that guarantees the rights of both parties. We hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will also be responsive to those endeavours and efforts.328.	We believe in the right of every people to choose the system of government it desires and in the non-intervention by any State in the internal affairs of another. On the basis of this belief  we call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan and for non-intervention in its internal affairs  thus allowing its people alone to choose its system of government.329.	We also urge the settlement of the conflict existing between North Korea and South Korea through free dialogue in order to remove the causes of that conflict and to realize the desire of their peoples for national unity without any foreign intervention.330.	Concerning Cyprus  we hope for the intensification of the efforts extended by all parties  in particular the Secretary-General  to reach an agreement between the Greek and Turkish communities of Cyprus that would guarantee security and coexistence for the people of the island  as well as the territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus.331.	The developments in southern Africa continue to arouse our grave concern  in view of the intransigence of the racist minority and its actions to perpetuate its control of  and its violation of the political and civil rights of  the majority of the population. The Pretoria regime persists in its policy of apartheid  its restriction of freedoms and its executions or arrests of leaders of the national movements.332.	In Namibia  that regime maintains its defiance of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  its frustration of the efforts of the Secretary-General and the creation of obstacles and difficulties  thus impeding the holding of the elections called for by the United Nations. The most recent obstacle was the formation by the occupation authorities of the so-called Council of State to draft a constitution for Namibia  contrary to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. My delegation reaffirms its support for the legitimate struggle waged by SWAPO for self-determination and independence for the people of Namibia. We strongly condemn the repeated aggression committed by South Africa against the neighbouring States.333.	The failure of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  held last year  was due to the fact that the four years between the two sessions on disarmament were characterized by a deterioration in the international system and by political instability. These were reflected in numerous violations of the Charter of the United Nations  in invasion and military occupation  in intervention in internal affairs and in violations of human rights.334.	We believe that arms control and disarmament can be achieved only in an atmosphere of political stability and confidence  in particular among the States possessing nuclear weapons. My country once again welcomes proposals for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Middle East. We hope that the international community will give this matter the attention it deserves  since it constitutes a basic factor in the establishment of security and stability in our region.335.	Recent developments in the world economy are not promising. Its various sectors  especially international trade and the international monetary system  have experienced a slow-down and erosion which have clearly had a negative effect on the economies of both the developed and the developing countries.336.	International trade has deteriorated during the past few years  and the negative results have had a stronger impact on the developing countries than on the industrial countries. The same may be said of the world financial situation and the international monetary system  the performance of which also demonstrates a weakness in the international economy. A comprehensive review and a radical reform of that system are necessary.337.	The conclusion that may be drawn from observation of these two sectors is that the economies of the countries of the world are interdependent. This means that the solutions to these economic problems should be comprehensive and collective  taking into consideration the particular characteristics of rich and poor States alike.338.	The international community as represented in the United Nations has recognized this reality and its dimensions. The General Assembly has adopted numerous resolutions on the establishment of an alternative economic system including those relating-to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade.339.	My country regrets the lack of progress in international efforts to reform the world economic system  particularly the failure of the international community to launch the global negotiations because of the position taken by some developed industrial countries. We continue to believe that the launching of those negotiations on a sound and effective basis would make a great positive contribution to the establishment of solid foundations for a just international economy. We also regret the negative outcome of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  despite the efforts of the States of the third world to ensure its success. That failure was due to a lack of seriousness on the part of the developed countries. What arouses our concern is that many of those States have started to retreat even from commitments they undertook at previous sessions. The continuance of such a situation would inevitably lead to a dangerous erosion of confidence and reduce international relations to chaos.340.	The United Arab Emirates reaffirms its support for collective efforts to reform the world economic situation  particularly those made within the framework of the United Nations. My country has done its utmost to this end  unilaterally and through regional and international organizations. Our oil policy as regards both production and pricing reflects our meticulous care to take into account the difficult circumstances facing the world economy.341.	My country sees the group of developing countries as a valid collective framework for achieving self-reliance  not as an alternative to international efforts but as truly complementing them.342.	In order to translate these policies into action  my country has contributed since its independence to the regional and international institutions which play a positive role in the growth and development of the other developing countries.343.	In the light of the foregoing  it is necessary to emphasize once again that the overall picture of the international situation  whether at the political or at the economic level  is not very promising. Our planet is confronted with various dangers and perils. This makes it more essential than ever before to call for caution and vigilance  to employ reason and prudence in dealing with issues of an international character  not to allow immediate self-interest to take precedence over the interests of mankind as a whole and to ensure for all a secure life and a future free from the threat of annihilation. Thus  international detente and the avoidance of tension in international relations should be given the utmost priority in order to create an atmosphere of mutual confidence. This will make it possible to promote the role of the United Nations and its various organs as a forum for constructive dialogue aimed at identifying the common denominators in the interests of States and thus freeing the world from tensions and crises.347. Our confidence in the ability of the United Nations to play a positive role in international relations leads us to emphasize the importance of strengthening and enhancing its role in the establishment of a lasting peace based on right and justice and by adherence to the letter and spirit of the Charter  thus fulfilling our hopes for a better future in which both small and large States will enjoy stability and independent development. "
"5",214,"ARG",38,1983,"ï»¿ Mr. President  first of all I should like to congratulate you upon your election to your high office at the present session of the General Assembly. I am sure that your contribution as President will be invaluable in ensuring our success in carrying out the tasks entrusted to us  especially in upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  which you have yourself so often defended in your capacity as a representative of your country in this forum and in the Security Council. Furthermore  my country wishes to congratulate  through you  the friendly sister nation of Panama  with which it is linked by a close and fruitful relationship based upon historical  cultural and political ties that indicate a joint Latin American destiny of sovereignty  development  justice and peace. Nor can I fail at this time to take note of the outstanding performance of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary  Mr. Imre Hollai  and say how much we value the ability and efficiency with which he discharged his delicate task. Today the world is confronted with a situation fraught with growing injustice  threats and insecurity that can only be the harbinger of new conflicts at the expense of the peace and the development of the peoples. The Argentine nation is convinced that the attainment of universal peace and justice will be possible only if a democratic system of international relations is established. This can be achieved only through the elimination of super-Power confrontation  the abandonment of aggressive and expansionist policies  the eradication of the apartheid regime and any other regime of discrimination based on race  creed or religion  and the final elimination of colonialism  neo-colonialism and any other form of foreign domination. The world cannot be regarded solely and exclusively as a stage on which East and West engage in a permanent conflict of ideological  political and military power. This would be to ignore the unjust system of relations between developed and developing countries. This North- South dimension is so serious that it demands special attention on the part of the great Powers which would make possible the establishment of a genuine dialogue and exchange that would benefit the whole international community. Furthermore  within the present structure of power relations in the world it is the developing countries that suffer the adverse effects not only of a clearly inequitable international economic order but also of the military adventurism of extra-regional Powers  the plundering of parts of their territory  the foreign exploitation of their natural resources  the establishment of military bases upon their soil and the maintenance of anachronistic colonial situations. What are the obstacles that must be overcome in order to bring about the necessary changes in present world circumstances? In the sphere of disarmament  for example  the international community must face up to a truly dire situation. It is paradoxical that when public opinion most energetically expresses its growing concern at the threat of a potential nuclear conflict  when the leaders of the major Powers publicize their apparent interest in reaching and desire to reach agreements on disarmament and when there is a universal consensus that this is a fundamental and pressing problem  the activities in the Held of disarmament have yet to yield tangible results. As we know  Geneva is the theatre of bilateral and multilateral disarmament negotiations  particularly in the area of nuclear disarmament. Obviously these negotiations are making no headway  and the efforts of the Committee on Disarmament are out of all proportion to the scant results obtained. Unfortunately the present situation and trends do not encourage us to hope for a brighter future. Nuclear arsenals are increased and improved day by day  so that the possible use of nuclear weapons poses the clear danger that any conflict could turn into a catastrophe that would spare no one. Moreover  not only are nuclear armaments being shipped without any restriction throughout the world; they are also being introduced into legally prohibited geographical zones  thus posing an unjustifiable threat and creating an atmosphere of insecurity that affects  first and foremost  those countries that do not belong to the major military alliances. Until very recently Latin America felt secure under the protection of a nuclear-weapon-free zone  but it can no longer feel free of suspicion since in 1982 the United Kingdom  in violation of its commitments  introduced nuclear armaments into the region of the Malvinas  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands  thus creating an alarming and dangerous situation. In this connection it is especially significant that at the eighth General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America  which was held in Jamaica last May  the introduction of British nuclear weapons into the zone and areas surrounding the Malvinas  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands was again denounced. Moreover  that Conference expressed its concern at the fact that the United Kingdom used nuclear-powered submarines in warfare within the zone established by the Treaty of Tlatelolco. Both cases constitute unprecedented and extremely serious acts that must be noted by the relevant organs of the United Nations because they call into question the very essence of the concept of nuclear-free zones. As a result of the painful lessons learnt since last year it is imperative to create mechanisms to verify the fulfilment of the commitments undertaken by the nuclear Powers. I am aware that I am not the first to draw attention here to the crisis in international economic relations or to emphasize that the developing countries are paying the highest price. But I cannot fail to emphasize that in spite of the efforts of these countriesâArgentina among them âto ensure the establishment of more just economic and political relations guaranteeing for them more equitable participation in the international sphere  some industrialized nations are determined to prevent this. Thus there has been a resurgence of protectionism in the large decision-making centres and discriminatory and selective policies have been established  on the pretext that they are based on a concept of ""graduation""  which create arbitrary and damaging differences for developing countries. Moreover  the emphasis on bilateralism in international economic relations has seriously eroded the multilateral framework of co-operation. And  as if all of this were not discouraging enough  we continue to perceive a tendency on the part of certain developed countries to use economic measures for political purposes  pressuring peripheral countries to make themselves subordinate in the exercise of their sovereign rights. My own country has been subjected to such unjust practices in the recent past. At the regional level  there was an understanding within the Latin American framework from the startâ which was ratified by decisions of the Council of the Latin American Economic Systemâthat the vulnerability of Latin America in the face of concerted pressure from the developed world had to be diminished. It was submitted that all nations have the sovereign right to follow their own path in the economic  social and political spheres in peace and freedom  free from external pressure  aggression and threats  and free from embargoes  blockades and any other coercive measures imposed illegally and arbitrarily. That is why Argentina has enthusiastically supported the important initiative of the President of Ecuador  Mr. Osvaldo Hurtado Larrea  aimed at mobilizing the energy and resources of the Latin American countries and recently ratified in the Santo Domingo commitment. In order to face up to this profound international economic and financial crisis we need fundamental solutions and the joint elaboration of principles and instruments for a new order in international economic relations. Along these lines  the developing world  represented by the 125 States members of the Group of 77  drafted what is called the Buenos Aires Platform' at the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group  held this year in my country. That platform stressed the urgency of adopting  at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  a programme of concerted and sustained economic reactivation and promotion of the accelerated development of the countries of the Group. Unfortunately  the industrialized nations preferred to take more rigid and opposing positions  and no satisfactory conclusions were reached at the sixth session of the Conference. Nevertheless  the solidarity of the Group of 77 was strengthened at Belgrade  and during this session of the Assembly the Group's members must act accordingly in order to face in a coordinated manner the acute international crisis. In this regard  the presence and remarks of the Prime Minister of India  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  who carries on with great dignity the far-seeing efforts of her illustrious father  Jawaharlal Nehru  will be of paramount importance in this forum  for  as chairman of the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries  she will voice the message of a majority of States which have a will to negotiate and which aspire to a world of justice and peace. The most obvious consequence of the exceptional situation affecting Latin American countries is their high external debt and the heavy burden of servicing that debt. We have constantly shown our willingness to make the sacrifices necessary to fulfill our obligations and to avoid moratoriums. But all the efforts being made to aggravate the already very onerous process of adjustment that has been carried out so far could strain the political and social tolerance of our peoples  which could have the most serious and unpredictable consequences. I wish also to state here the position of my country regarding some of the most serious current international conflicts. As a Latin American country  Argentina has a serious fraternal concern regarding the critical situation in Central America  which is characterized especially by political destabilization  violence  the constant threat of armed conflict among sister nations  and foreign intervention. In the face of this situation  my country once again reiterates its unchangeable position of full respect for the fundamental principle of non-intervention. It is that spirit that has from the beginning inspired my country's firm support for the Contadora declaration  signed by Colombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuela  and for the Cancun Declaration on Peace in Central America  which resulted in the encouragement of negotiations and contacts at the highest level on the part of the parties directly involved in the conflict. At the same time  the Argentine Republic wishes to make clear its conviction that the crisis in Central America is the result of many complex causes  such as anachronistic political  social and economic situations which have eliminated justice as the guiding principle of social organization  persistent violations of the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other States  and wrangling within the struggle for world power. My country  therefore  is especially interested in finding speedy and just solutions to save Latin American nations from these tragic problems. Similarly  we hope that Latin America and the Caribbean will not be dragged into a struggle for political and strategic objectives that are not in accordance with the genuine interests of then- peoples. When speaking of our continent I cannot fail to mention the historic meeting of reunion between Spain and Latin America which took place in the presence of King Juan Carlos during this year's celebration at Caracas of the bicentenary of the birth of the Liberator  Simon Bolivar  whose ideals of liberty and integration for our peoples we most strongly sustain. We are also deeply concerned about the attitudes of governments which persist in implementing policies that run counter to the Charter of the United Nations and to the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. My country attended the recent International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva  with the firm objective of helping to achieve a just and equitable settlement of that problem. Our presence attested to our conviction that it is possible to find a just and peaceful solution which takes into account the interests of all the States and peoples of the region. We reiterate today that such a solution demands the acknowledgement of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to national self-determination and independence and to the establishment of their own sovereign State. Moreover  it requires the acknowledgement of the right of all the States of the region  including Israel  to exist and to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized boundaries; withdrawal by Israel from all the Arab and Palestinian territories occupied since 1967  including the Golan Heights; and the recognition of a special regime for the Holy City of Jerusalem  pursuant to General Assembly resolution 303 (IV). We thus reaffirm the need for a peaceful negotiated solution  with the participation of all interested parties  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. Argentina has already condemned the violations of the fundamental principles of international coexistence of which Lebanon has been a victim. My country has strong and long-standing links with that noble and suffering nation. Today I wish to stress as vigorously as before that the attainment of peace in Lebanon is one of the elements of security and stability in the Middle East and that the independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon must be strictly respected. I wish therefore to express today my Government's satisfaction at the auspicious announcement of a cease-fire between Syria and Lebanon  achieved with the mediation of Saudi Arabia. We hope that this will be the first step leading finally to peace in the region. The situation m southern Africa is also one of serious concern for the Argentine people and Government. My country  supporting the struggle of Africa against colonialism and racism  has repeatedly condemned the intransigence of South Africa and its aggressions against neighbouring States  in particular against Lesotho  Mozambique and Angola  part of whose territory is still under South African military occupation. We are also convinced that international action on Pretoria must be accompanied by practical measures by the Security Council to eliminate the whole regime of racial discrimination and achieve genuine independence for Namibia. In this context I wish to reiterate the importance of the Latin American Regional Conference for Action against apartheid  held at Caracas this month  whose declaration	has been fully endorsed by my Government. Similarly  my country took part in the International Conference in Support for the Struggle of the Namibian People for Independence  held in Paris in April  whose Declaration and Programme of Action we wholeheartedly supported. We wish to express again our backing for the independence plan for Namibia approved by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978)  for it is the only way for the Namibian people  through its legitimate representatives recognized by the General Assembly  truly to exercise their right to national self-determination and independence  with full respect for the territorial integrity of Namibia  including Walvis Bay and the offshore islands. In the same context  any internal settlement or other constitutional plan that South Africa may wish to impose upon Namibia to perpetuate its colonial domination must be rejected. We further reaffirm that the independence of this Territory cannot be subject to the fulfilment of preconditions. The Argentine Republic fully agrees w : the statement of the Secretary-General  in his further import presented in accordance with Security Council resolution 532 (1983)  that no real progress can be made until a precise date is set for the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) and a cease-fire enters into effect. I must also take this opportunity to recall that Argentina supports the General Assembly's call to Iraq and Iran to put an end to their prolonged and tragic war. Furthermore  we wish once again to declare our support for and solidarity with the people and Government of Cyprus in their search for a just and equitable solution that respects the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment of that country  pursuant to the relevant General Assembly resolutions. In this respect we also continue to support the efforts of the Secretary-General. I cannot remain silent about the tragic fate of the South Korean commercial aircraft which brought about the irreparable loss of 269 human lives. This deplorable event has deeply shocked the conscience of the Argentine nation  which finds this yet another reason why it is imperative to create an atmosphere of global confidence based on respect for the law and linked with the maintenance of international peace and security  because this is the only way to avoid the tragic and senseless loss of innocent lives in the future. In my statement I have repeatedly touched upon situations that guarantee peace and justice in the world  two values without which no society can fully prosper. I have briefly listed some of the most important international conflicts  and now I must refer to the one that vitally affects my own country. There is no need to set forth again at this time the legitimate title upon which Argentina bases its claim over the Malvinas  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. It has been explained repeatedly at the United Nations and international forums and has been specifically organized by Latin America and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The latter has  ever since the 1973 Declaration adopted at Lima  constantly and unceasingly called for the restitution of the Argentine territories illegally occupied by the United Kingdom. Furthermore  the General Assembly and the Special Committee on decolonization have recognized the existence of a sovereignty dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom and are convinced that the negotiation process recommended by the General Assembly itself is the best way of settling that dispute and the other unresolved questions between the two countries. That is to say  the international community  through the General Assembly  has unequivocally decided on those territories are to be decolonized. For almost 17 years my country has unsuccessfully sought to obtain London's compliance with General Assembly resolutions 2065 (XX)  3160 (XXVIII) and 31/49 and with the Assembly's four consensus decisions on this matter. During this long period of time  the British Government showed not only a lack of political will or ability to solve the sovereignty dispute  but also an incomprehensible lack of sensitivity in failing to appreciate the importance of this question for the Argentine people. Recent official British documents clearly reveal that successive governments of the United Kingdom had an interest in delaying any diplomatic solution to the conflict while the Argentine Government was made to believe that negotiations were under way. This deception was furthered by defects in the international system  which does not provide for a truly effective procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes brought about by illegal and unjust situations  and the difficulties are further aggravated when one of the parties has the right of veto in the Security Council. The attitude adopted by the United Kingdom  the consequences of which we are all well aware of  not only remains unchanged but is now accompanied by a dangerous policy of militarization of the territories usurped from Argentina. This clearly dangerous policy includes the establishment of a military base on the islands  the illegal and arbitrary maintenance in Argentine jurisdictional waters of a zone excluding vessels and aircraft from my country  and the repeated resort to provocative attitudes and statements against Argentina. It seems as if the British Government is assuming that the United Kingdom can prolong its colonial presence on our continent indefinitely. Nothing could be further from the truth. The decolonization and recovery of the Malvinas  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands are a permanent and priority objective of the Argentine people  whose legitimate rights and vital interests are seriously affected by this colonial presence. Moreover  the restitution of the islands to effective Argentine sovereignty is a common cause for Latin America. The British policy of military expansion in the South Atlantic has been seriously and dangerously escalated by the recent decision of the United Kingdom to establish a strategic air base on the Malvinas Islands. According to British sources  the cost of the installation will exceed $600 million  and more than a thousand workers will be  employed on its construction. This is the approximate population of the islands. South Africa will be used as a base to provide support for this enterprise. Argentina has already denounced to the Secretary-General  the Security Council and the General Assembly the danger which the construction of this strategic air base implies for the security of the Latin American region. The United Kingdom has said in a note addressed to the Secretary-General that the aim of this escalation is to defend the islands against a supposed Argentine aggression. That is false  because my country has indicated that there is a cessation of hostilities which it respects  has respected and will continue to respect and that it believes that negotiations are the appropriate means for settling the sovereignty dispute  Moreover  the features of the strategic base show the disproportion between the supposed Argentine threat and the means used to counter it. Therefore  we must infer that the true purpose of the United Kingdom  a nuclear Power and a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is no less than the extension of its global strategic interests to the South Atlantic. These assumptions were fully confirmed by the British Secretary of State for Defense  Mr. Michael Heseltine  at a conference held under the auspices of the Center for Strategic Studies of Georgetown University in Washington  D.C.  on 14 September. As recently as that  this senior British official stated  among other things  that the Malvinas Islands were not at present an objective of the Soviet Union but that they would be in coming decades  and then the strategic value to the West of constructing the new airport on the islands would be clear. Perhaps with the intention of reassuring his audience  the British Defense Secretary added that the British commitment to the islands would not prejudice the role of the United Kingdom in NATO  because the expenditure of $600 million had been added to the normal defense budget  rather than subtracted from the expenditures provided for the alliance Mr. Heseltine also pointed out that the victory in the Malvinas had demonstrated the credibility of the Atlantic alliance's power of dissuasion and that  as a result of one of several conclusions drawn from the Malvinas war  the British Government had decided to improve its strategic capacity and air mobility to support operations outside the geographical scope of that alliance. What I have just highlighted clearly shows the seriousness of the situation and the dangerous effects of transforming the South Atlantic into a new source of conflict between East and West  which would do irreparable damage to Latin America. My country believes that it is the responsibility of the Atlantic allies of the United Kingdom to dissuade that country from the dangerous adventure it has embarked upon and to dissociate themselves from it publicly  to reassure the Latin American continent and all the nations represented at the General Assembly. Obviously  it is all the more urgent and necessary that  with the help of the Secretary-General and in accordance with General Assembly resolution 37/9  Argentina and the United Kingdom begin their negotiations as soon as possible. Argentina has repeatedly declared its resolve to negotiate. My country has publicly and officially accepted General Assembly resolution 37/9 and has offered the Secretary-General its full co-operation in the renewed good offices mission entrusted to him by the United Nations  but to this date this positive attitude has not been echoed in the least by the British Government  which has not only ignored the resolution but has at the same time implemented a policy based solely upon force and provocation. No excuse can justify the refusal of the British Government to comply with the fundamental obligation that it has  as a Member of the United Nations and by virtue of both the Charter and the General Assembly and Security Council resolutions  to find a peaceful  negotiated settlement of its problems with Argentina and to refrain from adopting provocative measures which contribute to increasing tension in the South Atlantic. The British Government's obligation to co-operate actively in achieving a peaceful settlement of this conflict is all the greater because the United Kingdom is a permanent member of the Security Councilâthat is  it is a country with a special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Therefore it comes as no surprise that the British Government should fail to find arguments in reply to those who  like my Government and some responsible circles within the United Kingdom itself  bring to its notice this serious violation of its international agreements and of the principles and rules governing international coexistence. The violation of the Charter by the United Kingdom cannot be justified even by the alleged need for Argentina to comply with formalities not required by international lawâmuch less so when  as is known  the attitude adopted by my country in relation to the cessation of armed hostilities has conformed with General Assembly resolution 37/9 and the provisions of the Charter regarding the peaceful settlement of disputes. Furthermore  the 14 and a half months that have elapsed since the cessation of hostilities confirm strict compliance with the resolution and the Charter. How  then  can one explain the British insistence on artificially putting this already solved aspect of the 1982 crisis at the heart of the problem? The only conclusion is that the only real explanation is the intention not to negotiate and to consolidate its illegal occupation by the establishment of a military base on the islands  as part of a policy of strategic expansion. Naturally  if the United Kingdom were to comply with the Charter and with resolution 37/9  refraining from implementing that aggressive design and putting an end to the illegal exclusion zone  the situation would improve. Argentina  responsibly and sincerely  calls upon the Government of the United Kingdom to re-examine its position  to comply with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly  and to resume in good faith the negotiations to settle the sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas. At the negotiating table  with the invaluable assistance of the Secretary-General  we shall be able to find imaginative solutions that will satisfy both parties and the interests of the inhabitants of the islands  thus ending a conflict that seriously affects our two countries and the Latin American region  and that  as I have already said  may have unforeseeable consequences. My Government also attaches great importance to Antarctica  an item included in the agenda of this session. For reasons of sovereignty  geography and history  my country is very closely linked to that continent. As far back as 1904 Argentina established an astronomic and scientific observatory on the Orcadas Islands. Since then a great number of scientific stations have given evidence of our active presence in the area. In 1959 my country was one of those which furthered and subscribed to the Antarctic Treaty  and  within the framework of its provisions  we have carried out a great many activities. The achievements of that Treaty should be emphasized here  since they have led to a genuine international co-operation for the benefit of mankind and the promotion of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. By means of the Treaty the Antarctic has been preserved as a zone of peace  where all military measures and tests of any kind of weapons  including nuclear ones  are prohibited. Scientific co-operation and exchange of information have been promoted and encouraged for the benefit of all States. One fundamental concern of the parties to the Treaty is the protection of the environment. This is reflected in the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources  which has been in force since last year. Bearing in mind the substantial contribution of the Treaty to the international community  my country firmly believes that any initiative by this Organization should lead to the consolidation of its provisions and the maintenance of a system that has proved effective. We are also determined to find a solution to the territorial dispute with the Republic of Chile in the southern zone  with the most valuable intervention of His Holiness John Paul II as mediator. His advice will surely lead us to a final settlement  acceptable of course to both parties  which will put an end once and for all to the dispute and consolidate the traditional links between the two peoples. In various international forums the Argentine Government has announced its intention of bringing about the full institutional normalization of our country by a specific date. This process has begun and the political parties representing all political trends have been reorganized. At the present time they are campaigning actively  in complete freedom and with the full guarantee of non-interference by the Government  for the election on 30 October of all future national  provincial and municipal authorities  ensuring the effective operation of a republican  representative and federal system of government. In 35 days my Government's commitment will be carried out definitively  showing how faithfully it keeps its word. I wish to reiterate this before this world parliament. There is no better way of helping people to enjoy complete democracy and freedom than by collaborating with them in ensuring their economic progress and social well-being  which are indispensable elements of their cultural and political advancement. By the same token  there is no better way of delaying and hindering such progress than by interfering from outside in the internal changes of those countries with the purpose of imposing upon them structures and customs that cannot be copied or invented but must be rooted in the unique character of each people. In the world's present exceptional and serious circumstances  the international community has no more urgent task than to assist the developing nations of Latin America  Africa and Asia. The world that is taking shape  the variety and number of new peoples  is an indicator for the future of mankind  because our immediate and long-term ideals and interests coincide with the universal aspiration to harmony and peace."
"6",274,"ATG",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 Mr. President  may I first of all congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. My delegation finds particular pleasure in your election since it testifies to the abundance of talent to he found in our region  Latin America and the Caribbean. Your vast experience of multilateral diplomacy within the United Nations with be much needed during a session which already promises to be of vital importance to the future of mankind as a whole. Beyond the policy statements which we have already heard from such a large number of heads of State is the crucial work which must take place behind the scenes to reconcile divergent views and turn dissension into discussion. Your well-known negotiating abilities will help to carry this session to a sensible resolution of the issues which lie before us.2.	I also wish to take this opportunity to welcome the newest Member of the United Nations  Saint Christopher and Nevis. This is a small island State  a neighbour of my own country  which has demonstrated that although it is small it is prepared to play a role in international affairs.3.	Apart from Saint Christopher and Nevis  my country  Antigua and Barbuda  was the most recent State to become a Member of the United Nations. We are a small island State  a member of that group of States that is militarily weak and economically vulnerable. In the wide scheme of great-Power politics  we are ignored because we do not point a missile at some other country's capital; we are marginalized because we threaten none with weapons of mass destruction; we are disregarded because we have neither the economic strength nor the inclination to intimidate other nations in the world community.4.	In other words  in a world that has become progressively more susceptible to the threat of power  small countries such as mine are discovering with increasing frequency that the principles of justice  equality  universal peace and development for which this body was created are nothing short of illusionsâillusions which now only scantily conceal the reality of naked power currently dictating the destiny of humanity as a whole.5.	Thus  in the drama of negotiation which is being enacted at Geneva on disarmament and arms limitation  the starring rolesâindeed the only rolesâ are being played by the two countries whose arsenals have the capacity for total human obliteration. The rest of usâ even though we represent the majority of mankindâhave no voice  no say  not a single utterance in those discussions which may well decide whether we live or die.6.	My people find it difficult to place their fate in the hands of any whom they cannot bring to account. Isuspect the majority of the peoples of the world hold a similar position. We are dissatisfied with the tyranny of the minority. We are frustrated with being discarded by a handful of countries. We deeply resent the arrogance which leads some States to believe that they have a God- given right to make decisions for the rest of us without dialogue and without discussion. Unless this wanton and wilful disregard for the majority of the world's peoples is corrected  global peace will always elude us and global stability will remain a meaningless dream.7.	Of necessity  the principal characters in disarmament and arms Imitations talks must be those who have so developed and stockpiled those weapons that their participation is mandatory. But the Assembly cannot abandon the task to them alone  for we are now all involved; we are now all consumed by the folly which threatens the extinction of the human race. We have an obligation to our own peoples and to humanity as a whole to bring an end to the madness of militarization.8.	In this context  Antigua and Barbuda calls for the fullest internationalization of the discussion on arms limitation and disarmament. At the least the United Nations should have a presence at the Geneva talks. But this body should also establish practical mechanisms to sensitize the peoples of the world to the dangers of arms escalation and to alert them to the frightening military technology which now surrounds us. For it is only through such methods  it is only by educating world opinion  including the opinion of the people whose Governments are the principal participants in the arms race  that we can hope to recall this planet from the precipice of mass destruction.9.	My delegation supports the proposal of Canada that a working group on arms control and outer space be established by the Committee on Disarmament. In our view  the Prime Minister of Canada is fundamentally correct that we can wait no longer if we are to foreclose the prospects of wars from space. Already it appears that faceless men  in anonymous offices in a few of the world's capitals  are determined to make a reality of science fictionâto play space roulette with the lives of people as the stake and ultimate destruction as the purse.10.	My country resents the fact that we are simply a pawn in a series of global war games. We call upon this body  we urge all nations  large and small  and we summon all peoples  white and black  to resist the tyranny of the minority and to call to account those Governments whose philosophy of militarism threatens the survival of all.11.	The South Korean airline tragedy in which an aircraft carrying 269 civilians was shot down by the Soviet Union brought the human face of cold-war politics brutally and vividly to the world's attention. We looked at that face and it was ugly. We saw mothers weeping for children they would never see again and wives fatally wrenched from husbands. We looked upon that ugly human face that could so callously cause innocent life to be slaughtered  and anger raged within us. There  but for fortune  could have been your wife  my children  your mother. The has come for the Assembly to demand a halt to the madness which produces such tragedy. The time has come for sanity to be recalled to international relations and to be given pride of place.12.	It is not as if these Governments are incapable of negotiation; it is not as if they are unable to reach agreement. During this debate and in a meeting of the General Committee preceding it we heard several countries which are normally antagonists tell us how they are able to co-operate in their mutual interest. Two very large Powers told us in a meeting of the General Committee that in Antarctica they co-operate one with the other; they exchange information and conclude conventions on exploitation of marine resources. We were delighted to learn of this co-operation. We recognize that we had not heard about their co-operation before because for 22 years all the meetings of the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty' have been secret  held behind closed doors. Not only the rest of the world but their own people were denied any knowledge of the decisions reached or plans made by that small group of States.13.	It took an initiative before this body by my small country  Antigua and Barbuda  together with another small country  Malaysia  for the world publicly to learn that two super-Powers co-operate in Antarctica in a way they failed to do through the cold war  the Cuban missile crisis and the invasion of Afghanistan. Further  it took that same initiative for the world to learn from the mouths of the representatives of two other countries which last year were at war with each other that they  too  are able to co-operate with each other peacefully and constructively in Antarctica.14.	My country welcomes the news of such magnificent co-operation among the Contracting Parties  and we call upon each of them individually and all of them collectively to extend this capacity for co-operation from Antarctica t$ other areas in which they are involved  including arm: imitation  disarmament and territorial disputes. Were they able to do so  the world would become a safer place for this generation to inhabit and for succeeding generations to inherit. The quality of all our lives would improve and the prospects for sustained betterment would be assured.15.	My delegation joined t le delegation of Malaysia in proposing the inscription of the question of Antarctica in the agenda of this thirty-eighth sessionWe are grateful that the General Committee saw merit in endorsing the inscription.16.	Antarctica covers one tenth of the Earth's surface. It is larger than Australia  larger than Europe  larger than the United States and Mexico combined and larger than India and China together. It is half as big again as the United States. It seems likely that Antarctica's continental shelves harbor vast reserves of oil and gas. It is known to have other minerals  and its marine life is abundant.17.	Since 1959 a handful of countries have arrogated to themselves the right to manage Antarctica under the Antarctic Treaty. They have thus far concluded a convention on marine resources and established a secretariat to service their activities under the convention. They are now in the process of negotiating a regime on minerals exploitation.18.	But there has been no consultation with other States; there has been no discussion with other countries. Of course  their response to this charge of lack of consultation will be that the Treaty is open for signature to all  but this ignores the reality that signature does not accord membership in the decision-making commission  nor does it take account of the fact that the presence of South Africa among the Contracting Parties makes it impossible for any State which genuinely opposes the vileness of apartheid to sit in the council of the decision-making commission of the Antarctic Treaty.19.	Antarctica is not so unique as to render a universal leper any less leprous.20.	We have asked for a study of Antarctica in an effort to take into account all the concerns about the area. Not least among these concerns is the environment and the damage that could be done to it  with untold harm for all the nations of the world.21.	These are not decisions which should be confined to a handful of Governments meeting in secret sessions. The world as a whole  including the people in those States whose Governments are now Contracting Parties  should be given the democratic right to hold known officials accountable for activities undertaken in Antarctica.22.	My delegation does not discard the Antarctic Treaty  nor do we devalue the 24 years of experience gained by the Contracting Parties in Antarctica. That experience and the Treaty itself could well form the basis for a consensual approach to Antarctica satisfactory to everyone. It is my delegation's hope that the Contracting Parties will support our call for a study and will wed the wisdom of their experience to the freshness of new perceptions which other countries can bring to Antarctica.23.	The President of the United States made an eloquent plea in the Assembly last week for all nations to uphold the original ideals of the United Nations. My delegation supports President Reagan in that call. Indeed  when my country was admitted to this body two years ago  I had the honour to state that in the Charter of the United Nations the peoples of the world had a sacred bond. I affirmed then and reaffirm now that my country places the greatest value and the highest importance on that bond  for  had we not  we would have chosen to remain outside this body.24.	Some States draw attention to the high level of their financial contributions to the Organization  as if an undesirable and heavy burden had been imposed upon them. We should all make it clear that we appreciate the contribution made by those States which pay the most. In this regard  the Assembly would be wanting if we did not take particular note of the very substantial contribution of the United States of America. But the financial contribution which my own small country makes to the Organization places an equally great burden  in comparative terms  upon us. We have no great industrial wealth  no massive population; we have no transnational that bring home money from abroad; our resources are meagre and our revenues miniscule. Yet  despite great hardship  we make our financial contribution to the United Nations and do so gladly  for we agree with President Reagan's observation that the United Nations and its affiliates have made more important contributions to the life of this planet.25.	In our view  the United Nations should be accorded the role for which it was intended  to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. In this context  it is a matter of grave concern to my country that yet another year has passed with Namibia still not independent. Indeed  social progress in Namibia has been further retarded and freedom hijacked by the heinous regime in South Africa.26.	South Africa's pre-condition that Cuban troops should be withdrawn from Angola before Namibia gains its independence challenges the very efficacy of the Organization. The tacit support given South Africa by some who sit in this chamber serves only to weaken the Organization which so many professes to value. And we should not be deluded by South Africa's assertions that it is under siege from international communism and is the protector of Western influence. No Western interests can conceivably be served by the oppression of South Africa's people under	or by the continued illegal occupation of Namibia.27.	The truth is that South Africa is not seeking to protect itself from the bogy of a communist threat  for a far more powerful spirit haunts it: the spirit  among South Africa's oppressed majority  which cries out for human freedom and dignity.28.	Violent abrogation of freedom and human dignity is not limited to Namibia. In Afghanistan  the Soviet Union continues to use military force to suppress the Afghan people. Resolutions by this body urging the Soviet Union to get out of Afghanistan have fallen upon deaf ears. My delegation deplores this continued occupation of Afghanistan  just as we condemn the Turkish Government for its occupation of Cyprus and its refusal to respond to the pleas of grieving families for information about their relatives missing from the Turkish- occupied sector of Cyprus since 1974.29.	The world would be in a sufficiently troubled state if the areas of military aggression were confined to those I have just mentioned. But in addition Kampuchea is still occupied by Vietnamese invaders. We welcome the efforts by the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations to seek a political settlement in Kampuchea  and we urge Viet Nam to join the search for a process which would leave Kampuchea in the hands of its own people.30.	The prospect of partition in Lebanon now looms large in the future of that agonized and war-torn land  where children are born into carnage with little hope of living a normal life. Last year  as the session began  the world mourned the massacre at Palestinian camps in Lebanon. This year  Lebanon's agony has known no surcease  its people no respite from the ravages of war. This country needs to solve its internal problems  but it will not do so while it is at the mercy of foreign troops. Lebanon would be well served by the international community if we collectively secured the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory and provided an opportunity for it to reassert its independence and sovereignty.31.	This body has been concerned for some time with the question of Korea. Peaceful reunification of this land best lies in direct negotiation between the two sides. The Republic of Korea has made definitive and reasonable proposals on this issue. If the North Koreans are genuinely interested in peaceful reunification  we urge them to respond positively to the proposals of the South.32.	Closer to my own home  foreign military intervention in Central America is helpful only in prolonging conflict. The cause of peace and stability in the region is retarded by those who seek military solutions to deep- seated social and economic ills. It is equally adversely affected by those who seek to exploit the difficult economic circumstances in order to impose an ideology  without the exercise of a free choice in a democratic process. My delegation welcomes the United States effort to look for other means of addressing the difficulties of Central America  through the work of a commission headed by former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. We are not prepared to prejudge the commission; we shall give it a chance and hope it produces widely acceptable recommendations. Meanwhile  we support and endorse the efforts of the Contadora Group to bring peace to the area.33.	I began this address by drawing attention to the fact that naked power now dictates the destiny of mankind. Dialogue and discussion  consultation and communication are words without meaning  illusions without substance. Small countries protest this domination and inequality  but we know we protest in vain. We have witnessed the failure of too many efforts to convene meaningful convocations on the international economic condition to place any hope in the possibility that the rich countries will accord importance to our survival unless it coincides with their own national interest.34.	Fortunately for the poor  the economic condition of the world has reached the point where  in the words of India's Prime Minister  India Gandhi   Each country  however powerful  has more to gain by accommodation and co-operation than by withdrawal into individual isolation or adoption of policies to maintain the solidarity of the strong . In other words  the global economy has now reached the point where for the strong to ignore the predicament of the weak would serve to court catastrophe for the strong themselves. Quite frankly  it is the reality that the rich are severely affected by the world's financial and trading system that provides my country with some glimmer of hope that at last we may be able to begin a series of discussions  however limited  leading to a change  however moderate  in the international economic order.35.	My delegation is impressed with a study recently undertaken by the Commonwealth Secretariat entitled  Towards a New Bretton Woods . Free of radical rhetoric and moralistic diatribe  it is a practical discussion of the means of creating greater multilateral co-operation within the framework of the existing institutions. This study is a positive contribution to solving the global economic crisis  for in our view only multilateral cooperation will extract the world from the economic morass in which it now languishes. It is now widely accepted that economic recovery in one or two countries  however strong they are  cannot provide the engine to pull the rest of the world to economic health.36.	Equally  it is time we dismissed the prescriptions of the medical economists in the North that the answer to the economic illnesses of the South lies in individual national efforts. Vulnerable to market forces amongst our major trading partners  dependent on the economic strength of the tourism market place  victims of high interest rates in the banking systems of the North  countries such as mine are at the mercy of the international system.37.	When we produce real growth  however small  in such adverse economic conditions  as we have managed to do in Antigua and Barbuda  it is a tribute to the resilience of our people. But as the Venezuelan Foreign Minister told the Assembly just a week ago  national efforts  cannot replace a global approach  with full and responsible participation by both developing and developed countries  .38.	My country calls on the Assembly to take special note of the need for special measures of assistance to countries whose small size and isolation place them at a peculiar disadvantage which constrains their prospects for economic growth. Those who control IMF and the World Bank group should be particularly mindful of the need to modify the policies of these institutions towards small States.39.	What is obvious in the world today is that we are in an age of intolerance  an age of confrontation  acquisitiveness and narrow-mindedness. These are the symptoms of a world divided against itself  with nations more concerned to grab their own narrow benefits today than to guard against global suffering tomorrow from which none  including the rich  can escape. That is a terrifying worldâterrifying in the scope of the destruction it can bring itself and terrifying in the obstinacy which propels it towards such destruction.40.	Despite the fact that my country is small and excluded  disadvantaged and disregarded  isolated and ignored  we are determined to play a part in recalling the world from such a frightening fate and in rebuilding a vision of prosperity and peace for all mankind. We stand ready to work with any committed to such a task. "
"7",319,"AUS",38,1983,"ï»¿144.	 Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you upon your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The experience of Panamaâand your personal role in that experienceâensure that you will serve in this high office with distinction.145.	The Australian Government also warmly welcomes Saint Christopher and Nevis  now the 158th Member of the United Nations.146.	In this year's report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General observes that the drive towards an effective  peaceful and more equitable world order has slowed  that the incentive to develop international institutions has weakened  that political will has dissipated.147.	He has urged a return to the far-sighted diplomacy of the founding years of the Organization and a recommitment by all of us to the Charter. The regaining of that vision and that commitment has become an urgent responsibility. We must recognize the extent to which we have drawn on the credit and credibility which underlie the whole operation of the United Nations. We must act with a genuine sense of urgency to re-establish the vitality and the authority of the Organization.148.	It is true that millions around the world have better livesâhave lives to liveâbecause of the work of the United Nations agencies. It is equally trueâand we must accept the consequencesâthat in the past 38 years a very significant proportion of the world's population has grown up judging the United Nations by what it has not been able to do. They are not just the people predisposed to scoff at the noble aspirations defined at the founding Conference at San Francisco. They include the most passionate believers in the civilized world community for which the United Nations stands. They have suffered too long being deprived of what this body can offer them.149.	We have the Charter. We have the principles. What we lack is the consistent will to implement themâa sufficient commitment to this institution which is the real and only expression of the international community. There are notable achievements on the United Nations record  but we c not overlook any longer those many unfulfilled expectations.150.	Mr. Evatt  one of the first Presidents of the General Assembly and a distinguished predecessor of mine  sought to guarantee the position of the middle and small Powers because he knew that they would need the United Nations most. He wanted limitations on the use of the veto in the Security Council and enhanced powers for the General Assembly. The importance of these ideas for an effective  participatory United Nations is undiminished.151.	Realistically  Australia accepts that it is not possible to go back literally to the structure and procedures envisaged in the 1940s. While it is true  for example  that the powers given to the Security Council to deter  prevent  punish and terminate aggression were thought practicable then  they are no longer so. Those sections of the Charter providing such powers were based on a great-Power consensus that was always fragile and  in the event  was short-lived.152.	Today the Security Council must operate by persuasion and consent  but it must operate better. A number of suggestions have been made in this regardâmost notably by the Secretary-General and by the Governments of the Nordic countries. It is the earnest hope of the Australian Government that the specific proposals to come forward during this session will be firm and practical  and that they will be acted upon.153.	Obviously  the Security Council is at the nub of any proposition to make the operation of the United Nations more effective  and the crucial element in what happens there is the state of relations between the superpowers. It is clear to us all  and acknowledged by the parties themselves  that the relationship is going through a difficult phase. I do not doubt that the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union are aware that a serious mistake or a breakdown in the management of that relationship could destroy us all in this age of nuclear weapons.154.	The United Nations was planned to be a forum for discussion of the major issues of concern to the world. But there is a responsibility we all shareâparticularly the super-Powers  but also the countries of the North and South  East and Westâto avoid undermining this institution by allowing it to become merely another venue for the pursuit of sterile objectives such as bilateral competition between the super-Powers or empty rhetoric by one group making unrealistic demands of another.155.	I appeal to both sides in all earnestness and good faith to pay regard to the wider significance and potential of this single all-embracing institution of the world community. The United Nations is all of us. I do not suggest a retreat from reality  only an effort to minimize the potentially crippling impact upon this body at a time when it is  we have to acknowledge  debilitated.156.	Obviously  the United Nations can never be fully effective without normal relations between the superpowers. I suggest only that we try to maintain it in the best condition possible until that time arrives.157.	There is one sense in which the super-Powers live in a world exclusive of others. They deal with each other on issues and on a plane that others cannot share. Yet all our destinies are potentially at stake in their relationship. And it is here in the United Nations that we who are not great Powers see our best opportunity to make known our shared concern.158.	It seems to us that these great and threatening tensions arise from fundamental misconceptions. The difficulty is to find adequate means of addressing those fundamentals when there are such compelling distractions in the flow of events within the relationship.159.	There is no ambiguity in Australia's position in the broad picture. We are allied with the United States. We are a democracy. We support democratic institutions and those that share our values. The Australian Government  like Governments of other democracies  expresses the will and the interests of the people who elect us. When the Soviet Union chose to destroy an unarmed Korean airliner we condemned its action in the strongest termsâand that  manifestly  was the feeling of our people. The same was true of the reaction in democratic societies to the invasion of Afghanistan. Democratic Governments reflect their constituencies  or they do not survive. By virtue of that same process  we can assure the Soviets with utter certainty that the people of our democracies have no interest in confrontation.160.	Whatever judgement Soviet leaders may make about the system in the West  they have no justification for a view that it is bent on the destruction of the Soviet people's security and welfare. In their theoretical analysis of the world and their vision of the future  those Soviet leaders must concede a secure and lasting place to the West and to the non-aligned and developing countries. It is not legitimate to seek the subversion and overthrow of these countries.161.	In the West  as we also assess future prospects  we must concede a proper place for the Soviet Unionânot only in terms of power but also as defined by the legitimate concerns and aspirations of the Soviet peoples. The extent to which those peoples have suffered in war and invasionâand not only in this centuryâis something almost beyond the comprehension of most of us. Yet that experience greatly influences Soviet judgements and policies  and must be understood. To understand is not to exculpate  however  when transgressions of proper international conduct occur.162.	Essentially  I am suggesting that wherever possible  we encourage and assist the super-Powers to moderate antagonisms  to obtain new understandings  perhaps to find new mechanisms for political action and consultation  and that all of us rid ourselves of dangerous stereotypes and misconceptions. The United Nations must be capable of providing some of those mechanisms. Unquestionably  the need is even greater now than at the time of the founding of the Organization. From this distance we may judge that there was excessive enthusiasm then for a body with the authority of a final arbiter. Today  we cannot expect it to be that.163.	Since the fragile consensus of the greater Powers disappeared  the Security Council has had to operate by persuasion and consentâa situation unlikely to change in the near future. Security Council members have a privileged position in the United Nations system. This is even more true of the five permanent members  and especially true of the two super-Powers. It is the view of the Australian Government that additional responsibilities accompany that privilege. The greater the privilege  the greater the responsibility. I hope the Council will begin to look more often to its composition.164.	I am pleased to note the Secretary-General's efforts to work more closely with the Security Council and hope that they will be reciprocated. It may be timely to review the whole body of procedures and mechanisms employed by the Council. Periodic and private meetings of the Security Council  as envisaged in earlier times  could be useful in the present climate. Private meetings may be helpful in developing arrangements for the informal examination of a dispute in its early stages.165.	The habit of having public debates after the fighting has started has not  as a general rule  been beneficial. When the Security Council meets during an outbreak of hostilities  it is difficult not to regard a demand for the cessation of hostilities as a minimum demand. Yet  the truth very often is that the demand is not practical and might anyway give an advantage to the aggressor.166.	One of the trends that has weakened the authority of the United Nations in recent years is the bypassing of the Security Council  usually for one of two reasons: the certainty of a veto or the likelihood of insubstantial action. On the latter point  it is not beyond us to devise a better methodology  taking into account the practical possibilities of information-gathering  United Nations involvement  initiation of discussions or negotiations between the parties and follow-up. As to the veto  valid arguments have been presented frequently for and against it  but it remains with us. In my view  however  we are entitled to expect that those who hold such power will use it with restraint and on the basis of considerations that go beyond mere self-interest. It does not exist to promote immobility.167.	The Charter was designed as a practical instrument as well as a statement of principle and the veto power is one practical recognition that all States are not equal in terms of power. It is a practical reminder that some Members are able to exercise a stronger claim on our attention than others. On the other hand  the Charter created a democracy in the General Assembly. Here  our common interests predominate. The Assembly and the Security Council should be mutually supportive in their relationship. The overall results should provide  for those many countries who need it  the assurance that the highest priority can be the well-being of their people rather than a costly pursuit of security.168.	To provide this assurance  I suggest  the United Nations must find the capability and the will to mount effective peace-keeping operations. As I stated earlier  the Organization has been notably weakened by being bypassed when such a need arises; yet there can be no expectation of effective United Nations action. Perhaps the most obvious feature of past peace-keeping ventures by the United Nations was that the war was already under way when the peace-keepers were sent. In these times when grass fires can so readily become conflagrations  we must surely think carefully about the scope for more pre-emptive action.169.	Along with remedial action in respect of peacekeeping  there is desperate need for revitalized United Nations activity in the areas of disarmament negotiations and the defence of human rights.170.	A fundamental area of concern to the United Nations and to all decent people is the need for vigilance in the preservation of human rights. The reality is that the United Nations and its Members have made great progress in this field  whether it is defined in terms of fundamental political freedoms  action against racism  action against sexism  or the general development of law and legal practice affecting human rights. But human rights  individually and collectively  are still violated daily. One of the fundamental tests of a principled organization like the United Nations will be its ability to protect the rights of individuals as human beings. Human rights are gravely challenged by deteriorations in economic and political conditions. Seeking to guarantee them in law is essential  but we must stop the common phenomenon of human rights being the first casualty of economic and political difficulty. We must stop this not only because it is wrong  but also because the seeds of a second round of violence are sown when human rights are ignored. Central to the policy of all Governments must be a determination to pursue economic and social policies compatible with the preservation of the rights of the individual.171.	The debate about the right to development  in the United Nations bodies concerned with human rights  is important in the North-South economic debate. We understand that human rights in the absence of economic rights seem hollow to the poor of the world. Poor men  after all  are more impressed with the provision of bread than with the abstract wisdom of Western thought. They are  however  best served when they benefit from both. Similarly  struggling developing nations are more inspired by guaranteed access to export markets  better pricing policies  adequate credit on reasonable terms and a fair flow of investment funds with which to promote their development than by the cold comfort of homilies about the fictitious free flow of market forces in international trade.172.	I have noted the emphasis placed by many speakers on the fragility and dangers inherent in the present international economic situation. The nature of these problems  as well as the need for the rich countries of the world to respond generouslyâand indeed  in their own interestsâto the economic difficulties of the developing nations  including the indebtedness of many third-world countries  is clear. If I can expand on a metaphor of Claude Cheysson  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France  which likened the potential economic failure of some developing countries to an aircraft stalling at the point of take-off  I would add that should crash landings occur  they would be in the midst of substantial slabs of developed nations' economies. The effect would be mutually crippling  not only in terms of the impact of failed major financial institutions  but also as a consequence of the disastrous impact on two-way North-South trade flows. In fact  if we fail to help remedy the economic problems of the developing world  we shall invest deeply and unwisely in policies which may well disable the developed world itself.173.	In these circumstances  the proposals for the new international economic order  the Brandt Commission report and the principles of the North-South dialogue should command more constructive and determined responses from the developed nations of the world than they have so far been ready to make. Some of the key proposals contain economic and logistical problems  but these difficulties are not reason enough for doing nothingâor  at most  precious littleâabout them.174.	As a democratic socialist Government  the Government of Australia is firmly committed to working constructively and practically in pursuit of the objectives set down in these various programmes and we wish that there would be an unambiguous declaration of renewed intent on the part of all industrialized nations to work towards these ends. In this way  we feel  the moral compulsions in defence of human rights are directly linked with a demonstrated and genuine concern for economic rights.175.	But nothing threatens human rights  life  or a decent standard of living more than war and armaments. During the last year we have witnessed in all parts of our heterogeneous world a rising voice against the arms race. That voice must be heard  especially by those in government who have the responsibility for making decisions.176.	What is at issue is a fundamental refusal by people all over the world to accept that humanity will be defeated and destroyed by technology. The question isâdo we run the machine or does it run us? Will the awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb overwhelm us and destroy us?177.	It is more than a rhetorical comment to say that nuclear weapons represent a genocide of the human spirit. Their destructive power is overwhelming. They represent an expression of the genius of man in science and technology. But to allow the genius to turn against humanity is to admit the final genocide.178.	As the Secretary-General has pointed out in his report to the General Assembly  the principles of the Charter are no more closely tied to the survival of humanity than in the field of disarmament. Interestingly  he has said that we need a recommitment to those principles. In this single word he has drawn our attention to a fact of vital significance  that is  that the principles are there  they exist in the Charter and that they held a livelier place in our imagination and our actions in the past than they do today. That place must be restored and strengthened. We must recommit ourselves to the maintenance of peace with the lowest possible level of armaments and to disarmament as one of mankind's highest practical goals. The need for this is urgent and this is what the people of the world are telling us. They will not accept that the system is out of control. They will not accept the arms-race mentality. The stakes at issue are far too high and the possibility of error leading to global catastrophe grows daily and in direct proportion to the introduction of every new nuclear-weapon system.179.	The Australian Government is committed to the arms control and disarmament goals of the United Nations  as enshrined both in the Charter and in the substantial fabric of international law that has been developed since the Organization came into existence. That body of law should be developed further and adhered to universally. One of the Australian Government's first actions following its election was to make policy decisions in the disarmament Held which elevated disarmament and arms control goals to the required level of priority within our foreign policy  particularly in relation to our role within the wider world community. It did this motivated by the certain knowledge that this was what the Australian people wanted.180.	Australia is determined that there will be an end to the nuclear arms race and a reduction in the number and kinds of nuclear weapons held by nuclear-weapon States. We are determined that the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons shall be strengthened and adhered to universally. Linking these two objectives  we are determined that there should be an end to nuclear testing in all environments for all time. We will seek  with all the vigour possible  an international agreement to ensure that the arms race does not extend to outer space.181.	Nuclear issues are central to the survival of mankind  but people die daily  and in alarming numbers  through the use of conventional weapons. The arms trade is running at some $700 billion a year. This is a major threat to life and human rights. It provides no security. It is manifestly an illusion to believe that security stems from the barrel of a gun  and the allocation of resources to this trade  instead of to development and the promotion of decent standards of living  is a scandal of monumental proportions.182.	Military budgets must be reduced. The arms trade must be curbed. Action must be taken to stop the black- market trade in arms. Australia believes that these three goals are ideal subjects for negotiation by the United Nations. Accordingly  we will be promoting action on them.183.	Chemical weaponsâthe so-called poor man's atomic bombâare abhorrent. Their effects are devastating and inhumane. They are cheap and easily stored. They are ideally suited to the non-industrial world  and they must be outlawed. Australia will try to see an international convention developed that will have this effect.184.	I should like now to turn to several issues of particular concern to Australia.185.	Australia is and will always be a part of the Southeast Asian and South Pacific region. We are naturally concerned that a stalemate continues over the Kampuchean question. This perpetuates a situation of instability between the countries of Indo-China and neighbouring countries  in which the immediate victims are the Kampuchean people themselves. Australia favours a political solution in Kampuchea. We do not support any approach based on a continuation of the present military activity. Any resolution of the conflict will need to include such basic requirements as the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea and a form of self-determination for the people of that country. Unfortunately I expect no quick solution.186.	With regard to southern Africa  we fully understand the frustration expressed by many delegations that the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on Namibia should have been obstructed for so long. It is clear now that the long-delayed independence of Namibia is being held up by extraneous issues not encompassed in the United Nations plan  such as its linkage with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. Australia believes that those extraneous issues should not be allowed to impede Namibia's accession to independence.187.	I am also concerned to note that the repugnant system of apartheid continues without meaningful modification in South Africa. It is abhorrent to the human spirit that the State should exercise such blatant discrimination against its own citizens on the basis of race. This in turn sows the seeds of instability as the State continues to find it necessary to suppress the aspirations of those seeking to give expression to their rights.188.	Last year at this time the General Assembly expressed its anguish at the cruel events which had engulfed Lebanon and its people. It is a tragedy that Lebanon is still in the grip of turmoil and conflict. It is more than ever urgent that the conditions be created to enable the Government of Lebanon to assert its authority over its sovereign territory. We welcome the cease-fire as an indispensable first step towards a peaceful settlement. We sincerely hope that all sides in the conflict will be able to meet in a genuine effort to find a solution to Lebanon's internal problems in the knowledge that Lebanon's hopes for the future lie in dialogue.189.	The tragedy of Lebanon has also served to emphasize yet again the continuing and pressing need for a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the Middle East dispute. For Australia  this means the need to sustain the right of Israel to exist behind secure and recognized borders. That is an absolute commitment. But  equally  it means recognition of the central importance of the Palestinian issue in any settlement. The Australian Government acknowledges the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people  including their rights  if they so choose  to independence and the possibility of establishing their own independent State. The Australian Government also recognizes that any arrangement finally agreed upon will evolve from processes involving the peoples of the immediate region  including those of Syria and Jordan. The roles and views of the super-Powers cannot be ignored in any such process.190.	Earlier this year I noted  on behalf of the Australian Government  that Indonesia had incorporated East Timor in its territory  and at the same time I expressed our concern that an internationally supervised and accepted act of self-determination had not taken place. Australia notes the decision of the Assembly to defer consideration of the situation in East Timor until the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We hope that Indonesia and Portugal will be able to use the time between now and the next session to reach a lasting settlement of this question  a settlement which will take into account the best interests of the people of East Timor.191.	Tensions in Central America have increased since the last session of General Assembly. Australia believes that solutions to the problems of this region lie in the maintenance of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and in the efforts directed towards domestic reforms and reconciliation. Australia therefore welcomes and supports the important role the countries of the Contadora Group are now playing in seeking to develop a dialogue and a consensus among the countries of the region.192.	Before concluding my statement  I feel obliged to turn to an issue which is on the agenda of the General Assembly for the first time and which is of particular importance to Australia  namely  Antarctica.193.	The Antarctic Treaty is a uniquely successful international instrument of co-operation. It is a major disarmament agreement and excludes all military activities. It forbids nuclear explosions in Antarctica and prohibits the dumping of nuclear waste. There is a comprehensive system of on-site inspection  with observers being guaranteed freedom of access at any time to all areas of Antarctica. The resulting demilitarization and denuclearization of the continentâto which the two super-Powers are partiesâis of great value to mankind and of specific value to Australia as a neighbouring continent.194.	The Antarctic regime is also an instrument of conservation and management of resources.195.	I should add that the Treaty is not exclusive. Any State may accede  and 28 nations with diverse economic and political interests have already done so. The most recent adherents to the Treaty are India and China.196.	Australia is concerned about the introduction of this matter into the United Nations lest the substantial achievements of the Treaty system be put at risk. The United Nations was created to solve problems  not to create new ones.197.	It is the opinion of the Australian Government that any attempt to negotiate a new international agreement on Antarctica or to renegotiate parts of the Treaty would prove counter-productive and introduce uncertainty and possible instability into a region of hitherto unparalleled international harmony.198.	The United Nations symbolizes and provides the framework for the steady  almost relentless  growth of a sense of world community. This sense of world community is a unique feature of the twentieth centuryâa product of communications technology  economic development and political consciousnessâand this sense of world community will continue to grow with the inevitable increase in interdependence.199.	In this context  the United Nations is absolutely essential. Indeed  its great achievement has been that for almost 40 years now  it has given effective and continuing expression to this new dimension of the community of nations. It has done this in a period of unparalleled change  including the era of decolonization  over which it presided  and major shifts in the disposition of power. To compare the agenda and compass of this body with those of the League of Nations 50 years ago is to appreciate why one has endured and the other could not. The evolution of this essential institution cannot be allowed to falter now.200.	We cannot escape the fact that the process is becoming more and more difficultânot least because this growing sense of world community sits uneasily with the system of nation States that were chosen as the basis of our political system. The inherent tension between notions of untrammelled national interest and a growing sense of world community present our greatest challenge  as individual Governments and as United Nations. We face great enough pressures individually; the United Nations must bear the sum of these conflicts and manage them constructively.201.	The alternatives are limited: a world  in a state of perpetual tension  dominated by a handful of great Powers  or a resort to arms that would leave very little future for any of us. These  I remind the Assembly  were the very things the United Nations was created to eliminate. "
"8",366,"AUT",38,1983,"ï»¿ It is a particular pleasure tocongratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. His outstanding diplomatic skills and great experience in foreign affairs  aswet as his long association with the work of the UnitedNations  will considerably facilitate our difficult taskduring the weeks ahead and greatly contribute to thesuccessful conclusion of this session.I also wish to convey to his predecessor  Mr. ImreHollai  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary sincere thanks and high appreciation for his tact political understanding and tireless personal efforts Inconducting the affairs of the General Assembly over thepast year.S3. The thirty-eighth session takes place against thebackground of a serious international situation. The danger of nuclear war casts a dark shadow over the futureof mankind. Perennially unresolved conflicts bring untoldsuffering to many regions of the world. They are oftenexacerbated by super-Power rivalry. Thestructural imbalances of the global economy  it conjunction with the present economic crisis  condemn the greaterpart of humanity to a life of poverty and want. Increasingdisregard of human rights  persistent racial discriminationand the repression of people: struggling for their nationalrights weigh heavily on the conscience of mankind.184. The stakes are the highest and progress is mosturgently required in the area of arms control and disarmament. Tate development of weapons technology combined with changes in strategic thinking threaten toundermine the already precarious balance of terror andincrease the risk of nuclear war. These dangerous trendsaffect the security of all States and all peoples. Wetherefore believe that everyone and every Governmentmust participate in the struggle against the nuclear threat.In many parts of the world  mass movements are gathering strength and demanding an end to the neuter arms build-up.Austria  a stall neutral country situated betweenthe two military bios in the most highly armed regionof the world  naturally shares the concerns and ideals ofthe peace movement. The ultimate responsibility forhalting the nuclear arms race  however  rests squarelywith the nuclear-weapon States. Austria appeals urgentlyto the United States and the Soviet Union to exercise intheir talks at Geneva the necessary political will to conclude genuine and substantial disarmament agreements.Let us transform the balance of terror into a balance ofreason.t86. After long and arduous negotiations  conductedunder difficult international conditions  the Madridfollow-up meeting to the Conference on Security andCo-operation in Europe was concluded successfully. Thedecisions at Madrid have father developed the 1975 FinalAct of Helsinki. They constitute a code for building amore constructive and stable relationship between Eastand West. In spite of the deep crisis in East-West rotationsand the ever-accelerating arms race  all participants in theConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe including the big Powers  have demonstrated their interestin continuing the process of detente. Austria will spareno effort in contributing actively to the success of thisprocess. We note with satisfaction that the next follow-up meeting will take place at Vienna In 1986.187.	The conclusion of the Madrid meeting proves thatsincere negotiating efforts can succeed. Its example mustbe followed in other areas  in particular disarmamentnegotiations  on the success or failure of which rests thesurvival of mankind. Apart from the ongoing negotiations  the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  whichwill begin In January 1984 at Stockholm  wilt offer thebest opportunity in this regard. Of course  this requiresat cast a minimum of good will and mutual confidence.188.	The tack of these pre-conditions was demonstratedonly recently in a frightening manner by title shootingdown of a civilian airliner. The Austrian Governmentunequivocally condemns this act. The international community justly demands a thorough investigation of thecircumstances which led to this catastrophe and the punishment of those responsible  as well as appropriatecompensation to the families of the victims. We alsobelieve that effective intimation measures will have tobe taken to prevent the recurrence of sue a horribleevent.89. The United Nations has an important role toplay in the disarmament process. The negotiations inthe Committee on Disarmament  title deliberations onarms limitation in other organs and the efforts to buildpublic support for disarmament should be intensifiedand expanded. During this Genera Assembly sessionthe Austrian delegation wilt pursue its initiative concerning measures to facilitate objective information on themilitary strength of States. The availability of objective and reliable information would enhance confidencebetween States and promote the conclusion of disarmament agreements.190. White the cost of arms race reached $800 billionin 1982  the lives of two thirds of mm kind are still dominated by poverty and hunger. One tenth of the annualexpenditure on armaments would be enough to financethe annual debt servicing of at developing countries.After years of recession 'he prospects for an economicrecovery have finally improved  but the upswing is as yetinitiated to a few industrialized nations and even they donot know how long it will last. It will there/ore be ofcrucial importance that these trends be transformed intoa sustained recovery for all.9. 1 is convinced that stabilizing factors for a world-wide and lasting economic recovery must be created orrecreated  The growth of world trade and production canbe built only upon the foundation of predictable exchangerates  open markets unimpeded by protectionism  a balanced development of prices for commodities and industrial goods and a step-by-step increase of resourcetransfers from the ""haves"" to the ""have-nots"". How tocreate these conditions  these confidence-buildingmeasures  for the world economy should be discussedglobally. Without a commonly accepted target  no realtyfruitful sectoral decision can be made. Laissez-faire ispassed. To leave the poorest to the ups and downs ofeconomic power play is as inhuman as it is counterproductive.IK. Peace and well-being can be assured only if atcountries in all regions share more equitably in the worldseconomic progress  Austria is firmly convinced of thenecessity of the North-South dialogue and for its partwill continue to Increase the scope of its developmentco-operation.193. Austria believes that the observance and promotionof human rights constitute not merely an abstract principle but also practical policy. Such a policy assumes evengreater importance in a world beset by armed conflicts political upheavals and economic crises. Therefore allthose individuals and movements that fight against oppression and the denial of their rights everywhere in theworld may count on Asiaâs friendship.t94. in spite of the coexistence of clear legal norms grave violations of human rights occur every day in manyparts of the world. We continue to witness unjustifiedarrests  torture  arbitrary executions  religious intoleranceand political persecution.tom.  The forthcoming thirty-fifth anniversary of themotion of the Universal Declaration of Human RightsWade provide the occasion for all States truly to put intothe observance of human rights to which wewe all committed ourselves. The United Nations has animportant role to play in this context. In our view thisrote should be strengthened and further developed so asto ensure the effective international pt. intention of humanrights.196.	The international situation is characterized bymany regional conflicts.197.	The Middle East continues to be one of the mostdangerous crisis areas of the world. The implicationsof this conflict transcend the confines of the region.World peace and international security are nowhere moredirectly threatened than in the Middle East. The humanand humanitarian dimension of this conflict must not beoverlooked either. Every day the cycle of hatred  repression and the use of force claims more victims and createsnew obstacles to peace.198.	The past year has not brought us closer to a set-statement of the Middle East problem. Lebanon is stilloccupied by foreign troops and threatened by civet war.Israel pursues its settlement policy on the West Bankleading towards a tacit annexation of those territories.This policy is in contravention of international tawand runs counter to any peaceful solution of the MiddleEast conflict. The action of tots Extract Government isincreasingly resulting in a serious deterioration in theeconomic and social situation of the Palestinian populations. It thus gives rise to deep concern for humanitarianreasons as wait.199.	Peace efforts in the Middle East have at presentcome to an ominous stalemate. Many of those involvedseem to pursue short-term and narrowly defined nationalinterests  regardless of the dangerous implications foroverall development in the region. Austria strongly believes that this attitude must be changed and replaced bya sincere effort to bring about a just solution. Such asettlement can be achieved only through negotiations anddialogue. We reject unequivocally the use of force andalt acts of terrorism  from whatever side 200.	Austria's position on the principles of a just andcomprehensive solution of the Middle East problemremains unchanged. The right of at States in the region including Israel  to exist within secure and recognizedboundaries must be respected. The Palestinian questionis at the core of the Middle East problem. As underlinedat the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held recently at Geneva  a solution requires recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people including the right to its own State. Austria shares theview that the PLO  as the representative of the Palestinians  must participate in all negotiations. The acquisitionof territories by force is unacceptable. Israel must therefore withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967 including Jerusalem.201.	The restoration of fuel sovereignty and territorialintegrity to Lebanon constitutes an essential element ofa comprehensive peaceful settlement. No foreign troopsshould remain in Lebanon without the consent of theLebanese Government. At efforts must be made in Lebanon to bridge the internal divisions and to achievenational reconciliation. Like those directly suffering fromcivil war in Lebanon  we are glad that a cease-fire couldbe implemented  but a political solution must followimmediately. Only on such a basis will it be possible torebuild a peaceful and independent Lebanon. But thisobjective too can be reached only if we succeed in findinga aerate solution for those Palestinians living in Lebanon. Where should they go This question is a further?example of the fact that the core proem of the MiddleEast conflict is the question of Palestine. Unless thePalestinian people can exercise its national rights  therecan be no lasting peace  either in Lebanon or in any otherpart of the region.202.	The war between Iran and Iraq has net red itsfourth year. The loss of human life and the waste ofresources have reached staggering proportions. Austriaappears to both parties to cease this senseless struggle andto seek a peaceful settlement of their dispute. We watermenand support at mediation efforts that may contribute tothis end.203.	The armed intervention in Afghanistan continuesto cause immense human suffering and is a serious threatto the stability of the entire region. This persistent violation of fundamental principles of the Charter of theUnited Nations also constitutes a major obstacle to theimprovement of East-West relations. Austria urges allparties to support the mediation efforts by the Secretary General and his special representative and to muster thenecessary polities will to achieve agreement on those keyelements whet still remains unsolved. The Kampuchea problem is another matter ofserious concern. Here the past year has brought certainsigns of greater flexibility  but at the same time the military occupation  tit use of force  the misery of refugeesand the dental of title basic human rights have continuedunabated. Austria remains convinced that only negotiations between ail parties to title conflict on the basis ofthe resolutions of the General Assembly and of the International Conference on Kampuchean can idea to a Justsettlement which could ensure a better future for theseverely tried Kampuchea people.205.	Tate situation in Cyprus underlines the urgency ofa comprehensive negotiated settlement. Respect for sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity and compete withdrawal of the occupying forces constitute  inour view  an essential basis for such a settlement. Austriastill considers the talks between the two communities tobe the best means to stave their problems between themselves. We fruity appreciate and support the efforts undertaken in that regard by the Secretary-Genera ""tad hisspecial representative.206.	The people of Namibia are still waiting for theirindependence. Four years of work on the basis of SecurityCouncil resolution 435 (1978) have led to a large degreeof agreement on the details and the incrimination ofthe transition plan. Elements which  in our view  do nothave direct relevance to the independence of Namibiamust not impede that process. We strongly support theSecretary-Generaâs efforts to break the deadlock andfinally to bring about the implementation of the UnitedNations pain for Namibia.207.	The underlying cause for the crisis situation insouthern Africa is the policy practised by theSouth African Government. Austria unequivocally condemns the	system as an abhorrent violation ofhuman rights and human dignity. Only a profound transformation of South Africa into a free  democratic andmultiracial society could bring genuine stability to thesouth of Africa  ft. is indispensable that this process beinitiated without delay. Only in that way can it be peacefully concluded  as we hope it will be.208.	The continuing serious situation in Central America matter of deep concern to Austria. We considerthis crisis closely related to the profound soda changethis region is undergoing. Exploitation  injustice andrepression throughout centuries are the root causes of thecurrent proteins. Arty approach to the central Americancrisis which reduces it or primarily to a matter ofEast-West confrontation or to a question of spheres ofinfluence or competing ideologies without aggravate thesituation. A settlement cannot be it posed front outsideor by title use or threat of use of force. It must be reachedthrough free negotiations between all parties directlyconcerned. Austria welcomes  in particular  the effortsby the Contadina Group. Self-determination  n -interfence  respect for title territorial integrity of States  theobligation not to use title territory of a State for acts ofaggression against another  the peaceful settlement ofdisputes and the prohibition of the use and threat of useof force are indeed title only principles on which a stableand lasting solution can be based.209.	Austria how always put special emphasis on a pockof good-neighbourliness. Over title past year Austria hasbeen able to improve and deepen co-operation with allits neighbours  irrespective of their social and politicalsystems.210.	It our good-neighbourly and friendly relationswith Italy present the problem of South Tyrol has a special place.The resolutions of General Assembly led to an agreement between Austria and Italy on a new frameworkof autonomy for South Tyrol. Among its importantprovision there is that on the use of the German language andthe establishment of an autonomous section in Boxed ofthe Administrative Court are of special significance forthe preservation of South Tyrolean ethnic group.Despite the agreement in principle reached months agobetween the Government and the minority concerned  decisions relating to these important measures have still not been enacted. Austria is aware that this isparity due to recent political developments in Italy. However  Austria views with a certain concern the met thatcompetence already transferred to the Province of Bonzehas again been eroded by national legislative measuresand that acts adopted by the provincial legislature areincreasingly rejected by the authorities in Rome. Thesemeasures have added considerably to the anxiety andconcern already experienced by the population of SouthTyrol because of the delay in the implementation of theautonomy provisions. Prime Minister Benedetto Croixhas stated recently that the two provisions just mentionedwill be implemented in the coming months. The AustrianFederal Government expects this promise to be fulfilledas soon as possible. We are confident that this wouldcreate an important pre-condition of early  generallyacceptable attainment of autonomy in South Tyrol.211.	in addressing the critical problems of today'sinternational situation States have two basic options: theycan exploit the existing problems in the pursuit of short-term national interests or they can seek to solve themthrough co-operation in the long-term interest of theinternational community as a whole. This second alternative was outlined 38 years ago in the Charter of theUnited Nations. The Organization's founders lay downthe fundamental rules of co-operation among States andcreated institutions to translate these primaries into amore peaceful and humane world order.212.	The ideas and Easter approaches of the Charter areas valid today as they were in the past. Yet in our increasingly complex and divided world  the Mute of purposewhich was still present in the aftermath of the most?terrible war in human history is waning. Todayof the precepts of the Charter proliferate. The Security Council  the primary organ for the maintenance of peace often fails to take decisions on many of the most equalissues. n eases where resolutions arc adopted they areoften ignored by the patties to the conflict. Again andagain Member States circumvent United Nations institutions or misuse them for their partisan interests. Despitethe great services title United Nations continues to provide and in spite of its great potential to contribute to humanprogress  we have to recognize that the system of multilateral diplomacy is in a serious state of crisis.23. The Secretary General  in his annual reporthas convincingly analysed this crisis and highlighted the grave danger emanating from it for the fateof mankind. His renewed urgent appeal for a collectiverecommitment to the principles of the Charter meets withGeneral Assembly.The United Nations is  after all  the onlyforum for the military powerless.Not yeast because of the role of Vienna as one ofthe United Nations  Austriafees a particular commitment to the objectives of theCharter end is prepared to make an active contributionto the strengthening of the United Nations as a trulyeffective instrument for peace  freedom and justice.

"9",437,"BDI",38,1983,"ï»¿245.	It is a great pleasure for my delegation to associate itself with previous speakers at this rostrum in congratulating Mr. Illueca on his election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. His moral and intellectual qualities  as well as his enormous experience as a diplomat and statesman  are earnests of the success of the work of our session. Furthermore  the fact that he comes from the developing world will  I am sure  leave its mark on our discussions of the problems currently preoccupying our countries.246.	My congratulations also go to the members of the General Committee who are assisting him. My country  one of the members  is proud to say that we shall endeavour conscientiously to help ensure the success of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.247.	Allow me also to thank the previous President  Mr. Imre Hollai  the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary  for the outstanding way in which he conducted the work of the last session of the General Assembly. He has left his own invaluable imprint upon the United Nations  this invaluable and irreplaceable international meeting-place.248.	My congratulations also go to the Secretary- General for his constant efforts since his election ^ safeguard and remain international peace and security  in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.249.	My Government's gratitude goes also to Mrs. Indira Gandhi  the Prime Minister of India and current Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement  for her addresses to the General Assembly and for the work she has been doing  with such outstanding courage and perseverance the Movement.250.	Lastly  may I take this opportunity to welcome to the community of nations Saint Christopher and Nevis  which has become the 158th Member of the United Nations. My delegation congratulates the people and Government of this new State on its independence and wishes them real success in their efforts to reconstruct and develop their nation.251.	The tradition has developed here at the United Nationsâand it is a good oneâof gathering each year to consider the state of the international community and to examine ways of dealing with the countless problems facing-it. The number and the level of the delegations present at this session reflect the interest and importance that all peoples attach to the work of the General Assembly. As far as my delegation is concerned  therefore  we have not come here just to make a  speech and then to depart. We are fully aware that each of us brings to this gathering of the international community message of hope  of concern  of anxiety and of solidarity from his people. It is essential that we all be heard  even if we are not understood.252.	The approach taken by the Republic of Burundi to the set of problems being considered at this session is fully in keeping with the hopes and aspirations set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. Peace  security and international co-operation are indeed at the forefront of its concerns. My country therefore reaffirms its determination to contribute to the attainment of the goals and objectives of the United Nations. Its ambition remains to be useful to the international community  confronted by various kinds of serious challenges at this period in the history of mankind.253.	Since the Organization was founded  the threats to peace and security have never been as serious as they are now. The Foreign Minister of Ireland quite rightly noted  that over the past 20 years no fewer than 65 local wars have taken place. Hotbeds of tension and confrontation continue to spread  involving enormous destruction in terms of human life and material damage. Should one not wonder  therefore  about the future of the Organization and of mankind?254.	The explosive situation in southern Africa gets only worse. The cause lies in the institutionalized system ofpracticed by the illegal racist Pretoria regime. This constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter and is a source of the instability affecting the whole sub- region. It is being perpetuated despite countless energetic condemnations by the United Nations. The South African Government's defiance of the international community is unprecedented and requires urgent appropriate steps if the credibility and future of the United Nations are not to be compromised.255.	The black people of South Africa continue to be deprived of dignity and freedom. They are at the mercy of the Pretoria regime  which is supported by certain Members of our Organization. This support reduces the timid sanctions decreed by the United Nations to total insignificance and ineffectiveness. My Government regrets that the essential measures that should have been taken against Pretoria have so far been blocked. Nothing could reasonably or morally justify such a state of affairs. It is high time that the Security Council applied the measures provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.256.	The General Assembly will have to speak out once again on the problem of Namibia also. Had it not been for the intransigence  bad faith  deceitfulness and political blindness of the Pretoria regime  that problem would already have been solved. Despite countless Security Council and General Assembly resolutions  the South African Government continues its illegal occupation of Namibia  thereby perpetuating the suffering of the Namibian people. The exploitation of the inhabitants and of the wealth of Namibiaâveritable plundering organized by Pretoria and its alliesâbodes ill for the populations concerned and for the region as a whole if  through a sudden surge of legitimacy  justice is not re-established.257.	Attempts to establish a link or a parallel between the independence of Namibia and any question alien to it  in particular the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola  are red herrings and should deceive no one. The question of Namibia is a problem of decolonization and should be dealt with as such. In keeping with the goals and objectives of the United Nations  the Government of the Republic of Burundi firmly supports the struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of SWAPO  and calls for implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) concerning the plan for the decolonization of Namibia258.	It is appropriate at this point to commend the Secretary-General for his efforts and for his courage and his determination to find a solution to the Namibian question. His journey to South Africa last August is undeniable proof of his devotion to the cause of international peace and to the independence of the people of Namibia.259.	My Government's total support for the countries of the region  victims of South Africa's military incursions and attempts at destabilization  requires no reiteration. The unacceptable occupation of part of Angola's territory by the racist Pretoria regime's forces of aggression must be of concern to the United Nations. It is essential that the international community once again demand respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola. It is paradoxical  to say the least  that those who are demanding the departure of Cuban troops from Angola never condemn the occupation of part of Angola's territory by South Africa. The opposition of the front-line countries to the system of apartheid and to the illegal occupation of Namibia could in no circumstances justify the terror that the South African Government is cynically sowing among the inhabitants of the neighbouring countries.260.	The southern part of Africa is not the only hotbed of tension in our continent. The situations in Western Sahara and Chad remain disturbing. My Government could not be silent about the fate of the Saharan and Chadian peoples.261.	No less than all other peoples  the Saharan people is entitled to self-determination. My Government condemns any manoeuvre to halt the process of self-determination for the Saharan people  under the leadership of POLISARIO. It considers that the resolution on the question of Western Sahara   adopted last June by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  must be implemented without further delay.262.	In Chad  a country ravaged by long years of war  the international community is witnessing the tragedy of a people dogged by death and destitution. The efforts undertaken by the OAU to restore unity and peace among Chadians have been paralyzed by internal or external plans that are totally unrelated to the interest of theChadian people  which aspires only to peace and development. The solution to this long-standing  complex question lies with the Chadians  and the Chadians alone. In the view of my Government and of friends of my country with which we have worked  this solution can be reached through respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Chad  through the cessation of hostilities in order to begin negotiations between the Chadians under the aegis of the OAU  through possible assistance from a neutral peace-keeping force after the departure of all foreign troops. Recent diplomatic developments provide grounds for hope that this approach is feasible  and all those who can contribute should act accordingly. That would be a great service to the people of Chad and to Africa.263.	The situation in Africa is not the only source of concern to my Government. In the Middle East the situation has never been as explosive. The worsening of the Palestinian problem and the conflagration in Lebanon are a serious threat to peace and security in the region and throughout the world. Thus the whole international community must set about resolving the problem in an urgent manner.264.	Once again we have evidence that until the Palestinian question has been resolved in a just and lasting fashion all States in the region will suffer. The refusal of the Israeli Government to recognize the Palestinian people's right to existence and self-determination and the denial of the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people constitute the major obstacles to any settlement of the conflict.265.	The Government of the Republic of Burundi has always recognized the State of Israel. However  it energetically condemns the constant recourse by Israel to aggression against neighbouring States. The purpose of that aggression is to satisfy Israel's expansionist ambitions and to attempt to liquidate the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. There can be no real peace as long as Israel's leaders remain unconvinced that they cannot reasonably aspire to tranquillity in a troubled region.266.	In this connection  the outstanding results of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held recently in Geneva  offer prospects which should be exploited. At a time when the PLO showed admirable open-mindedness  those Israelis who were in favour of peace reaffirmed their opposition to the Tel Aviv policy towards the Palestinian people and the Arab populations living in Israel. Sooner or later Israel must recognize the right of those 5 million people to freedom and to a homeland  just like other peoples of the world. It must find the will-power and the courage.267.	The Middle East is a troubled region  unfortunately  which is affected by more than one trouble- spot. Iran and Iraq are suffering as a result of the struggle between them  the consequences of which affect both parties. Everything has become fair in this particular war  which is threatening economies which had shown prospects of prosperity. It is time that war gave way to peace and that guns gave way to negotiations. My Government supports any initiative to halt the fighting and reconcile the two countries and we make an urgent appeal to the belligerents to end their destructive war.268.	In another part of the world  once again in Asia  and specifically in Korea  my Government's position has not changed. The solution of the Korean problem must be attained through a political settlement which  however  would be illusory without prior withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea. Burundi is and always will be in favour of initiatives to reunify the two Koreas. It could not endorse the arbitrary and unjust partition of the Korean people.269.	Outside interference continues to be a threat to the cohesion and indeed the existence of certain States. My Government pleads for a halt to such conduct  which is harmful to peace.270.	Stemming from this conviction  Burundi supports the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cyprus and respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-aligned status of that country.271.	My country asserts that all peoples threatened by division should have the chance for negotiation rather than be urged on to violence. This applies to Kampuchea  Afghanistan and Central America.272.	Tensions in Kampuchea and its environs can be resolved if there is respect for the principles of non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign States and the inadmissibility of the use of force to settle disputes. The withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea is necessary to facilitate the search for an overall political solution in the region.273.	The same applies to Afghanistan. The departure of foreign troops would greatly contribute to speeding up a political settlement of the question of Afghanistan. Indeed  respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan  as well as the principle of non-intervention  are the basis for any equitable settlement of a conflict that has gone on for too long. The efforts of the Secretary-General to achieve a political settlement of the question should be encouraged.274.	The situation in Central America is very disturbing. It can never be said too often that it is necessary to follow the path of dialogue rather than that of confrontation if there is to be any real solution to the problems of the region. Once again  the presence of foreign troops has aggravated a crisis and is disturbing the peaceful coexistence of the States in the region. The initiatives of the Contadora Group  composed of Colombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuela  should be encouraged and continued  since the war threatening Central America would benefit nobody.275.	My delegation will consider objectively the problems threatening peace and will subscribe to proposals which would meet the vital needs of the international community. The right of peoples to self-determination must be respected and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States should not be trampled underfoot by foreign interference.276.	To speak of peace and security in a world thirsting for armaments is a paradox. Never have arms build-ups proceeded at such a pace  with entire peoples looking on impassively. The published statistics are staggering: more than $600 billion a year devoted to military expenditure compared with less than $25 billion going to development assistance.277.	The international community is entitled to expect from the States concerned progress in negotiations on disarmament. The super-Powers should take a decision on the limitation of the nuclear danger and on progressive steps to exorcise it. Renunciation of the deployment of all new weapons would be a significant step forward.278.	The beneficial impact of disarmament on the economic development and social progress of the peoples of the entire world has been clearly shown over the years in countless debates on the question within the United Nations. Many voices  including those of authoritative speakers  to whom we pay a tribute  have once again proposed the diversion of part of the funds being spent on armaments to development  but it is time to move from words to action and to take initiatives and set examples in order to arouse the conscience of mankind.279.	As far as my Government is concerned  aside from the problems of peace and security  the development of three quarters of the human race remains the greatest challenge facing mankind. Given the gravity of the world economic situation which we are experiencing  the international community seems powerless. The special situation of developing countries has dramatically worsened  particularly that of the poorest nations which have awaited in vain the implementation of specific measures adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris in 1981. Furthermore  the weight of this debt has obliterated the hopes nurtured by certain southern countries for progress towards social and economic development for their peoples. The stagnation of international trade  the steady fall in commodity prices  the reductions in development assistance and the tendency to neglect and even denigrate multilateral economic co-operation are all negative factors likely to worsen the crisis. They can  however  be overcome providing there is the courage and political will to relaunch the global negotiations in keeping with resolution 34/138  adopted unanimously by the General Assembly four years ago.280.	My country believes that the international community must continue to pursue its efforts to bring about structural changes in the international economic and monetary systems. We believe that  given the interdependence of peoples  it is possible to create a new world economic order in which the interests of each country and each group are safeguarded. There is no doubt that  for example  instead of loans being made and then the repayments having to be rescheduled  in order not to worsen the debt burden  an increase in the price of commodities would partially relieve the crisis of external payments.281.	In this connection  it is worth recalling that during recent international gatherings dealing with economic questions the Group of 77 gave constant proof of suppleness and flexibility in its negotiations with the northern partners. The proposals in the Final Document of the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  entitled ""The Buenos Aires Platform"" "" helped lay the foundations for a thorough and effective co-operation. The Final Document undefined the need to adopt at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development a concerted  sustained programme for economic recovery and the promotion of the accelerated development of the member countries of the Group. Unfortunately  the industrialized countries chose to adopt rigid positions  and the sixth session did not produce satisfactory results.282.	The statement made here by the Prime Minister of India is of fundamental importance  because as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement she expressed the will of a hundred States which aspire to a world of dignity and prosperity  and which are prepared to negotiate. My delegation hopes that following this session a new step can be taken towards this noble objective  which is necessary for the survival of mankind.283.	One of the most important aspects of the new international economic order is the promotion of exchanges between developing countries. My Government firmly supports the conclusions reached at the Meeting at Buenos Aires and the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi earlier this year. Implementation of the Caracas Programme of Action remains a major requirement for the countries of the Group of 77 Subregional  regional and interregional co-operation must be strengthened  particularly in vital sectors such as food  energy  intermediate technology and scientific research.284.	In this respect  support from the international community is vital. I hope that our discussions on this important issue and on other matters that are so vital  such as the financing of science and technology and the code of conduct for multinational corporations  will produce the results that we are desperately waiting for.285.	The realisticâsome would say pessimisticâtone adopted by the Secretary-General in his annual report clearly suggests that  if the Member States  particularly the most powerful  do not strengthen their commitment to the attainment of the purposes of the Charter  the world will inevitably head towards ruin. We cannot allow the valuable heritage bequeathed to us by the founding fathers of the United Nations to disappear. The provisions of the Charter offer us the way to create a world where peace  justice  understanding and prosperity hold sway. Let us all work together systematically to bring that about. We shall thus discharge our greatest duty and realize the greatest dream of mankind."
"10",484,"BEL",38,1983,"203. While I regret that the hour is late  I should like to discuss in depth a few questions which I believe should be a matter of particular concern for the General Assembly.206.	The first among them  I think  is undoubtedly the question raised by the report submitted to the Assembly by the Secretary-General. Once again  he has had the courage to denounce  sincerely and straightforwardly  the weaknesses of the Organization and to suggest how they might be remedied.207.	The proliferation of crises  the constant deterioration of the international situation  and the aggravation of tensions  particularly between the super-Powers  and their impact on regional conflictsâwhich are becoming ever more frequent and ever more seriousâare all giving rise in every one of our countries to a growing malaise. Our populations are beginning to wonder with anxiety about what uncontrollable situation  what possibly irremediable catastrophe  we are leading them to. At the same time they cannot fail to notice that the machinery designed to restore peace and security is not working. Thus  public opinion in our countries is quite naturally asking  ""Why is the United Nations not taking action? What purpose does it serve?""208.	If we do not succeed in changing this situation  we shall have to be careful lest the growing disillusionment of our peoples turns from today's scepticism into indifference  or even hostility  towards international organizations in general and towards this Organization in the first place. The existence of the United Nations  founded as it is on the multilateral approach to international relations  is  however  becoming more and more indispensable.209.	Yet it is that approach which is now being called into question. Multilateralism is in a state of crisis  and the Secretary-General  in last year's report as well as in the one just submitted  has made a perfect diagnosis of the reasons why this is so.210.	This serious crisis  which could be fatal for international society  has manifested itself in many areas. In particular  it affects what is doneâor rather what is not doneâin one area to which we attach the highest priority: that of disarmament. In all branches of the Organization concerned with disarmamentâwhether the First Committee  the Disarmament Commission or  above all  the Committee on Disarmament at Genevaâ debates are marked by sterile confrontation  as a result of which each party finds itself back at the starting-point with nothingâor at most very littleâconcrete having been accomplished.211.	Certainly  there is no lack of proposals. But what is missing is a translation of those proposals into specific measures able to create that degree of mutual trust without which disarmament is really impossible. It is for this reason that Belgium attaches such importance to the possibility of verification of the conventions whose conclusion we are considering; the means of verification must become more stringent as the matter to be supervised becomes more important.212.	Last year's appeal by the Secretary-General met with the widest possible response  and this led to the unanimous adoption of resolution 37/67  whereby the General Assembly gave him its total support and invited him to continue his efforts towards strengthening the authority which the United Nations should be able to exercise.213.	At the thirty-seventh session  from this very rostrum  I referred to the importance which should be attached to the preventive role assigned by the Charter to the Security Council and to the Secretary- General.214.	The considerable activities undertaken by the Secretary-General throughout the past year and his determination to be present  either personally or through his closest colleagues  at the centre of all potential and existing conflicts are a demonstration of his determination actively to play his vital role and are an exhortation to States in their turn to shoulder their own responsibilities.215.	As for the Security Council  its President has summed up the present state of its work on this question. He has confirmed that the Charter provides the Organization with all the means necessary for carrying out its mandate. This  however  will be possible only to the extent that Member States  especially those to which the Charter entrusts a special share of those responsibilitiesâ the members of the Security Councilâare willing to make use of those means.216.	For its part  the Belgian Government supports all efforts and proposals aimed at strengthening the application of the principles laid down in the Charter which do not entail amendment or modification of that document. Specifically  we believe that the study of measures for the prevention of threats to the peace deserves priority attention. Preventive action should be taken essentially within the Security Council  for example through periodic meetings to review flash-points and tensions in the world  through regular reports by the Secretary-General on the situation  through fact-finding missions  and through strengthening the means by which the United Nations can act in cases of conflict. The Secretary-General himself has suggested this  in his speech at the Dag Hammarskjold Scholarship Fund luncheon on 15 September  in which he pleaded for a ""re-evaluation of United Nations peacekeeping"".217.	The suggestions I have just made are far from being exhaustive or exclusive. They are meant first of all to show that the Charter has provided the means necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security and that it contains a multitude of means and procedures which make it possible to achieve that fundamental purpose. My remarks are also intended to stress that this whole arsenal of means at our disposal is of no use if Member States do not have the determination and the sincere desire to have them put into effect and if they are not ready to subordinate national selfishness to the needs of the common interest. In this respect  special responsibility obviously lies with the most influential Members  and particularly with the permanent members of the Security Council.218.	The crisis of multilateralism has erupted on both the regional and the world levels. The former has become  to an increasing degree  an inevitable complement of the latter.219.	In realizing its calling for universality  the Organization has brought together an ever-growing number of States which do not constitute a homogeneous cultural unit. Quite the contrary  the traditions and values to which they are devoted offer quite varied shades of opinion that are sometimes quite considerable. Hence  the difficulty for the Organization to define  in many respects  what a French scholar recently called ""a universal law which each can recognize because each recognizes himself in it"".220.	It is in this perspective that Belgium has several times suggested from this rostrumâas it did last yearâ that the United Nations might adopt a regional approach in such areas as disarmament  the promotion of human rights or in the economic field  and that this be done  if necessary  in co-operation with the multilateral institutions of the regions concerned.221.	We must restore the spirit of multilateralism to its full vigour at both the world and regional levels and; thereby ensure a close connection between them.222.	With regard to the region to which my country belongs  I would favour the European Communities' taking this course. Having overcome the crisis with which they are confronted and which their member States are facing at this very moment  they could for the benefit of all play a larger part in solving the world crisis that weighs on all our economies and create conditions enabling the North-South dialogue to be pursued in a more determined manner than hitherto.223.	In the same spirit I wish to stress the great importance Belgium attaches to the negotiations at Vienna on mutual and balanced reduction of armed forces in central Europe  as well as the Conference on Confidence- and; Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe that will soon be convened  first at Helsinki and later at Stockholm.224.	It goes without saying that the Geneva negotiations  whether on Euromissiles or on strategic arms  although held within a different context  are also the focus and concern of my Government  affecting as they do the very existence of our peoples.225.	In the context of this regional concern I have just touched upon  my country attaches an equal importance to developments in the various regions of the world. The African continent nevertheless commands in Belgium a particular  if not exclusive  attention. That is why last February the Belgian Government approved a fairly lengthy document that attempted to define as systematically  coherently and exhaustively as possible the objectives  principles and means of implementing policies my country wishes to pursue with regard to Africa.226.	Among the guiding principles of Belgium's proposed African policy  I should like to mention the following:""Belgium genuinely wishes to forestall anything that could contribute to the division and weakening of the African continent. . . This means that it must try to promote inter-African co-operation and that it must conduct an active policy  not only towards Africa as a whole  but also towards inter-African organizations  whether they be continental or regional or whether they cover economic  political  cultural or other areas.""The same document goes on to state in particular  with regard to the OAU:""We cannot . . .but acknowledge that it has played a positive and undoubtedly irreplaceable role for the African continent... If the Organization of African Unity were to disappear or become powerless because of the crisis affecting it today  that would represent a severe blow for each country belonging to it and for the whole of Africa.""227.	Thus  my country has followed with genuine anxiety the crises that have affected the activities of that organization to the extent that on two occasions they have actually prevented it from convening its summit meeting  thereby appearing to threaten its very existence. It was with genuine satisfaction that Belgium saw the heads of State and Government overcome the conflicts and differences of opinion among themselves and meet last June at Addis Ababa in an attempt to make negotiation prevail over confrontation.228.	The tragedy Chad is experiencing today and the terrible problem that crisis is inflicting upon the OAU demonstrate how difficult it remains to achieve this goal.229.	Belgium profoundly believes that the best way to solve disputes between African nations lies in their cooperation within the OAU  and we hope that that organization will be able to meet the challenge and to obtain the agreement of all its members to respect the legitimacy  that is to say  the African legitimacy  of its decisions.230.	One of the principal dramas in the world today is that lived daily by thousands of refugees throughout the world. Together with other regionsâsuch as South-East AsiaâAfrica  where ethnic groups often spill across borders  is especially affected by this plague. The flow of refugees and the displacement of populations are particularly acute problems in Africa. Such movement endangers the economic and social structures of many States. It also frequently disrupts good-neighbourly relations between countries.231.	The first International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  held in 1980  made it possible to undertake a preliminary studyâobviously incompleteâ of all aspects of this vast problem. The second conference  to be held next July at Geneva  should provide an opportunity to go beyond emergency planning and mere survival and to conceive lasting solutions.232.	This is yet another area in which the regional and subregional approach is of particular value  because it makes it possible to take into account the specific nature of problems that do not occur in the same guise in all parts of the world. In Africa  for example  refugees do not as a rule wander beyond the territory neighbouring their home country.233.	Hence  co-operation among neighbouring countries is the best way to create conditions for a satisfactory and long-term settlement of the problem  either through repatriation to the home country or through integration into the host country. In this respect  development projects designee to strengthen the infrastructure of host countries are of particular importance.234.	We believe that the second conference could provide an opportunity for the African Governments  regional and subregional African organizations and international organizations involved  as well as for the countries granting aid  to revise their assistance programmes in order better to include the integration of refugees and their participation in the economies of host countries within the overall framework of development plans.235.	Belgium  for its part  is willing to participate actively in the Conference and in the follow-up it entails  either directly or through the European Communities whose action in this respect may easily find a solid basis in the Lome Convention and within the specific guidelines for co-operation with third world countries not associated with the Communities.236.	Finally  the situation in southern Africa remains a serious source of disorder in our already much trembled world.237.	Whether the problem is Namibia  the questions raised by the policy of separate developmentâthat is  apartheid âof South Africa  or the development of the situation in what are known as the front-line States  we find ourselves faced with various elements of the same problem  which must be settled as soon as possible.238.	Belgium  whose active participation in the United Nations Council for Namibia demonstrates how seriously it takes this problem  nevertheless does not claim to be able to suggest from this rostrum even a partial solution. None the less  my country appeals to South Africa  that African country recognized as such in the continent  at last to respond to the appeal made to it in Lusaka more than 15 years ago and to have faith in the generosity which is one of the main characteristics of the African people and which prompted the great poet Leopold Sedar Senghor to say: ""Those peoples of fire  when they have freed their hands  have inscribed fraternity on the first page of their history"".239.	At the same time  my country intends to increase its aid to the States of southern Africa  particularly through the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference  as a contribution to their harmonious development.240.	Belgiumâfor its own part and with its nine partners in the European Communitiesâwill contribute  if that is the desire of the countries and inter-State organizations of the continent  to the development of an African continent that is genuinely African  free and stable. That means an Africa that has found its own answers to its own problems and thus freed itself from extraneous ideological or political struggles for influence; an Africa which has overcome the aftermath of colonization of which the former colonizers retain no memory  so that their future relations may be free of all ambiguities; an Africa sufficiently stable  internally and regionally  to prevent or limit civil conflicts and conflicts between States.241.	It is a fact that the necessity for Belgium to pursue an African policy worthy of the name cannot be and indeed is not independent of our relations with the countries of the so-called third world as a whole. Certainly Africa is closer to us in terms of geography  history and our knowledge of it. But Africa is only one part of the world  and Belgium must remain open to the entire world  and as far as development co-operation is concerned it must be able to respond also as far as possible to appeals from countries in other continents.242.	Our policy must take account of all our relations with all the countries of the South. In spite of their different situations and their sometimes divergent interests  those countries are united in a vast movement of political solidarity  in a group that exerts economic pressure on the more developed countries and  finally  in diplomatic negotiating power. We cannot ignore this fact. What we rightly or wrongly call the North-South dialogue  regardless of its vicissitudes and implications  will remain for a long time to come one of the elements of international political and economic relations.243.	In the meantime  a certain number of difficult problems which weigh heavily on national economies are of world-wide dimensions  such as the problems of a secure food supply  of energy  of prices of the most important raw materials for third world countries and of indebtedness  which has assumed such great proportions.244.	Bilateral relations between Western and developing countries alone can provide but partial solutions to those problems. They must therefore be considered and negotiated at world level  which is where they arise.245.	That is why Belgium  together with its European partners  responded positively to the idea launched at the United Nations of holding global negotiations: Various fields of international co-operation. That is why Belgium still hopes that a basis of agreement can be found for launching those negotiations  on conditionâas foreseen by the United Nationsâthat this exercise takes place in a spirit of common interest  mutual advantage and responsibility on the part of all the parties.246.	In this respect  the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade last June  was the major event in the North- South dialogue in the past year. Of course  it did not succeed in achieving all its ambitious objectives. Nevertheless  there was agreement on certain points. Limited though they were  those results should encourage us to continue the dialogue  especially at a time when signs of improvement in the world economic situation seem to be emerging. Belgium is convinced that the combined effort of all the competent international organizations and all participating States should make it possible to achieve at least a certain number of concrete results: the stabilization of markets and export earnings for primary products  the preservation of an open international trade system  the restoration of a stable monetary and financial system and  finally  the maintenance of and if possible an increase in official aid and bank loans.247.	This is the only possible way for us to take common action to ensure balanced world economic development  which is an essential guarantee of peace and understanding among nations.248.	The picture of the international situation which I have felt compelled to sketch is  unfortunately  not a cheerful one. Nevertheless  one positive event that gives rise to real hope has left its mark on the past year and deserves to be highlighted. I mean the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which took place at New Delhi last March. The basic principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which are fully in keeping with the ideals of peace of the United Nations  were given new life there. The non- aligned countries have spared no effort in attempting to resolve their disputes by peaceful means and to draw up common proposals to meet the unprecedented challenge of the global economic crisis. My country welcomes the response to this summit meeting throughout the world and wishes to convey to its president  the Prime Minister of India  the great interest and sympathy that not only the conclusions of the Conference but also the very important statements which she personally made on that occasion have aroused in Belgium. Faithful to its own ideals  which have existed since its creation and which were laid down by its founding fathers  Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Nehru  India and its Prime Minister have gone back to the sources of true non-alignment  thus enhancing the prestige of the Movement.249.	Another event which could also have been a ray of sunshine through the clouds of the troubled international situation we are now witnessing was the closure at the beginning of this month of the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Co-operation and Security in Europe. The meeting was held in circumstances made extremely difficult by the continuance and even intensification of the Soviet armed intervention in Afghanistan  which we condemn  and by the course of events in Poland  where it has not yet been possible to bring about the national consensus which alone can enable all the spiritual and social forces of the country to participate in its rebuilding in an appropriate climate of freedom. Nevertheless  after three years of debate the participating States found it possible to agree on a concluding document which  although it contains serious flaws which my country deplores  particularly in the human rights Held  can be considered sufficiently substantial and balanced.250 Other meetings are to follow with a view to restoring in East-West relations a climate propitious to understanding  moderation  willingness to respect regional and world equilibrium  and a desire to make serious progression controlling  reducing and stopping armaments  without which peace is under constant threat.251.	The 35 countries concerned should  therefore  have every reason to celebrate with some satisfaction the end of their work at Madrid  had it not been darkened by an unspeakable act  that of the shooting down in cold blood  by a Soviet military aircraft  of a civilian airliner of the Korean Air Lines  carrying 269 passengers  men  women and children. Today there is very ready condemnation  at least in words  of the first use of force. If there is a case in which it would have been possible to live up to such a commitment  not only in words but also in deeds  it was precisely that of the 269 unarmed civilians brutally shot down by a blind force which knows that its weapons cannot be resisted. In another forum  efforts are being made to devise new measures to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again. It must be hoped that such measure will in fact be applied. I cannot confine myself to merely condemning from this rostrum an act which cost the lives of 269 innocent people. I also vigorously deplore the blow dealt by this act to international confidence  without which detente and peace are impossible. I wish to reiterate the sincerest condolences of the Belgian Government to the Government of the Republic of Korea  a friendly Government whose tireless efforts to bring about a peaceful and democratic reunification of the Korean peninsula  as well as the reuniting of families divided for more than 30 years now by the Korean tragedy  we very much appreciate.252.	Never has the need for a stable and secure organization of international society been so keenly felt  and never has a more turbulent world made it more difficult to achieve this goal. If  like Paul Valery  we take a look at the world today  we can really only find grounds for frustration and anxiety. It is enough to pronounce names such as Middle East  Lebanon  Iran and Iraq  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Horn of Africa  Chad  southern Africa  Central America  Chile  Cyprusâand others which I am not even mentioningâto appreciate the number of conflicts which today bedevil relations between States.253.	Here and there  brave men and nations are trying to work out the elements of a peaceful solution. In this respect  I would like to salute the efforts of the Contadora Group and also to express the hope that national reconciliation will make it possible for Lebanon  through its legitimate Government  to bring about a national reconciliation  which would allow that country  finally freed from foreign occupation  to enjoy the peace which it so very much wants.254.	I would also like to repeat Belgium's profound conviction that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without recognition of the existence and security of all States in the region  including Israel  and the legitimate aspirations of all its peoples  particularly the Palestinian people.255.	I belong to that generation which witnessed the birth of the nuclear age  which is the anxious if not horrified witness of its proliferation and which has never really adjusted to the idea of living with the fear caused by its existence. I am among those who are struggling forthe control and reduction of these terrible arms of destruction. However  almost 40 years of experience have ' taught me a certain number of facts. Nuclear power and the weapons to which it gave birth are a product of the human genius. Those who  like me  have gone through the experience of what was once called the race for the first bomb between the Allies and the Nazis  will never forget it; what was at stake in that race was the very survival of our free world. One can aspire  as I myself do  together with so many other men of goodwill and peace  to the elimination of the atomic weapon  and indeed all other means of destruction. However  one must be aware  as I am  that such elimination is not possible. Indeed  history teaches us that all scientific and technological progress can be simultaneously detrimental and beneficial  but that it is always irreversible. What we must do and what we can do is to create conditions whereby only the beneficial aspects of progress can be developed.256.	Humanity is constantly endangered by tensions born of egoism  jealousy  narrow nationalism  violations of fundamental human rights  and rejection of an international order based on the rule of law. The real problems lie in underdevelopment  hunger and inhuman conditions  for which a final solution must be found.257.	Only the creation of an international legal order can provide the framework within which tensions will dissipate  conditions for control  limitation and reduction of armaments will be created  and creative forces will emerge which will help us overcome the crisis of our times. The achievement of such an order depends on us alone  and in particular on the Organization. Let us have the courage to denounce those forces which are opposed to this and let us undertake to contribute to the building of that order. This is a commitment which Belgium solemnly enters into here and now."
"11",530,"BEN",38,1983,"ï»¿24.	 Once again representatives of the international community are meeting here  as they do every year. They have come in great numbers to New York to plead the cause of peace  security and cooperation among nations.25.	Mr. President  you have the difficult and important task of presiding over the debates of this session of the General Assembly and guiding the activities of this important body throughout the coming year. The People's Republic of Benin takes pleasure in greeting you as a great friend. We offer you our full congratulations and must say how happy we are at your well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session. You represent a country that is proud of its traditions and of the noble ideals of Bolivar  a country with which the People's Republic of Benin has friendly relations that are steadily developing further. Your considerable experience within the United Nations system  your ability  and your determination and patience in the search for truth and for solutions to crises are qualities that we in Benin are familiar with  and we feel that these qualities guarantee that our work will be successful under your far-sighted guidance. 26.	Our delegation wishes to express its appreciation also to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary  for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the work of the thirty- seventh session and for his active and influential participation in the solution of many of the problems that have faced the international community during the past 12 months.27.	We also address our congratulations to the other members of the General Committee  who will be helping you in your difficult task. The delegation of Benin assures you all of its full cooperation.28.	Lastly  we wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General for his excellent report on the work of the Organization	which demonstrates his great qualities of courage  frankness and far-sightedness. We feel that he is someone we can turn to throughout this session as we do our work. We congratulate him most warmly on his laudable efforts and initiatives in the cause of the noble ideals of the Charter  and we reaffirm our unreserved support for him in his difficult task.29.	We take this opportunity to congratulate most warmly Saint Christopher and Nevis  the newest Member of this great family of the United Nations.30.	The picture of the world today is indeed a terrifying one  a source of shame to those who would like to behave that mankind is mature  united and responsible. As we analyse the international situation  we can see that the picture is on all levels even bleaker and more disturbing in it was a year ago.31.	We note with some bitterness that the appeal to mankind for solidarity launched from this rostrum in the general debate at the last session did not lead to the establishment of codes of conduct and examples of systematic and universal application thereof. Interdependence  which affects us equally and is increasingly felt  has not really led to an awareness of the solidarity among nations; far from it. The sacrifices that are required in the name of solidarity will be made only grudgingly or not at all  as the experience of this last year of international affairs has shown us  and it has been a bitter and distressing illustration of that.32.	However  the interdependence of continents and peoples is made imperative by modern industrial civilization  and it should logically leadâand we can only hope that it willâto broad areas of agreement and direct negotiations between the various regions of our planet  in the interest of a just and equitable distribution of the fruits of general economic growth. However  instead of the heights of understanding and fraternity  our world today  on the eve of the third millennium  offers us the spectacle of desolation  chaos and economic warfare.33.	The inability of many to see the world economy as a single  coherent whole requiring integrated approaches which  going beyond interdependence  are based on solidarity  means that today we are in a situation of worldwide imbalance which  if we are not careful  will lead to an unprecedented catastrophe and disintegration. We are living through an age of crisis  which has assumed increasingly alarming proportions over the past few years. The growth rate of the world economic output  which was only 1.2 per cent in 1980  fell spectacularly and stabilized at a much lower level in 1982. In the developed countries  where makeshift methods were still being used to ease or offset the more obvious effects of the crisis  there is now an awareness of a sad fact that the situation is even worse than it was during the Great Depression. More than 10 per cent of the able-bodied population is now doomed to unemployment.34.	In the area of international trade  the difficulties encountered are enormous and almost insurmountable because of defensive protectionist and short-term monetary policies which the developed countries are using in hopes of checking inflation. The self-preservation reflex which some developed countries seem to be rediscovering adds to the general confusion and aggravates the difficulties inherent in managing the economic crisis  the most obvious contradictions and the most pernicious effects of which are felt in a particularly acute manner by the fragile and precarious economies of the developing countries. The impoverishment of these countries is becoming increasingly obvious. Indeed  over the last two years major losses in foreign currency have been noted  due to a decrease in export earnings and following the catastrophic drop in the prices of commodities which  in real terms  are today no higher than they were during the 1930s. That massive reduction in available foreign exchange for the year 1982 is estimated at $200 billion despite compensatory measures.35.	The economic crisis  by its devastating impact and debilitating effects  wipes out all that has been achieved and jeopardizes the growth of third world countries. The growth rate of the developing countries fell from 2.9 per cent in 1980 to 0.6 per cent in 1981. The per capita income of many of those countries  particularly the least advanced  has fallen in a disturbing manner. At the end of 1981  the reserves of the developing countries amounted to barely $100 billion  just enough to finance exports for two months  or for only one month in the particular case of Africa.36.	And yet the debt burden of those countries has increased sharply  reaching $540 billion  including the debt-servicing burden  which is as high as $106 billion per year. Thai situation  paralysing in itself  is further aggravated by the recent and current phenomenon of the rise in the dollar  whose extreme over-evaluation continues most seriously to hamper the ability of the developing countries to repay their debts and thus stifles their economies. The rise in the dollar rate increases and  in fact  multiplies the burden of debt-servicing and emphasizes the extent to which the structural and functional machinery of those countries is dependent on the major financial and industrial centers. Similarly  the balance- of-payments deficit of the countries suffering from this iniquitous situation has risen to $62 billion in 1982 and is expected to be even worse in 1983.37.	Those factors and many others have forced many developing countries to delay repayment of their loans and to request a rescheduling of their debts  the repayment of which has been made particularly difficult because of the restrictions imposed by the credit institutions of the rich countries  which do not seem particularly willing to seek satisfactory  integrated solutions to the serious economic problems of our world.38.	In these circumstances  one can appreciate the scope of the constructive measures proposed by the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries for holding global negotiations  the principle of which had been accepted at the Versailles Economic Summit of the seven industrialized countries of the Western world in June 1982. But the intransigence and the lack of any sincere desire to co-operate on the part of the latter soon cast those proposals into limbo  and they have now been locked up in the museum of measures that are left to rot away over time.39.	Despite that rejection and the lack of understanding shown by the family of the industrialized countries  the third world  which includes the majority of non-aligned countries  is intensifying its initiatives and opportunities for holding meetings to reach agreement. For example  there has been the proposal to hold a conference to resolve the problems arising from the situation of the developing countries  and that was accepted in principle during the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. There were also proposals put forward by the Group of 77 in July 1982. All those suggestions  initiatives and proposals are evidence that the third world is always willing to co-operate and hopes that the awareness of the common dangers that haunt us all  rich or poor  small or large  will lead us to open the way to frank and genuine cooperation.40.	Is it not indeed unfortunate that today  when the concept of the post-industrial era is emerging from the distant fog and becoming a reality  the least advanced countries should still be vegetating under unacceptable living conditions and that the problems of food supplies  stabilization of commodity prices and energy resources should still be matters of such serious concern? There is time for the industrialized world to react and at last to show that it is willing to take action to help us out of the crisis by putting an end to the selfish protectionism which is so rife today  thus preventing mankind from sinking forever into social decay and from becoming completely dehumanized  a process already under way on a large scale in the existence and perseverance of apartheid racism  Zionism and the sinister and cynical arms race.41.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Benin believes that urgent and radical measures are required to set up new international structures that would precisely prevent the international economy from drifting with the tide of current events. In today's reality of economic power relationships  the individual act of rebellion  the personal commitment or the commitment of a few to break away from the existing evil order  the words spoken by the just are quickly crushed and cruelly trampled upon. This sad realization strengthens the need for unified and coherent action on the part of all countries of the world  particularly the third world countries  whose fate is being decided in the urban centers of the industrialized countries by the transnational corporations.42.	Let us look at what happened to the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which met at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983. Par us  the developing and non-aligned countries  that session presented a special opportunity to review fully and comprehensively the international economic situation and its impact on trade and development  particularly that of the least advanced countries. It was to consider the ramifications of the present crisis in the world economy  which is a manifestation of the structural imbalances of the system  and it was to focus its attention on the urgent need for a recovery of that economy  emphasizing a reactivation of the development process in the third world countries. It was to debate the major international economic problems  and against this background it was to take a position on appropriate measures to get under way a programme for world economic recovery  for growth and sustained development  including measures of structural reform of the world economy.43.	However  contrary to the expectations of the developing countries  the recent meeting at Belgrade came up against the icy intransigence of the rich countries  which meant that the Conference was unable to work out specific proposals that could ensure the desired management of the world economy. The high hopes of the developing countries were dashed because consideration of the implementation of the Substantial New Programme ofAction for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries was sabotaged and did not take place.44.	Despite the repeated appeals of the preparatory meetings held at Baghdad  Libreville  Carthage and Buenos Aires  and addressed particularly to the developed countries  to take maximum advantage of the opportunity of the Belgrade meeting to translate into major political decisions a new spirit of multilateral cooperation  the hopes of the international community were dashed because of the systematic abstention of the rich countries  which refused to co-operate constructively. Thus the problem of the monetary and financial system  which is one of the major areas in which improved international cooperation is necessary  is still in an impasse. The present system continues to be unable to react at the level necessary for a recovery of the world economy and a resumption of development in the least developed countries because of inter alia the short-term and introverted policies of certain developed countries  which are constantly  educing international financial cash flows. The deficit countries still do not have any special weighting in the allocation of special drawing rights.45.	The trade problems of developing countries are further worsened because of the increasingly complex protectionist policies and measures of the developed countries. The proliferation of so-called self-imposed restriction and rationalization measures in trade  and recourse to the arbitrary and unjustified application of compensatory rights  are constantly having a negative impact on the production and export prospects in sectors in which the developing countries were beginning to acquire a relative advantage.46.	In sum  the Belgrade session  like earlier sessions  yielded only meagre results. It did not come up with a clear and unambiguous commitment by the developed countries to eschew protectionism.47.	In this setting of unequal and unfair economic warfare our country  the People's Republic of Benin  like all developing countries  particularly those which  like Benin  are least developed  is seriously damaged by this imbalance and uncertainty  which weigh heavily on our fragile economy in this world crisis. In addition to this general situation  we have had climatic problems  such as the drought of 1981 and the floods of  1982  whose impact  particularly on our agricultural sector  caused major reductions in agro-pastoral food and industrial production. The result has been the loss of almost one third of our export earnings.48.	Faced with this situation  the People's Republic of Benin has adopted measures for restructuring the vital sectors of its national economy. A round-table conference of the partners in the economic and social development of Benin was organized in March 1983. Representatives of many friendly countries and international agencies attended this important meeting. We should like to express to them once again our gratitude for the active part they took in our discussions and for the commitments they entered into on behalf of their countries or agencies. We take this opportunity to appeal from this rostrum to all those countries and international organizations and agencies  partners in the economic and social development of Benin  to ensure that the commitments entered into are honoured within the time limits dictated by the erosive action of inflation.49.	The Security Council  in resolution 419 (1977)  called on all States and all appropriate international agencies  including the United Nations and its specialized agencies  to provide economic assistance to Benin. In December 1980 the General Assembly  in resolution 35/88  recommended further assistance in the drawing up of a programme for special economic assistance to Beninâa programme which was endorsed by the General Assembly in 1981 and in 1982. A performance report on this assistance programme will be submitted to the thirty-ninth session. Meanwhile  an interim report has been prepared which shows that despite the real efforts made  there is still much to be done to mobilize the funds required to implement the major projects included in this programme of special economic assistance. It is our hope that through our efforts  together with those of friendly countries and international agencies  we shall be able next year to report to the Assembly the achievement of the objectives of this programme.50.	All developing countries are deeply concerned by the economic problems that I have been describing  and particularly by the state of complete impoverishment in which they are kept by the present international economic order. They are also fully aware of all the political crises created and cynically maintained throughout the world by international imperialism simply to maintain and strengthen that most evil and exploitative system.51.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Benin is deeply concerned over the current situation in southern Africa  which can be explained only by the fact that certain Powers  through their constantly increasing support for the Pretoria regime  are deliberately undermining the efforts of the Organization of African Unity  and the United Nations to seek a just solution to the problems of that region of the African continent.52.	The key to the problem of Namibia and of apartheid has been removed by Powers which are friendly to racist South America. How else can it be explained that over the years the South African regime  far from negotiating resolutely to promote Namibian independence  has been persisting in its blind repression of the Namibian people and piling delaying tactic upon delaying tactic? How else can it be explained that in spite of the repeated appeals of the international community South Africa has been able to put forward as solutions to the dehumanising problem of apartheid only violence  bantustanization and the continued cowardly assassinations of militants of the African National Congress (ANC)?53.	The continuing occupation of Namibia  the harassment of neighbouring African States  the demeaning and inhuman practice of apartheid  and the intransigence  stubbornness and systematic use of large-scale and unheard-of violence by the despised Pretoria regime are an affront and an insult to the conscience of every civilized human being  and a challenge to the international community.54.	The People's Republic of Benin has always supported and will always support the Namibian people  led by its vanguard  the South West Africa People's Organization	in all its tribulations until the achievement of complete victory and of an independence free from political or territorial restrictions. We reject out of hand all the delaying and diversionary tactics attempting to link Namibia's independence with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.55.	At this session the Assembly must consider and adopt special emergency measures to give effect to Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to ensure that that martyred people can accede without further delay to full independence.56.	The People's Republic of Benin will continue to lend its unreserved support to the courageous struggle of the South African fighters for the final eradication of apartheid and for the establishment of democracy  equality and social justice. The delegation of Benin pays a respectful tribute to the memory of the three ANC militants who were cravenly murdered by the Pretoria regime on 9 June 1983. We urge all South African patriots to continue the struggle with yet greater determination to immortalize the memory of those heroes and of so many other martyrs killed in battle or ignominiously and cold-bloodedly struck down by the torturers of that hell which has been cursed by the entire human race.57.	Our delegation regrets that the recent Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination did not live up to the enormous hopes placed in it by the oppressed peoples of South Africa and Namibia.58.	We remain convinced  and we reaffirm  that only the adoption and application of comprehensive economic sanctions against the arrogant Pretoria regime will force it into line with the requirements of human reason. Accordingly  we oppose the abuse of the veto to prevent mankind from ridding itself of this pestilence  this gangrene eating away the lives of tens of millions of human beings.59.	Our delegation is deeply concerned also about the tragedy of the Chadian people  which is the result of the attempts of international imperialism to impose one single political and military faction over all the others  in spite of the fact that the 1979 Lagos Accord on National Reconciliation in Chad called for the establishment of the Transitional National Union Government and opened up more hopeful prospects for Chad. Blinded by its sordid scheme  imperialism refuses to see that the situation in that country is one of civil warâa civil war which is not a recent one and whose progress has been observed by all.60.	For its part  the People's Republic of Benin reaffirms that the events in Chad are strictly internal events. Accordingly  we condemn all foreign intervention in Chad  for such intervention only exacerbates the difficulties and the suffering of the Chadian people. We are convinced that no military solution can ever resolve the problem of Chad; what is required is reconciliation among all the people of Chad. For these reasons  the delegation of the People's Republic of Benin proposes for the settlement of this fratricidal conflict: first  the preservation of the de facto ceasefire in the field through its immediate confirmation and ironclad guarantees; secondly  the withdrawal of all foreign troops; thirdly  non-intervention in the internal affairs of Chad; and fourthly  national reconciliation under the auspices of the OAU.61.	The People's Republic of Benin accordingly supports the efforts of the current Chairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  our brother Mengistu Haile- Mariam  to restore peace and to bring about national reconciliation in Chad  and to this end we urge all our brethren in Chad to create conditions in which they can all set off down the path of peace and reconciliation and tackle the basic task of rebuilding their country  rather than getting bogged down forever in vain attempts to impose the legitimacy of a given Chad Government  a legitimacy which lies within the exclusive sovereign gift of the people of Chad.62.	We wish to express our concern and anxiety about the situation in Western Sahara. The continuing deterioration of that situation is a threat to peace and security  which are essential to the peoples of the North African region for the pursuit of their efforts for independent and viable economic and social development. The People's Republic of Benin welcomes the resolution on this question  adopted at the nineteenth session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government  held at Addis Ababa in June 1983. That resolution called for direct negotiations between the Kingdom of Morocco and POLISARIO ' for a cease-fire and for the organization among the people of Western Sahara of a referendum on self-determination before the end of December 1983 [we  4/33/37.2].63.	My country welcomes the favourable reception given this resolution by all the peoples and countries that love peace  justice and freedom  and we deplore the delaying tactics so actively pursued since then to prevent its implementation. In renewing its unvarying support for the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic  the Saharan people and its vanguard  POLISARIO  in their struggle to implement that OAU resolution  the People's Republic of Benin calls upon the entire international community  particularly the United Nations Secretary-General  to exert effective pressure and to use all their influence to ensure the immediate holding of the referendum on self-determination under the auspices of the OAU and with the cooperation of the United Nations.64.	The deterioration in the situation in the Middle East and the increase in tension there lead us once more to sound the alarm. We must say that  far from improving since last year  the situation has recently suffered a dangerous deterioration. The Organization must take note of the seriousness of the Zionist escalation and find ways and means during this session to make Israel understand the risks to peace and security it is creating in that region.65.	The People's Republic of Benin condemns the Zionist policy of aggression  genocide and massacre directed against the Arab populations of the region  and we support the struggle of the Palestinian people and its right to have its own homeland and to establish a sovereign  independent State. We reaffirm our political and diplomatic support for the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole representative of the oppressed people of Palestine.66.	Solving the Palestinian problem requires a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the conflict in the Middle East  a settlement based on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. The PLO must participate on a footing of complete equality in all efforts made by the United Nations to find the long-awaited solution to the problem of the Middle East.67.	As convinced and consistent supporters of the Arab cause in the Middle East  the People's Republic of Benin  its party  the People's Revolutionary Party of Benin  and its Government  the National Executive Council  condemn the new form of plots using increased pressure and corruption to strengthen the diplomatic position of the Tel Aviv leaders by re-establishing untimely and unnatural diplomatic relations with the Zionist entity despite its continuing military occupation of the Arab territories it holds as the result of war and despite its stubbornness in opposing the exercise of the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination and to its own State.68.	The very proper decision of the African States  freely taken  to break off relations with the Zionist State is still valid and must be scrupulously observed in the present situation in the Middle East  which is worse and more disturbing now than it was in 1973. We consider that to resume diplomatic relations with Israel  when there has been no real objective improvement in the situation since the Camp David agreements  which are simply another plot against the Palestinian cause even if some Governments do find them useful  amounts to defending the interests of Israel and international imperialism. It would mean deliberately working against the noble cause of the Palestinian people  working against peace in the Middle East  and undermining  indeed destroying  the Afro-Arab solidarity which is essential for the success of our common struggle against injustice  colonialism and underdevelopment.69.	The conflict which has been going on for more than three years now between Iran and Iraq  two brother countries united by age-old ties  is a matter of serious concern to us. My country once again makes a solemn appeal to those two countries  whose quarrel is furthering the Machiavellian purposes of international imperialism  to begin negotiations to reach a just and lasting peace to the honour of the peoples of Iran and Iraq. The prestige and credibility of this Organization require it to do everything in its power to help in the realization of that goal.70.	The persistence of old hotbeds of tension and the appearance of new ones  and the signs that the existing structures for peace-keeping and the maintenance of peace and stability are becoming worn out  inevitably lead us to the sad conclusionâbut without destroying our hopes for the futureâthat the prerequisites for peace are still absent both in Africa and in the Middle East. How can it be otherwise  when some countries still cling to old  outdated systems of domination and dependence and are making stubborn efforts to prevent by all means possible the countries of these regions from exercising their right to self-determination and independence and from taking the measures that they consider necessary to overcome underdevelopment and abject poverty?71.	The general picture in the rest of the world is similar. In Asia  America and the Caribbean the peoples are asking themselves anxiously what they can do when faced with predatory and destabilizing manoeuvres which  in the final analysis  mark international imperialism's traditional desire for hegemonistic domination.72.	In Asia  the prevailing situation of neither war nor peace  the collusion of imperialism with quasi-dictatorial regimes  the strategic military manoeuvres  the establishment of	military alliances  the determination to whip up bellicose feelings among certain peoplesâall this seriously threatens peace and the security of the peoples of that continent.73.	The People's Republic of Benin recognizes and supports  and will so continue  the sovereign right of each State to have its own policy and its own point of view. We firmly believe that no nation  large or small  has the right to interfere and become involved in the internal affairs of another country or to try to impose on another country its views or a course of conduct other than the one that that country has chosen for itself.74.	Accordingly  our delegation reaffirms that the peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan are and will remain masters of their own fate  free to choose the socio-political system they wish. We condemn any intervention in the internal affairs of those two countries  and appropriate measures should be examined and taken to eliminate foreign occupation and the threats to their security. The People's Republic of Benin  which favours removing from those regions the tension that has prevailed for years  feels that peace and the guarantee of peace are possible only if there is a political solution through dialogue and direct negotiations without any preconditions. That is why we reiterate our full support for the declaration of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries on the questions of Kampuchea and Afghanistan 75.	The People's Republic of Benin also stands shoulder to shoulder with the People's Democratic Republic of Korea in its tireless struggle for the peaceful  independent and democratic reunification of the country and the establishment of the Confederal Republic of Korea. We repeat that only the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the peninsula will make possible a definite and viable solution of the Korean crisis.76.	We also repeat our support for and militant solidarity with the people of Cyprus. We renew our tireless support for the just cause of the people of East Timor. In Central America and the Caribbean  the struggles for peace  freedom and development have reached a level of which all the peoples of the third world can be proud.77.	Some nations like to preach human rights  but they do not hesitate to take action that infringes the sovereign right of another nation to choose its own destiny. The People's Republic of Benin abhors such hypocrisy. Our country is very much concerned over tensions resulting from a long history of exploitation and violation of human rights  aggravated in recent years by outside pressures and contempt for the principles  of non-intervention and non-interference. Far from improving  the situation is deteriorating further  and military manoeuvres  regardless of their scope  will unfortunately not help at all; all they will do is increase tension detrimental to the interests of the peoples of the region.78.	That is why our delegation welcomes the positive and constructive initiatives of the Contadora Group to try to ensure stable peace in Latin America. My country supports Security Council resolution 530 (1983) and urgently appeals to all States concerned to co-operate fully with the Contadora Group. The people of Benin assures all the peoples of that region of our untiring support as they confront the subversion and destabilization of which they are victims and as they defend their independence and freedom and take an anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist stand.79.	There is little need to point out that imperialism  by imposing its own version of law and order  by strengthening and reactivating its bases  by exporting oppression and by seeking to destabilize if not regain its lost colonial possessions is taking action to control our resources and to plunder them and is trying to act as an international policeman and to determine the direction our ideologies should take. There is indeed a close and intimate relation linking imperialism  under-development  the absence of peace and collective insecurity. The peoples of the third world are today fighting not only against oppression and exploitation  but also to preserve human civilization and for the right to life  and thus are fighting against the threat of nuclear extermination. Our peoples  and with them the peoples of the entire world  are trying not only to prevent war but also to bring about a real improvement in international relations  to strengthen and develop all good initiatives and to eliminate distrust and suspicion.80.	We should like to highlight the complex and sometimes controversial relationship between disarmament and international security or  if one prefersâand in fact it is the same thingâthe link between disarmament and development. The delegation of the People's Republic of Benin realizes with fear and anguish that the arms race not only increases the danger of a world-wide war but also places a heavy burden on the major Powers which induces them to neglect or abdicate their international responsibilities. The outrageous expenditures on arms and the unbelievable squandering of valuable resources could have been used to mobilize funds for aid to development and to improve the living conditions of peoples  including those in the developed countries. Our people  like every other people in the third world  is greatly concerned over the deplorable and senseless waste of resources  when Article 26 of the Charter advocates disarmament  In order to promote the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security with the least diversion for armaments of the world's human and economic resources . The past decade shows quite clearly that arms and development are competing for the resources of the planet and that under-development jeopardizes the security of nations.81.	While concern is shown for strengthening security and preventing violence and bloodshed which today are rife in so many parts of the world  the industrialized nations  in their traditional self-centeredness  are at the same time investing tremendous human and financial resources in improving the efficiency and destructive capacity of war machines simply to feed that lucrative trade in weapons and thus ensure the survival of the war and armaments industries.82.	Never until now has the Organization's strength as the preserver and dispenser of peace  although it has clearly penetrated the peoples' Held of vision  been so unreliable that the crusade against the independence of peoples and the grotesque and unscrupulous interference in the domestic affairs of other countries are continuing to the point that we doubt our ability to stop the deterioration and save the human race from a nuclear holocaust.83.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Benin  with the optimism born of its faith in the future  is convinced that it is still possible to prevent any further dangerous deterioration in the situation and that we must prevent the world from sliding towards catastrophe. For that reason the citizens of our country  the People's Republic of Benin  collectively and through us  appeal solemnly to the reason of all those in the world who hold positions of responsibility to prevent the irreparable from happening and by so doing ensure the pursuit of a policy directed towards the great goal of saving mankind.84.	At a time when mankind is called to make additional sacrifices to bring about future economic and financial recovery  we in Benin believe that a sense of responsibilityâon the national  collective and individual levelsâwill prevail over political differences  over rivalries between groups  blocs or individuals and over the bitterness and rancour caused by certain deplorable practices  whether in the distant or recent past or in the present. In this connection  we hope that the industrialized countries and the negotiators from the North will be able to shed their shell of insensitiveness and indifference to the poverty  suffering  malnutrition  ignorance and insecurity so rampant throughout the world and particularly in the third world.85.	Everyone knows that war is evil; everyone knows the price it exacts in human lives  in suffering and in the destruction of the things necessary to human life and development  not to mention the disturbance of the tranquillity that is so necessary and the deterioration in relations within the international community. The People's Republic of Benin  faithful to its desire for peace and to the decision of our people to build in freedom and independence a sovereign and prosperous nation  and convinced that the destructive capacity of any war  particularly nuclear war  has noticeably increased today to a planetary level  welcomes all sincere peace proposals and initiatives launched so far and hopes that everything possible will be done to give them practical effect. Thus  we must understand and support the expectation and desire of our peoples that the conferences on disarmament  security and peace should emerge from their present impasse  in order to promote the development  the progress and the survival of mankind.86.	Our delegation  aware that detente and security must be collective in order to be real  calls upon all the countries of the world  especially the nuclear Powers  to weigh objectively and reasonably the threatening tendencies in the present development of international relations and to draw reasonable conclusions there from  in the most basic interests of mankind. We urge the nuclear Powers finally to adopt effective disarmament measures and to devote the vast resources thus released to the economic and social development that is so urgently needed in the developing countries.87.	We see the world situation  as we have described it and as we are experiencing it in its political  economic and social aspects  as a gigantic machine  the key elements of which are out of alignment and almost worn out. Faced with such a disturbing situation  it would be wrong not to take action and even more wrong not to show any real desire for solidarity and concerted action.88.	The People's Republic of Benin has always maintained that  faced with the threat of total disintegration that hangs over the world economy and the threat of the nuclear apocalypse that weighs upon all mankind  we must get back to those virtues of frank dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation. The trend towards micro-nationalism and protectionism as separate ways out of the present stagnation will not yield solutions capable of meeting the needs and hopes of the peoples of our countries. Similarly  the arms race as an index of power or degree of development is but an abyss into which is deliberately poured vast financial resources that could and should be used to eradicate from the surface of the Earth poverty  hunger  malnutrition  disease  illiteracy  unemployment and armed conflict.89.	In spite of the pressures and manipulations of all sorts being exerted to keep Africa in a permanently peripheral and totally inactive status with regard to the ideals and goals that our continent's organization  the OAU  has freely decided to uphold  and in the light of the decisions adopted by that important body  the delegation of the People's Republic of Benin  true to the commitment of our country to co-operate with all States without exception or discrimination on the basis of respect for sovereignty  national dignity and the principle of non-interference  is prepared to join in all attempts at this session to find a way to give a new impetus to the efforts to achieve and defend the noble ideals of the Charter of the United Nations  namely  peace  equality  freedom  justice and social progress.90.	Ready for the revolution; the struggle continues."
"12",575,"BFA",38,1983,"ï»¿202.	Allow me first of all to offer the warm congratulations of my delegation to Mr. Illueca  Vice- President of Panama  on his election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. His country  Panama  belongs to a part of the world which  together with my continent  is suffering the blows and repercussions of disastrous policies conceived elsewhere. Thus a real solidarity unites us and compels me to express the hope that Panama  like Upper Volta  will work to establish more just international relations that will be more in accord with the profound desire for peace of the peoples of the world.203.	Our thanks go to Mr. Hollai  who so successfully directed our work at the thirty-seventh session.204.	We also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General  whose devotion to the ideals of the Charter and whose efforts in the service of the Organization we highly appreciate. His latest report again bears the marks of a clear and constructive commitment.205.	We bid a special welcome to Saint Christopher and Nevis  which has just joined us  and we are convinced that it will make a noticeable contribution to the cause of justice and peace.206.	It is against the background of a tormented world that the present session is opening. Although the world has always been tormented  it has never shown so many signs of instability and possible destruction. Sufficient proof of this is the tragedy of the South Korean aircraft. which illustrates the absurd  criminal and extreme nature of the rivalry between the two super-Powers.207.	It is 38 years since we defined principles and objectives to accord with the will of peoples to live in peace and in justice for a harmonious development. Today  a survey of the international situation raises many questions and leads us to believe that the profession of faith of the United Nations 38 years ago has now become an unattainable dream. The desire for domination of various parties has made more remote the advent of that world which was to mark  as the Charter prescribed   faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small .208.	It was that faith that inspired the change that took place in Upper Volta on 4 August 1983. It is because we have faith in man  it is because we demand dignity and respect  it is because under the weight of extraneous difficulties we were very close to losing all hope  that we resolutely took the road laid down by the National Revolutionary Council.209.	As a sovereign State profoundly attached to the ideals of non-alignment  Upper Volta affirms the right of its people to choose its own path to progress freely and without any tutelage. Upper Volta affirms its right to choose its friends in the world freely on the basis of their specific attitude towards the profound and legitimate aspirations of its people.210.	The revolution in Upper Volta is not directed against any country  any State or any people. At the national level it signifies an affirmation of our identity  the restoration of our dignity and  at the international level  a reaching out towards other peoples and a sincere desire for true co-operation for a more just world. Our vision of the world is the result of that attitude and makes it our duty to identify and to condemn anything that may hamper the forward progress of mankind towards its fulfilment.211.	In our world  a prey to many upheavals  the constant quest for peace remains the major imperative of the Organization  for without peace none of the objectives we pursue can be achieved.212.	In this regard we must note that South Africa has this year again made its contribution of horror and injustice  strengthened in its wrongdoing by the complicity of Western States and multinational corporations. The racist clique of Pretoria continues its evil deeds against our brothers of South Africa and the region. In murdering the patriots of the African National Congress  South Africa is once again signing in blood its refusal to heed and to satisfy the just and legitimate claims of a people that has been tortured  trampled underfoot and humiliated merely because of the colour of its skin  a skin colour that has been the basis for the establishment of the most shameful contemporary system of economic exploitation:	For over and above the overt racism of which it is the supreme expression  apartheid is the monstrous product of imperialism and capitalism in their unbridled and immoral quest for profit. On that altar the blacks of South Africa and all whose colour resembles theirs are sacrificed.213.	Not content with that indignity  the racists of Pretoria and their accomplices have added Namibia to their sinister list of preyâNamibia  fighting under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative  SWAPO; Namibia  fighting for its independence  its freedom and its dignity; Namibia  fighting to make its contribution to justice and peace in the world; Namibia  which the United Nations should  with the active  diligent and responsible support of the permanent members of the Security Council and within the framework of Council resolution 435 (1978)  have brought to total independence.214.	The ambiguous activities of and lack of results from the contact group can be explained by that group's failure to respect the terms of resolution 435 (1978) and by the horse-trading spirit of some of its members. The independence of Namibia cannot be linked with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The Cuban troops are in Angola by the sovereign decision of a sovereign State confronted by destabilizing acts carried out by South Africa on its territory and in neighbouring countries  but the presence of South Africa's troops in Namibia is illegal and has been unanimously condemned by the international community. We hope that the States that persist in linking those two questions will recognize that South Africa continually violates fundamental freedoms and human rights and the principles of international law  yet they refuse to apply against South Africa the sanctions provided for in the Charter.215.	The reason for this iniquity is that the system of apartheid is based on a military  economic and political strategy whose logic is to destroy the struggle of our brothers in South Africa  to prevent Namibia's accession to real independence and to sow trouble  terror and desolation in all the front-line States to prevent them from giving their support to the liberation struggle of our brothers in South Africa and Namibia. Such a policy is  in fact  sanctioned  buttressed and protected by States which  for the sake of their economy and their interests  care little or nothing for the purposes and principles proclaimed by the Charter. Yet certain of those States  as permanent members of the Security Council  have a special responsibility as regards the international community and its rules. This bitter truth is the result of the desire of one country or group of countries to govern the world in accordance with its interests and its interests alone.216.	The total rejection of this state of affairs has led us in Upper Volta to adopt the anti-imperialist struggle as the keystone of our foreign policy. Our anti-imperialism is the tenacious determination to govern our own fate despite the immense weight and gigantic stature of that implacable enemy  visible or invisible  with all its tentaclesânamely  imperialism. Imperialism is the vice of the man who wants everything for himself and nothing for his neighbour but alienation or annihilation. We are unwilling to be either alienated or annihilated. We wish to live in freedom; we wish to live with dignity; we want to be able to satisfy our needs; and  above all  we want and we demand a just  brotherly and peaceful world. In that spirit we extend a hand to all peoples in the struggle for a world in which the choice will no longer be alienation or annihilation for any of us. Annihilation is what lies in wait for Chad  bloodied by war for more than a decade. There  foreign weapons are killing and the people of Chad are dying.217.	For its part  the National Revolutionary Council strongly denounces the return to a gunboat policy and the internationalization of the conflict in Chad. It condemns the colonial expedition organized to stifle the just and legitimate aspirations of the people of Chad. That war is a matter of concern to the Government and people of Upper Volta because for nearly three months now it has been of such serious proportions as to give free rein to the ambitions of the imperialist and neo-colonialist forces of aggression and enemies of our peoples.218.	Upper Volta will not tolerate such imperialist  hegemonist military interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign State. It believes that every effort must be made  under the auspices of the OAU  to bring about the unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from Chad  to oppose all the imperialist and neo-colonialist enemies of Africa that advocate or encourage foreign intervention  in Chad  to assist Chad to recover its national unity  territorial integrity and national sovereignty  and to strive to unite all the vital forces of Chad for national reconstruction and economic and social development.219.	The fate of a people  we are firmly convinced  must be decided solely by that people. In this vein  and in accordance with the resolution adopted last June at the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [seewe hope that a referendum for the purpose of general and free self-determination will speedily be prepared and held in Western Sahara so that the Saharan people may decide their fate and peace may return to that region.220.	We deplore the failure to achieve specific results because of Morocco's refusal to agree to direct negotiations with POLISARIO.2 Morocco is thus responsible for the failure of the Implementation Committee meeting called for at the nineteenth session of the OAU Assembly on the basis of a consensus resolution. We note the solemn declaration made before the internal Assembly on 27 September by His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco. Upper Volta  for its part  urges all parties to ensure that the OAU resolution is implemented within the deadline fixed.221.	With regard to the brother people of the Comoros  we express to them our active solidarity in the legitimate efforts they are exerting to preserve the independence  unity and territorial integrity of the Comoros through reintegration of the island of Mayotte. We appeal to France to act in accordance with its constitutional traditions and consider the overall results of the referendum held on 22 December 1974 as applying to the whole of the Comorian territory.222.	Peace and justice in the Middle East are victims of the desire for power. We see Lebanon fragmented and broken up  its territorial integrity  its sovereignty and its national unity continually compromised. Israel  which is evil incarnateâand this is a sad state of affairs for a people that has suffered so muchâhas by its unbridles pursuit of a policy of force and arbitrary action created instability and trouble in the region. Israel  again  has not hesitated to exacerbate the wounds of the past in Lebanon and to aggravate the tensions created by foreign occupationâand all this in the name of the policy of might makes right. Israel has abandoned all decent conduct and refuses to accept the evidence before it.223.	The question of Palestine is at the heart of the Middle East problem. The question of Palestine is at the origin of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Palestinian people has been plundered and deprived of its inalienable rights. Its struggle is a just one  and its sole legitimate representative  the PLO  must participate in any solution that is drawn up. Israel is not entitled to speak on behalf of the Palestinians and must abandon its policy of aggression and annexation of Arab territories.224.	Some weeks ago the International Conference on the Question of Palestine was held at Geneva  and Upper Volta participated in it. Here we express again our total support for the conclusions of that Conference  and we associate ourselves with Chairman Yasser Arafat in calling for the holding of an international conference with the effective participation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  the United States of America  the PLO and all the other parties concerned.225.	Since the beginning of the conflict between Iraq and Iran  we have been deploring the immense loss of human life and the damage caused to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Our position remains the same  and we condemn an obstinacy that is weakening the ranks of the Movement when we are called to more urgent  more constructive and more noble tasks. We renew the Movement's appeal and hope it will be heeded.226.	With regard to Afghanistan and Kampuchea  faithful to our commitments and our convictions we call for the withdrawal of all the foreign troops and for a solution in conformity with the right of peoples to self-determination and independence.227.	We are in favour of the peaceful reunification of Korea without any foreign interference.228.	In Latin America  Upper Volta supports the efforts by Mexico  Venezuela  Panama and Colombia in the Contadora Group. Upper Volta believes that any initiatives in the area should contribute to a just and peaceful solution  rather than fanning the flames of violence and war. The sound of boots marching through the region will never be able to break the will and determination of peoples to free themselves from the present sad conditions that afflict us and are aimedâin vainâat paralysing our peoples' efforts on the path to their salvation.229.	As I speak of salvation I cannot but refer to the terror we feel at the unbridled arms race. Need I recall the astronomical sums that man  in his destructive folly  is expending each year on the construction of arsenals and deadly weapons that are ever more sophisticated  more monstrous and more capable of suddenly halting mankind's forward march and annihilating us all. And meanwhile thousands of children throughout the world suffer and die of malnutrition and millions of human beings suffer from hunger and illiteracy and are vegetating in a state of absolute poverty. This complete lack of reason and sensibility is a blot on mankind's escutcheon.230.	We must deplore the fact that at the very moment when we speak of the risks of a nuclear cataclysm the United States has granted racist South Africa a loan of $50 million to strengthen the apartheid regime's nuclear potential  thus increasing the threats to peace and security in the region.231.	The failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development shows the degree to which the international community is now making sacrifices to valueless and meaningless rites. As if the disastrous consequences of the present economic crisis were not enough to awaken our conscience  that session at Belgrade once again demonstrated the industrialized countries' selfishness and determination to do nothing that could encourage better relations between the North and the South in a lasting and genuine way.232.	Obsessed by short-term concerns  the industrialized countries pursue a policy of holding back and not giving an inch  a policy that threatens our common future. The status of the North-South dialogue is itself an eloquent indication of the state of mind of the industrialized countries. Our countries have for half a decade now been exhausting our resources and getting into debt to organize costly conferences or to attend them. Despite our good will and our readiness to co-operate  each of us in a responsible position must wonder what has changed as a result of our participation in these conferences.233.	We must recognize that often the developing countries originate these meetings. Experience  however  teaches  that holding such meetings too frequently can in the long run amount to de facto complicity with the industrialized countries  which merely take ad hoc measures and never decide to reply correctly to the fundamental question posed as long ago as 1973 during the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  at Algiersâthat is  the promotion of the new economic order.234.	Indeed  the promotion of a new international economic order is urgently required. The financial  trade and monetary institutions and policies have since 1945 led us to the present impasse  partly because even the rules of the game have not been respected and partly because those rules were based  more or less subtly  on economies that were already dominated or were to be dominated.235.	The continued rise of the dollar is disturbing the exchanges and doing serious permanent harm to the economies of the developing countries. Thus  those countries' external debt is becoming increasingly burdensome. Moreover  their imports of capital goods increase the deficit in their balance of trade while  at the same time  protectionist measures are applied against their exports by the developed countries. One cannot but note that some of the countries with the largest indebtedness are among the largest producers of oil  which proves  if proof were needed  that the deep reasons for the present crisis have to do more with structures than with circumstances.236.	Whatever may be the curves and projections  there is one fact that we cannot escape: the countries of the South are stagnating or  even worse  going backwards. The picture is all the more disturbing when we see the gloomy prospects for the year 2000 in regard to agriculture  the basis of the economic activity of most of the developing countries. The achievement of self-sufficiency in food remains difficult  both for climatic and for structural reasons.237.	At Belgrade the industrialized countries were not willing to enter into any commitment on questions of assistance  eliminating indebtedness and increasing the liquidity of IMF and the International Development Association. It is clear that our economies are adrift because the world crisis has been imposed on us without our having any share of the responsibility for creating that crisis. Inflation and the crisis in the international monetary and financial system are evils that have been created elsewhere and from which we suffer through no fault of our own.238.	The inequality in North-South relations is compounded by the breakdown in international solidarity. For example  to do away with the instability in export revenues  a Common Fund for Commodities was established in UNCTAD. The delegation of Upper Volta notes with bitterness that certain industrialized countries which could have played a considerable role in the implementation of the Agreement establishing that Fund have refused to sign or ratify it. Furthermore  some countries wish to give priority to the flow of private capital in market conditions. The enormous indebtedness of the developing countries proves the futility of a policy of progressively drying up the sources of public aid or multilateral assistance for the benefit of sources of private capital. Budgetary deficits  the chronic imbalance in the balance of payments and frequent recourse to borrowing are the concomitant elements of such a policy  which  while it benefits one side  totally exhausts the other. The combined effects of those phenomena explain the increasingly wide gap separating developed from developing countries. It is high time to put an end to this state of affairs  which can but lead mankind to ruin.239.	The OAU  in adopting a plan of action for endogenous and self-maintained development of the continent  seeks to put an end to this chain of events. At the wider level of the Group of 77  a concern has been expressed to combine our efforts for true co-operation in integrated development. The Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi  has made what we consider to be realistic proposals intended to revive the global negotiations and the North-South dialogue. It seems to us that these three approaches offer us a glimmer of hope.240.	What the facts we have just described actually mean for our peoples are continued hunger  thirst  malnutrition  poverty  ignorance and disease. The delegation of Upper Volta has come to this session of the General Assembly to make its contribution in the hard fight we must all wage against those scourges  so that  together with other nations  we can work for the well-being and happiness of our respective peoples.241.	However  while the will to co-operate is for us a necessity  we shall not allow it to be weakened by docile acceptance of relations from which our concerns and our priorities are excluded.242.	The picture is a gloomy one  but the magnitude of the task does not discourage us. Quite the contrary  it arouses and strengthens our determination always to struggle for a better world where there is a place for justice and solidarity. That is the price of international peace and security. United and determined  we shall overcome."
"13",618,"BGD",38,1983,"ï»¿227.	It is indeed an honour and a privilege for me and the members of my delegation to participate in the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We bring warm greetings from the Government and people of Bangladesh.228.	I take this opportunity of congratulating Saint Christopher and Nevis on its independence and welcome it to our midst in the United Nations.229.	On behalf of the delegation of Bangladesh and on my own behalf I wish to extend to you  Sir  our most sincere felicitations on your assumption of the high office of President of the Assembly. The constructive role of your great country  Panama  in connection with regional as well as international issues  as evidenced particularly in the remarkable efforts of the Contadora Group  has earned the deep appreciation of us all. Your own longstanding association with the United Nations gives us every reason to believe that under your able and dynamic leadership we shall be able to achieve some fruitful and constructive results at this session.230.	We were particularly moved by your inspiring address immediately after you took over the presidency. Your assessment of the international economic situation  coupled with your strong plea for adoption of action- oriented programmes by the Assembly  leads us to believe that you will be playing a leading part in what the vast majority of us perceive to be the most critical issue facing us at the present time  that of our ability to exercise political will  our constituencies notwithstanding  to face the realities of the international economic situation of the day and to apply that will to substantive dialogue and negotiations.231.	In this and other efforts  Mr. President  we assure you of our fullest support and co-operation in the discharge of your responsibility. I should like to express our sincere congratulations to the other officers of the Assembly on their election to the various positions of responsibility.232.	My delegation would like to take this opportunity to convey our deep appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  for the very able manner in which he guided the deliberations of the thirty- seventh session. His wisdom  dedication and diplomatic skill have won him the admiration of all.233.	I would also like to record our sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for his unremitting efforts to realize the objectives and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for his contribution to the cause of international security  peace and progress. The Secretary- General's illuminating report has been read with great interest  and I believe this document constitutes an important input to the work of the current session.234.	The thirty-eighth session must certainly count as one of the most exceptional and crucial sessions of the General Assembly. Already nearly 20 heads of State or Government have addressed us during this session. We have  for the first time during the General Assembly session  seen an exchange of views carried out  even though informal and outside the framework of the General Assembly  in a manner aimed at creating a direct impact on making our work here both more productive and meaningful. The thirty-eighth session also takes place at a time of unprecedented crisis. The international situation  both in the political and economic sense  has often been described as the worst since the Second World War. Indeed  it is not without reason that a number of speakers in recent days have recalled those sad and bitter days of the thirties which presaged the outbreak of the Second World War. But  however close the parallel  the world has not stood still these past 50 years. The eighties are not the thirties and the United Nations is not the League of Nations. The essential difference  during this epoch- making half century  has been the emergence of more than 100 independent sovereign Member States. This is what gives the United Nations its strength and moral authority. The presence of sovereign States has acted as a force of restraint and moderation in international affairs over the years.235.	The third world  the South  the developing countries  the three great continents of Africa  Asia and Latin America  constitute a major force in world events  both politically and economically. In times of distress and conflict  these countries  which make up more than three- fourths of the population of this globe  can become a powerful and effective force towards the maintenance of peace and stability. Our inability to recognize this important reality at times has caused not only the spirit  of international co-operation to suffer  but also the effectiveness of the United Nations.236.	The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  to which two thirds of the United Nations belong  has championed the cause of peace and justice since its inception. Its growing membership and consistent principles have established its natural role in sustaining peace and diffusing global tension. We believe that this great Movement is now an indispensable catalyst in promoting understanding among peoples  ideologies and nations.237.	I humbly submit that in our experience  democracy  no matter how we choose to interpret it  has never meant that the voice of one or two  or even a handful of countries  should determine the destiny of mankind. International co-operation cannot be built on an edifice where some dictate and others follow. Peace and security  like development  are built brick by brick through the active involvement and participation of all Member States Nowhere has this process been made more clearly visible or possible than at the General Assembly.238.	The 1950s and the 1960s witnessed tremendous development throughout the North  but the capacity of the developed countries to grow in any meaningful manner during the 1970s and 1980s was inextricably and inexorably linked to the fate of the developing countries. For it was the growth and development of this group of countries that constituted and provided the dynamic element of growth for the entire international community. For developing countries to grow and develop  two requirements stand out crystal clear: first and foremost is the creation of conditions of peace and stability  and the other is to create and maintain reasonable confidence in the economic system which could sustain us all. These requirements are interrelated and interdependent.239.	We have learned from recent history that progress in disarmament talks between the two super-Powers has a direct and positive impact on the international climate. Absence of progress has invariably resulted in an escalation in both numbers and quality of armaments  with concomitant pressures on countries both far and near. The interaction between disarmament and development and the glaring discrepancy between the amount spent on armaments and that spent on development do not bear recounting. Suffice it to say that the voice of the General Assembly must be heard loud and clear in support of concrete measures to promote disarmament and to divert resources from armament to development. One concrete way of doing this would be to institute without delay some measure of international taxation on all expenditure on nuclear arms.240.	This session of the General Assembly must also take concrete measures to arrest the increase in armaments  particularly nuclear weapons. We must devise ways and means to depoliticize  as far as possible  the consideration of such questions within the United Nations. Technical issues  particularly those relating to verification and assessment of relative strength  should be determined As objectively as possible  perhaps by seeking the advice of eminent experts or through creation of supra-national bodies similar to the International Court of Justice.241.	Many more substantial suggestions in this regard have been made during this session. What is important is that these proposals be studied and examined seriously in the coming days. Considering the almost unanimous view that the arms the single biggest threat to humanity  it is inconceivable that we should not take practical concrete measures at this session to at least partially redress the situation.242.	I must refer here to the recent tragedy involving a South Korean civilian airliner. The tragic incident is a manifestation of the brinkmanship to which we are prone at a time when all of us are engaged in avoiding conflicts and areas where peace exists at its critical limits. It reinforces our belief that even dimensions such as these pose a direct and serious threat to global peace and security  and we must therefore find ways and means to avoid a recurrence of such an unfortunate incident.243.	Many  if not most  small nations and developing countries such as my own attach the highest importance to the work of the United Nations system as a whole. Whether we vote for or against a resolution is a matter which is studied very carefully. Those are not decisions which are taken at the behest of anyone country or a group of countries. We make a conscious effort to weigh the pros and cons  looking for the principles underlying each issue. It is the respect for these principles that provides the greatest security for countries such as Bangladesh.244.	We want to see the development of a code of conduct for Member States  a code that permits no nation to take the law into its own hands. Bangladesh believes that the moral authority of the United Nations should be its greatest strength  a moral authority based on the principles embodied in the Charter. A strong United Nations whose voice is respected by all provides the best insurance and safeguard for all Member States. Moral authority and the political weight of the Organization are determined by its own Member States.245.	How seriously do each of us take the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council? Do the Articles of the Charter need to be invoked only when we find it convenient to do so? Where is the spirit that gave birth to the Charter? How can we choose to ignore the historic role played by the United Nations in the process of decolonization? More than 100 States have joined the Organization since its birth. The newly independent States of Africa  Asia and Latin America are in a sense the products of the United Nations. Certainly  the United Nations and their presence and participation in the work of the United Nations remain an important manifestation of the sovereignty and independence of these countries. The principle of one country  one vote is vital to the whole spirit of the sovereign equality of States and the essence of the Charter.246.	The persistent presence of colonialism and racism in southern Africa is an outrage to humanity. It continues to pose a dangerous threat to peace and security in the region. Bangladesh is irrevocably committed to the cause of the oppressed peoples of Namibia and South Africa. We pledge our unstinted support to their legitimate struggle for freedom  liberty and human dignity. We are fully convinced that their efforts will ultimately triumph. As an active member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  we firmly believe that the independence of Namibia can and must be achieved in accordance with the United Nations plan for Namibia  the only viable basis for peaceful transition of the territory from colonial subjugation to independence  and we have consistently asked for its full implementation without any modification whatsoever J247.	In the same spirit  we cannot condone the right of States to interfere in the affairs of other States. We have therefore consistently voted against the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. We should permit the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea to determine the governments of their choice. This should be done without the presence or threat of foreign troops.248.	We were dismayed when the sanctity of frontiers was so brutally violated by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Bangladesh expresses its deep sympathy for the brotherly people of Lebanon who have suffered so greatly. There can be no normalcy in Lebanon until there is a total withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Lebanese territory. We commend the efforts which have led to a cease-fire in that country  and I think we speak on behalf of all when we say that the efforts should now be extended to maintaining the cease-fire.249.	Bangladesh's position on the question of Palestine is clear and unequivocal. We have consistently maintained that any just and lasting peace in the area must be based on the acceptance by all parties of the fact that the question of Palestine lies at the heart of the crisis  that the acquisition of territory by force imposes an obligation on Israel to withdraw completely and immediately from all occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  and that the Palestinian people have the inalienable right to self-determination  including the right to have a State of their own in their homeland under the leadership of the PLO  their sole and legitimate representative. We strongly condemn the continued Israeli occupation of Arab and Palestinian territories and the defiant establishment of settlements. It is on the basis of these essential principles that we can foresee an end to the turmoil and strife that have tormented the region for over three decades. In this context  we have consistently supported the Arab peace plan as a sound basis for establishing durable peace in the region. The quiet but effective efforts being made by the Al-Quds al-Sharif Committee are equally aimed at contributing towards this peace process in the Middle East. The International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva only last month  has demonstrated once again the deep and firm commitment of the vast majority of the international community to the early restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.250.	We cannot but express our distress and anguish at the continued conflict between Iran and Iraq. We are convinced that both Iran and Iraq want peace  and our discussions with the leaders of these two countries convince us that the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Gulf Co-operation Council and the United Nations must continue to assist the process of peace both separately and  if necessary  through a co-ordinated effort. I must say that this war has not only brought in its trail untold suffering and destruction to the great peoples in those two countries  but has also cast a shadow on the prospect for global peace and security. We should therefore like to make a renewed appeal to both Iran and Iraq to take full advantage of the many proposals which have been made to them for bringing this conflict to an end. I would even submit that both these brotherly Moslem countries may wish to take advantage of the current session of the General Assembly for this purpose.251.	The unfortunate developments in the brotherly country of Chad also give us cause for concern  and it is our sincere hope that it will be possible to resolve this matter through peaceful means.252.	The lack of progress in the inter-communal talks between the Turkish-Cypriot and Greek-Cypriot communities has been a cause of concern to all of us. We urge both communities to engage in meaningful discussions for reaching a mutually acceptable solution of the problem that would enable them to live in honour and dignity within the framework of a federated Cyprus  where the rights of both communities ""will be fully protected. These talks have continued much longer than was expected  and unless there is some progress in the immediate future  the situation in Cyprus may take an irreversible turn.253.	If the effectiveness of the United Nations system is being eroded in the area of maintaining international peace and security  we notice with equal concern and alarm the drift away from multilateral co-operation and multilateral institutions towards bilateralism. That is all the more regrettable because Member States have always had the highest praise for the excellent work being done by various development agencies within the United Nations system. This tendency has perhaps become more pronounced as a result of the lack of progress in North- South dialogue aimed at international economic cooperation. Notwithstanding the considerable flexibility and pragmatism that marked the outcome of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned countries at New Delhi and the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 at Buenos Aires  we regret that there has been so little progress. The situation is further compounded by the fact that hopes were indeed raised when at the Summit of Industrialized Nations  at Williamsburg  the importance of the role of the South  the global nature of the current international economic crisis and the extent of interdependence between the North and the South were clearly acknowledged. At Belgrade also  at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  there was general agreement on the nature of the crisis and  in general terms  the remedial steps that were required  although there we faltered in the area of concrete measures. Why then  despite the present economic crisis involving both the North and the South  are we unable to act?254.	With regard to launching of the global negotiations  we feel there is an immediate need for close consultations within the framework of the United Nations  more particularly during this session  when we are already witnessing intensive initiatives at the highest level. We also feel that we should concentrate on exploiting those areas where agreement already exists or where agreement is possible. We believe that the time has come to step away from the Versailles meeting cul-de-sac and start meaningful negotiations here in New York.255.	We have noted with interest the recommendations recently made by the Committee for Development Planning on the subject of money and finance. Some other expert bodies nave also addressed themselves to this important subject. Recalling the proposal of the Conference of non-aligned countries  we believe that it would be useful if we could initiate at this General Assembly session preparations for an international conference on money and finance for development. But there is also a need for measures to be taken in favour of developing countries without any further delay.256.	The situation in the least developed countries is particularly desperate. These are the countries which now have little or no access to commercial credit and whose capacity for trade has been seriously hampered. Therefore  at least the following measures need to be taken urgently: a substantial increase in the official development assistance on highly concessional terms to the developing countries  particularly the least developed; the seventh replenishment of the International Development Association's funds to provide for a substantial increase in real terms in lending to recipients; a special drawing rights allocation of 15 billion for the next two-year period; the cancellation of all official debts of the least developed countries without any further loss of time; the waiving of all barriers of tariffs and quotas in respect of the least developed countries; commencement of the operations of the Common Fund to be set for 1 January 1984; abstention by developed countries from imposing new restrictions or other protectionist measures on any exports of developing countries; and full and effective implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries.257.	A number of other measures in the areas of food and agriculture  trade  raw materials  money and finance and energy should also be initiated. We should be in a position to take action on all these matters at this session of the Assembly.258.	One of the subjects to which we have attached the very highest importance in the Group of 77 has been the role of the United Nations system in support of economic co-operation among developing countries and the Caracas Programme of Action.? We are gratified to note that there has been some progress in this area  though much still remains to be done. The fundamental basis of South- South co-operation is that the South must be permitted to decide  of its own volition and without interference  the framework and substance of such co-operation. We sincerely hope that there will be no impediment created to the United Nations system's supporting the Group of 77 in strengthening and developing economic cooperation among developing countries.259.	I have endeavoured to explain why a country such as Bangladesh attaches so much importance to the United Nations and the United Nations system. In Bangladesh our own efforts during the past 18 months have focused on three broad fronts. First  we have endeavoured to take the Government to the people  and in so doing to engage the people more directly in the process of nation-building. Very belatedly in the post-colonial sense  we are the first in our region to reorganize the once remote local administration in the rural areas  where 90 per cent of the 95 million people of Bangladesh live  into effective and vibrant centres of real development activity. We are trying to provide infrastructural support for each of these centres  which we expect will also emerge as the first echelon of our political activity. 260.	Secondly  we have intensified efforts to implement various measures geared to making the country self-reliant  particularly in food production. We have also stepped up a country-wide family planning programme to reduce the growth of population.261.	These steps are aimed at moving us swiftly towards strengthening our representative institutions  which have always formed an integral part of our society. We shall hold local government elections throughout the country this winter. These will be followed by elections at higher echelons  leading to parliamentary elections in March 1985. These democratic processes are integral to our way of life. In our perception  it is equally indispensable that there be peace and stability to sustain development and democracy. This will explain why Bangladesh attaches such great importance to a more stable system in the global sense.262.	Bangladesh must be permitted to proceed unimpeded with the delicate and complex task of national reconstruction and development. We need the friendship  understanding and assistance of our neighbours  our friends  the international community and the United Nations system. Conscious of the need to create an atmosphere of harmony and accord in South Asia  Bangladesh has joined six other countries of the region in promoting regional co-operation. Very recently we held the first-ever meeting of seven South Asian foreign ministers. We have been able to identify specific areas of co-operation  and we remain confident in Bangladesh that as this regional co-operation develops so will the overall climate in the region.263.	In our efforts to build a solid base for the relaxation of regional and international tensions  we have always supported the creation of zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world. We have also consistently supported the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.264.	I wish to conclude by saying that the Bangladesh delegation expects to see the General Assembly take concrete and effective steps at its thirty-eighth session towards: the emergence of a free and independent State of Palestine; the emergence of a free and independent Namibia; the ending of the Iran-Iraq armed conflict; the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea; the halting of the arms race and the rapid scaling-down of nuclear armouries; the immediate launching of global negotiations and the initiation of preparations for a conference on money and finance for development; the adoption of a set of immediate measures in favour of developing countries; the strengthening and revitalization of the United Nations system through expression of full respect for and total observance of the goals and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations; the implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly; and the renewal of support for multilateral co-operation  as well as for the development activities of the United Nations system.265.	Above all  we should like to see the restoration of a sense of respect for the dignity of man  for human life; respect for the equality of man and his right to pursue a life of his choice  free from interference; and the restoration of healthy human values which ensure that we treat each other with compassion and understanding. "
"14",664,"BGR",38,1983,"ï»¿ I am very pleased  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the presidencyof the thirty-eighth session of the Lenora Assembly. Iam confident that under your competent guidance thework of the session will proceed fruitfully and successfully. I should also like to extend my gratitude to yourpredecessor  Mr. Hollai  for his skilful performance inoccupying that position during the thirty-seventh session.I avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate theSecretary General.52.	On behalf of my country I cordially welcome thenew Member of the United Nations  the State of SaintChristopher and Nevis.53.	Today more than ever before the attention of allpeoples is focused on the activities of the General Assembly. This is so because the major problems of our time and particularity the problem of how to prevent war andpreserve peace; have acquired truly vital significance forthe destiny of each and every individual every nation andthe whole of mankind. This is so because the presentinternational situation has given rise to extremely seriousgrounds for alarm. Since the Second World War therehas hardly been another such complicated and tense aperiod of history as the one we are living in today.54.	All this is the result of the course pursued by theUnited States and certain countries of NATO  the aimof which is to gain military-strategic superiority over theSoviet Union and the other countries of the socialistcommunity. That course has led to an unchecked escalation of the arms race  has dangerously exacerbated tensions in various regions of the world and has kindled newhotbeds of crisis.35. An integral part of this policy is total confrontation which has also been reflected in certain attempts to interfere in the Internal affairs of the socialist countries andto orchestrate slanderous campaigns.56.	The latest example in this respect has been thecampaign against the Soviet Union in connection with theincident involving the South Korean aircraft. While expressing our most sincere regret at the loss of human life we at the same time are convinced that the entire responsibility for this tragedy rests With those forces which cold-bloodedly masterminded and carried out this criminal andprovocative act. Those forces have gone so far in theirinsinuations as to deny elementary normal conditions forthe arrival of the head of the delegation of the SovietUnion for the General Assembly session.57.	This course in international affairs has in fact nofuture and no chance of success either in the political orin that  military feted. Because of the extremely dangerousrisks which it poses for the fate of the people  it hasnaturally met with the resistance of the overwhelmingmajority of States  which are profoundly interested inmaintaining peace and promoting equitable and mutualityadvantageous international co-operation. This was eloquently reaffirmed by the decisions of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-AlignedCountries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983which  as is well known constitute an important positive factor in the internationalarena. At the same time  the policy of rearmament andconfrontation has aroused protests by the broadest strataof the international community.58.	Never before have there been on Earth so many andsuch terrifying weapons capable of destroying life  andthat is why mankind has never been in so much need ofthe most energetic efforts to preserve peace and to eliminate the possibility that a nuclear war may become ahorrendous reality. The cardinal risk of our times is topreserve life on Earth and to save human civilization.59. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is convinced thatthe way out ivies it renouncing the policy of confrontationand the arms race and in proceeding towards genuinedisarmament  particularly in the nuclear field. A soundand realistic basis on which we can rely in the attemptsto attain this objective is the existing military-strategicbalance of forces. The whole war development ofthe world indicates that any effort to obtain militarysuperiority is futile and only increases the threat of a totalnuclear conflict. Action to ensure the security of everyState and of the world as a whole necessarily entailscurbing military confrontation through disarmament. Theonly alternative to mutual annihilation is the policy ofdisarmament and detente. At present this irrefutable truth has acquired exceedingly topical significance to Europe. An issue of vitaimportance for European as wet as for other peoples ofthe world is being dealt with in Europe today. The choicebefore our continent once again demands that  whiterejecting the propaganda smokescreen  the facts are reconsidered most responsibly and a sober and realistic appraisal be made of the consequences. The truth is thatthe planned deployment of new United States medium range nuclear missiles in certain Western EuropeanNATO countries is designed to ensure unilateral militarysuperiority and represents deliberate preparation for anuclear first strike against the socials countries. Theargument that the deployment of those missiles wouldfacilitate the conclusion of an arms reduction agreementis totally unfounded. Naturally  our countries would becompelled to take counter-measures for their legitimatedefence. The only tangible result of the deployment ofthe new missies in Western Europe would be to increasethe level of nuclear confrontation and the risk of turningthe continent into an area of nuclear conflict. n ournuclear age the security of some States cannot be achievedat the expense of the security of others. It is incumbentupon all States and political leaders to take all this intoconsideration.61.	The Geneva talks between the Soviet Union andthe United States have entered their crucial stage. Thestepped-up preparations for the deployment of the newUnited States missiles  however  which are proceedingside by side with the talks  cause most serious concern.In our opinion  it is still not too late to choose to reacha fair agreement based on the principle of equality andequal security. This historic opportunity should act bemissed. A substantial step forward In this respect isrepresented by the latest constructive proposal putforward by the Soviet Union.62.	As a European county  the People's Republic ofBulgaria maintains the position that our responsibility topresent and future generations entail the elimination ofthe nuclear danger in Europe  thus giving impetusto detente so that Europe can become a continent ofpeace  free of weapons of mass destruction  where allStates could maintain relations of co-operation on thebasis of fuel equally and mutual respect  in the interestof the progress and prosperity of nations.63.	A hopeful sign in this respect is the successful concision of the Madrid meeting. It confirms once againthat  given good political will  it is possible even in thepresent complex international situation to pursue a dialogue leading to mutually acceptable agreements. In ouropinion  it itâs vitally important for the process whichbegan at Helsinki  to continue and to advance  and to develop in conformity with the spiritof the Conference on Security and Co-operation. In view of the most topical and urgentproblems facing our continent  we emphasize as particularly significant and promising the decision to convene a Conference on Confidence- and Security-buildingMeasures and Disarmament in Europe.64.	The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones invarious regions of Europe and the world is of majorimportance for the maintenance of peace. For this reasonthe People's Republic of Bulgaria not only supports therealistic proposals put forward to this effect but is activelyworking in this direction.65.	Situated as it is in the Balkan peninsula  the People'sRepublic of Bulgaria has a vital stake in the realizationof the idea of turning this region into a nuclear-weapon-free acne. The concrete proposals of my country forstepping up efforts to this end are also wall known. Theyare fully consonant with the policy based on the principlesof peace  understanding and co-operation in the Balkanswhich the People's Republic of Bulgaria has been consistently pursuing. In this respect  I should like to recall our proposal for the signing of acode of good-neighbourly relations among countries inthat part of Europe. This policy of principle is in the bestinterest of all the Balkan and European peoples and isa genuine contribution to the strengthening of peace andsecurity in the world.66.	Situated in close proximity to the Mediterranean the People's Republic of Bulgaria Is interested in fosteringpeace and co-operation in that region and regards withgreat interest all constructive proposals directed to thisend.67.	For the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the othercountries of the socialist community as well  the desirefor peace stems from the very nature of the socialistsystem. A society which is entirely devoted to work andconstruction for the benefit of all Its members cannotdesire war. Such a society does not need any war. WarIs alien to its very nature. Such a society needs peace aswell as mutually beneficial and equitable internationalco-operation. It is precisely for this reason that the Statesof the socialist community have unswervingly pursued and wilt continue to pursue  a constructive policy ofprinciple directed to defending peace  strengthening international security and promoting confidence and cooperation among peoples. In the present-day world thereIs no other road open but that of peaceful coexistenceof States with different social systems and the buildingof International relations on the basis of strict observanceof the principles of the Charter of the United Nationsand the rules of international law.68.	In the present particularly Importantâand I wouldeven say fatefullyâmoment for the future of mankind  thepeace-loving policy of the countries of the socialist community was once again reaffirmed in the Politician Declaration at Prague on 5 January 1983.  These documents contain detailed assessments of the current international situation as wellas constructive and realistic initiatives and proposals foreasing tensions and for solving the cardinal problems ofthe present day: first and foremost  the elimination ofthe danger of nuclear war  the cessation of the armsrace and the pursuance of disarmament on the basis ofequality and equal security.69.	Unfortunately these concrete proposals and initiatives for reducing the military threat in Europe and inthe world have not reached all adequate answer from theStates members of NATO.70.	The proposal for concluding a treaty on the mutualnon-use of force and on the maintenance of peacefulrotations Is still without a concrete answer.71.	The clearly expressed will of the majority of countries in the world that all nuclear-weapon States shouldfactor the example of the Soviet Union and assume theobligation not to be the first to use nuclear weaponscontinues to be ignored.72.	Nor has there been a positive reaction to the Sovietproposal that alt nuclear-weapon States should declarea quantitative and qualitative freeze of the existing levelof their nuclear weapons.73.	Just before the opening of this session  the SovietUnion came forward with an Important and timely proposal for the conclusion of a treaty on the prohibitionof the use of force in outer space and from space againstthe Earth. We welcome and support thisproposal. It is fully in conformity with the perennialefforts of the world Organization to forestall the launching of the arms race into space.74.	The proposal of the States parties of the WarsawTreaty to open negotiations on limiting naval activities on curtailing and reducing naval armaments and onextending confidence-building measures to Include theseas and oceans are also well known. The question has beenacquiring ever greater significance as a substantial partof the efforts to prevent nuclear war.75.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria is deeply concerned over the lack of real progress In the efforts toeliminate existing hotbeds of tension.76.	The situation in the Middle East continues to beextremity dangerous  as the region Is being increasinglyturned into a front tine of the aggressive global policyof certain imperialist States. With the encouragement andsupport of the latter  Israel continues Its aggressionagainst the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples. We categorically condemn these actions and insist on Israel'scomplete withdrawal from Lebanon as well as from allthe Arab territories occupied in 1967 and since. Wedemand the recognition of the legitimate and Inalienablerights of the Arab people of Palestine  including its rightto self-determination and the creation of Its own State.77.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria is convinced thatthe only correct avenue for reaching a comprehensive just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem as emphasized In the Geneva Declaration on Palestine Is convening an international peace conference on theMiddle East with the participation of all parties concerned  Including the indispensable participation on anequal footing of the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine.78.	We support the efforts to reach a peaceful and justsolution of the problem of Cyprus  guaranteeing theindependence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus  with the totaldemilitarization of the island and respect for the interestsof the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots.79.	As a result of the illegal occupation of Namibia bythe racist regime of Pretoria and its policy of apartheidand aggression against the independent African States ofthe region  the situation in southern Africa continues tobe tense and dangerous. The People's Republic of Bulgaria fully supports the legitimate struggle for self-determination and independence waged by the Namibianpeople under the leadership of its sole authentic representative  SWAPO. Our position is fully in harmony withthat of the majority of States in the world  which hasbeen most categorically expressed in the decisions of theUnited Nations  as well as by the international Conference in Support of the Struggle of the Namibian Peoplefor Independence  held in Paris from 25 to 29 April 1983.80.	The military presence in  and direct intervention of the imperialist States in the internal affairs of a numberof countries pose a threat not only to the security ofindividual countries and regions  but also to world peaceand security. We resolutely call for a habit to the campaignof threats and provocations against Cuba  to the foreignintervention in Nicaragua  to any interference in theinternal affairs of these and other countries of CentralAmerica. We are hopeful that the efforts of the countriesof the Contadora Group to find a peaceful solution tothe problems will be successful.81.	I reiterate that the People's Republic of Bulgariawholeheartedly supports the proposals put forward bythe Governments of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic  the People's Republic ofKampuchea and the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea to remove the tensions around these countries andsoave disputes through negotiations in order to ensurepeace and tranquillity for their peoples. The eliminationof the imperialist intervention in Afghanistan  the establishment of a zone of peace and stability in South-EastAsia and the peaceful reunification of Korea will contribute enormously to the strengthening of peace andsecurity in Asia and throughout the world.82.	The United Nations has a great role to play insolving the key problems of the present day  which affect?the interests of all States and peoples.The maintenance of peace and ending the arms raceare the most important prerequisites for the successful?solution of the pressing socio-economic and other problems upon which mankind's prosperity depends.84.	We devote particular attention to the problems ofdevelopment. As a country with a dynamic and stableeconomy  we are interested in the removal of artificialobstacles and barriers and in the promotion of equitableand mutually beneficial co-operation  a guarantee forwhich would be the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis and theestablishment of a new international economic order. Inthis connection  we support the demand for a speedybeginning of global negotiations  and we are ready tostudy any constructive proposal in this important area.85.	In conclusion  I return to the underlying theme ofmy statementâhow to preserve peace and save the planetfrom a nuclear catastrophe. For us Bulgarians  there isonly one answer. As Tudor Zhukov  General Secretaryof the Central Committee of the Bulgarian CommunistParty and President of the State Council of the People'sRepublic of Bulgaria  has said:""The question today is as follows: either we livePeacefully with each other or we annihilate each other.Therefore  the main conclusion we must draw cannotbe but the following: to build step by step  consistencyand decisively  new international relations  relations ofpeaceful co-existence between States of different socialsystems.""86.	Now  as in the past  we are ready to co-operate withall who are rally for peace  international understandingand mutually beneficial co-operation. We shall continueto work to strengthen the role of the United Nations  instrict compliance with the principles and objectives enshrined in its Charter. These principles and objectivescorrespond to the interests of all peoples. The People'sRepublic of Bulgaria will continue to make an activecontribution to their realization. "
"15",709,"BHR",38,1983,"ï»¿122.	It gives me great pleasure  in the name of the State or Bahrain  to offer congratulations to Mr. Jorge Illueca on his election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Undoubtedly his experience as a diplomat and statesman in his friendly country of Panama will contribute to the success of the work of this session. I should like also to thank Mr. Imre Hollai for the efforts which he made in conducting the work of the thirty-seventh session. It is my pleasure also to thank the Secretary-General for his continuous efforts to strengthen the role of the Organization and ensure the achievement of its aims and objectives  particularly the maintenance of peace and security in the world.123.	It is also my pleasure to congratulate the Government and people of Saint Christopher and Nevis on the occasion of its admission to membership in the Organization.124.	We meet each year in this international assembly to exchange views and thoughts on the best ways of dealing with the many economic  political and social issues of concern to the international community. The complex problems facing the world at present do not promise any improvement in international relations in the near future. Each year international crises are intensifying while the international community is unable to control or resolve them. Conflict among States  particularly the two super-Powers  intensifies day by day without any real attention being paid to the principles of co-operation and justice in international relations.125.	Undoubtedly such a situation increases our concern and apprehension  since the international community has not been able  38 years after the establishment of the United Nations  to give effect to the Charter principle regarding the non-use of force in relations between States. Many States still pursue a policy of force in international relations  particularly when acute political crises arise. The stronger party in a dispute may proceed to use military force against the other party  regardless of the principles of the United Nations and of international agreements.126.	The authors of the Charter of the United Nations took into account the sufferings of the peoples of the world resulting from the policy of the use of force in two destructive world wars  which had shattered the hopes of those peoples for security and peace. The principles of the Charter were therefore laid down to meet the aspirations of the peoples of the world and to guide States in their relations with one another  as a prelude to the establishment of a new order in international relations based on the principle of collective security within an international framework agreed upon by all Member States.127.	Today  if we carefully examine the Charter  which we have all agreed to maintain and whose principles we have agreed to uphold  and if we consider the serious confusion and disorder existing in international relations  we realize that there are wide divergences. Events have confirmed that it is impossible to apply the principle of collective security in the present situation  when some great Powers support States which pursue a policy of perpetual and flagrant aggression. This obvious fact is amply proved by the continuous aggression of Israel against the Arab States without any international deterrence.128.	The questions of the weakening of the role of the United Nations in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the non-adherence to the principles of the Charter in international relations are the two main problems to which we should pay much attention if we wish to maintain the solidarity of the Organization and strengthen its impact on international relations. We have no doubt that those two problems represent the main challenge facing the United Nations in this decade  in which there are so many persistent problems that need to be tackled with patience and reason.129.	We should thus pursue a policy that takes account of the changes in inter-State relations  particularly in the last two decades  which have seen great changes in various fields. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries was established to lay down principles and concepts of independence  liberty and freedom from foreign influence. Thus the principle of interdependence in relations between States has been given a political context with the aim of establishing a new world order based on co-operation  equality and peace.130.	The declaration of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi last March reaffirmed that collective view of the non- aligned countries  irrespective of differences in their political  economic and social systems. The principle of interdependence in international relations has therefore become a historic necessity in this age and not merely a theoretical requirement  as some tend to think. Thus it is wrong to think that disarmament and the limitation of nuclear arms are of interest only to the two superpowers and some great Powers. The fear of nuclear weapons and of rearmament has become an obsession that torments the whole of mankind. Similarly  the economic problems discussed by the leaders of the rich industrialized countries at their Summit at Williamsburg from 28 to 30 May 1983 are of as much interest to the developing countries as they are to the industrialized countries.131.	This gloomy picture of international relations should not discourage us. It should provide an incentive for more serious international action. The call of the Prime Minister of India  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  in her capacity as Chairman of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  to the leaders of the world to participate in this thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly has come at a time when we are in the utmost need of collective action. We hope that the leaders of the world who are participating in the Assembly's discussions will contribute to promoting the role of the United Nations as an international organization attempting to establish a world order that will ensure stability  security  peace and justice for all nations.132.	We believe that regional co-operation based on interdependence which interacts with the international environment provides an effective means for promoting political stability and maintaining world peace and security. The establishment of the Gulf Co-operation Council is therefore a constructive step toward strengthening the political  economic and social ties among its members through collective regional co-operation at all levels  depending on their own capabilities. The establishment of the Council was as a natural response to the political  economic and social development of the region  in particular as the States of the Council are keen to stay aloof from zones of conflict  foreign influence and international polarization133.	The Constructively pursues efforts to co-ordinate co-operation among its members. The third summit meeting of the Gulf Co-operation Council  held at Manama from 9 to 11 November 1982  approved a unified economic agreement which was put into effect early this year. It aims at establishing economic integration among the member States and lays down a unified economic policy towards other States and regional economic groups  in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations  regarding regional co-operation among States.134.	The crux of the Arab-Israeli conflict is the question of the people of Palestine  the solution of which involves recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to establish a State on their national soil under the leadership of the PLO. The realization of this fact by Israel has led it  since establishment  to launch frequent attacks on neighbouring Arab countries and against Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territories. Each time its aim has been to create a new de facto political situation and to impose its policy on its neighbours by armed force. The Security Council has been unable throughout to apply Chapter VII of the Charter because of the use time and again by the United States of the veto against any draft resolution that attempts to impose deterrent sanctions against Israel for its flagrant violations of the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations.135.	The Arab leaders who met at Fez for the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference adopted  on 9 September 1982  an Arab plan to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict  namely  the question of Palestine and the occupied Arab territories. That eight-point plan is a serious attempt to find a just and durable solution for the Middle East region. It is clear that the Fez plan derives its elements from United Nations principles and resolutions  which call upon Israel to withdraw from all occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  and to dismantle all settlements which it has unlawfully established on such territories. The plan also reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  the exercise of their imprescriptible and inalienable rights and the establishment of an independent State on their national soil  under the leadership of the PLO. These essential elements were reaffirmed by the SeventhConference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries.136.	Israel has rejected the Fez peace plan for the Middle East and other international initiatives and by such rejection has proved again that it does not want peace. Israel has been able to conceal its expansionist policies and deceive world public opinion for a while by pretending to be a small State which seeks stability and peace with its hostile neighbours. It has thereby been able to distort the facts and commit acts of aggression  since its establishment  on unfounded pretexts. The world has now come to know Israel in its true shape as an aggressive settler and racist State  which has committed  against the Palestinian people in the Sabra and Shatila camps and elsewhere  crimes and massacres which have shocked the world by their horror.137.	The International Conference on the Question of Palestine was held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September in pursuance of General Assembly resolutions 36/120 C and ES-7/7. One hundred thirty-seven States attended the Conference  of which 20 were there as observers. The PLO was accepted for the first time as a full participant in the Conference.138.	The Conference issued the Geneva Declaration on Palestine and the Programme of Action for the Achievement of Palestinian Rights .3 In its Declaration  the Conference called on the General Assembly to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations to find a comprehensive and just solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  an essential element of which would be the establishment of an independent Palestinian State. A11 parties concerned with the Arab-Israeli conflict should participate in the conference on an equal footing  including the PLO  the United States of America and the Soviet Union. The International Conference on the Question of Palestine considered that the Arab peace plan unanimously adopted at Fez was one of the proposals that should serve as guidelines for concerted international action. The Conference laid down in its Declaration six principles and guidelines for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. The Conference also decided on a programme of action to enable the Palestinian people to attain and exercise their rights in Palestine in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principles of international law. We call upon the General Assembly to adopt and implement the resolutions of the Conference  and we urge all States of the world to implement these resolutions and put an end to the conflict in the Middle East  which becomes more serious the longer it lasts.139.	Last year Israeli forces invaded Lebanon and wreaked havoc and total destruction on its towns and villages. They killed thousands of civilians and committed horrible massacres of innocent and unarmed Lebanese and Palestinians  contrary to all morality.140.	The development of events in our sister State of Lebanon as a result of the Israeli invasion and occupation of its territory has caused the local situation in Lebanon to erupt and tension in the region to increase. We appeal to all States to act and put an end to the Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory and to help keep Lebanon a unified  sovereign Arab State. We welcome also the agreement reached recently to initiate national reconciliation talks among all Lebanese parties. We commend likewise the positive role played by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in this respect.141.	The war between the two neighbouring countries of Iraq and Iran still continues despite the initiatives and attempts at mediation made by many international bodies to put an end to that destructive war  which has exhausted the human  economic and military resources of both countries. The report of the Secretary-General of 20 June 1983/ prepared by the mission which visited both Iraq and Iran to assess the damage to civilian areas caused by military action  shows some of the damage suffered by both countries.142.	It is well known that since its outbreak that war has had adverse effects in one form or another on the whole region. The countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council have made sincere and serious efforts to put an end to that war. The Foreign Ministers of the State of Kuwait and the State of the United Arab Emirates visited Teheran and Baghdad to find a solution that would establish a just peace between the two neighbouring Muslim States.143.	We appeal once again to the two warring parties to settle their differences by peaceful means and restore normal relations between them  on the basis of mutual respect  good neighbourliness and non-intervention in their domestic affairs.144.	We should like to welcome in this connection the positive response of Iraq to all international mediation efforts aimed at putting an end to this war by peaceful means. We hope that it will not be long before the two neighbouring countries settle their differences peacefully so that peace may prevail throughout the region.145.	There are other important international questions that occupy the attention of the world and threaten the security and stability of peoples.146.	The Soviet forces still occupy Afghanistan against the will of the Afghan people  whose resistance against the occupation is daily growing stronger. We should like to reaffirm that any solution to this question should be consistent with the resolutions of the United Nations  which call for the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan so that the Afghan people may again exercise their right of self-determination  regain their freedom and establish the political system of their choice.147.	The situation in South Africa is deteriorating because there is increasing ferocity and persecution of the black majority on the part of the racist regime of Pretoria. The State of Bahrain reaffirms its support for the legitimate struggle of the black majority against the apartheid regime  which is contrary to all moral values.147; The South African regime still adheres to its inflexible policy on the Namibian question. We very much regret that the Government of South Africa did not cooperate with the Secretary-General of the United Nations during his recent visit to Pretoria last August  in accordance with Security Council resolution 532 (1983)  to undertake consultations with the parties concerned with a view to securing the speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia.148.	As regards the question of Cyprus  we reaffirm the importance of finding a peaceful solution to this question  and we hail the efforts made by the Secretary-General in this respect.149.	We also welcome the efforts undertaken to solve peacefully the dispute between North Korea and South Korea through negotiations without pre-conditions and respect for the will of the Korean people to establish peace and security within a unified State.150.	Some cautious optimism appears in the 1983 annual report of IMF regarding the world economic situation after the period of economic recession affecting most countries of the world. However  the report expresses clear concern over customs barriers and restrictions imposed on the products of developing countries. Those countries have learned from past experience  either during the period of colonialism or afterwards  that economic problems cannot be solved except by restructuring the world economic order itself. Such a change is urgently needed  to permit the establishment of an economic order based on justice  interdependence and collective partnership.151.	Most international economic conferences since the beginning of the 1970s have ended in failure because of the continued adherence of the rich industrialized countries to their inflexible policies and because no serious attention has been paid to the principle of international interdependence  which has started gaining favour in the world because of changes in world economic and political relations. Thus the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  was not able to achieve positive results because of the policies of some rich industrialized countries.152.	As a result of the changes in international relations over the last three decades  the industrialized countries should not continue to view the developing countries as easy markets for their manufactured goods and products. They should consider them as partners in a world economic order requiring co-operation and interdependence among all States. We therefore appeal to the industrialized countries not to put obstacles in the way of establishing the new international economic order.153.	Most questions addressed by the United Nations and its specialized agencies are of a global nature  since in one form or another they touch on human life as a wholeâwhether in the political  economic or social fields. The global nature of current problems should bring nations closer together for their common good  rather than separate them as is now the case.154.	My country's delegation hopes that suitable resolutions will be adopted at this session to deal with current world problems and satisfy the aspirations of the peoples of the world. It gives me pleasure to repeat that the Government and people of Bahrain are fully ready to act with other nations and States Members of the international Organization in achieving justice  co-operation and peace in the world so that future generations may live in peace and happiness  in conformity with the lofty principles and goals of the Charter of the United Nations. 155.

"16",747,"BHS",38,1983,"ï»¿48.	Sir  it is a pleasure for me  on behalf of the Bahamian delegation  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly  You assume office with high qualifications and  with the acquired experience and stature you possess  you are specially equipped to guide the affairs of the Assembly at this troubled time. I wish you success in this demanding office and pledge the support of my delegation to you and to your colleagues in the General Committee  hoping for a realistically productive thirty- eighth session.49.	On behalf of my delegation  I wish also to express deep gratitude to the delegations which supported our candidacy for the presidency of the General Assembly.50.	I should like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  of Hungary  who presided over the thirty-seventh session. We are indebted to him for the tact  skill  patience and tolerance with which he carried out the functions of his office.51.	I take this opportunity to express the profound appreciation of my delegation and of the Government of the Bahamas for the unceasing efforts the Secretary- General has made in the pursuit of the goals and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. Within the limits imposed upon him by institutional restraints  as well as in the absence of either the will or desire of some States to reach the consensus which  I believe  the peoples of the world want in the pursuit of peace  economic security  self-determination and racial dignity  he has preserved the integrity of his office and the credibility of the Organization.52.	I note with great pleasure the admission of Saint Christopher and Nevis to this family of nations. The Bahamas and Saint Christopher and Nevis have been closely associated for a long time. In addition to common historical links and cultural associations  institutionally we have both been nurtured in the democratic tradition. We also share the common bond of membership of the Caribbean Community.53.	It is exactly 10 years ago that the Bahamas was welcomed as a Member of this esteemed international Organization. At that time there were 132 Members. Today the membership of Saint Christopher and Nevis brings the total membership to 158. To our mind  this quantum leap bears evidence of the truism that man should be the master of his own destiny and is testimony to the efforts of the Organization in the pursuit of decolonization.54.	There exist still those who think that the United Nations no longer fulfils its purposes and principles and should therefore not exist at all.55.	This institution was created by men of wisdom 38 years ago. That it has not succeeded in all of its tasks is true; that it has failed in its task is untrue. The Organization's effectiveness on certain issues is circumscribed when those issues are perceived in the eyes of the major Powers to be secondary to their own interest. None the less  the Bahamas reaffirms its support for the United Nations system  which to us represents the only realizable hope for just solutions to the problems which mankind faces today and a court of appeal for the State victim of aggression in whatever form it takes. We must discover a method whereby the Organization could more effectively and efficiently discharge its mandate  especially during the annual sessions of the General Assembly when an enormous amount of time could be more wisely utilized.56.	The problems of developing island countries are peculiar and demand special attention as these countries forge along the paths to development. Generally speaking  they are monocultural with subsidiary sources of income. They are archipelagos or clusters of islands  a condition which imposes severe cost implications for transportation  communication between islands and duplication that slow down the pace of sustained economic growth and development. In addition  they are particularly prone to natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes and suffer from economic factors outside their control.57.	In recent years  however  more focus has been given to the special circumstances of small developing island countries. The Assembly has been in the forefront of the movement to bring about an awareness in the international community of the severe restrictions which are placed on such countries. The efforts of other international organizations  such as UNCTAD  the Commonwealth  the Organization of American States and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  have had a positive effect on the identification of the problems. I wish to pay a tribute to the untiring efforts of the Non-Aligned Movement  which in September this year held a meeting of experts in Grenada  the outcome of which  we hope  will highlight the type of assistance which small developing island States would wish from this Organization and its Members.58.	Tourism is the principal industry in the Bahamas and the foundation of our national economy. Unhindered and unimpeded freedom of travel in a non-discriminatory manner  whether by means of aircraft or by boat  is an indispensable element of a successful tourist industry. We attach great importance to this freedom. It was therefore with profound regret that we learned of the downing of a Korean commercial passenger airliner with the tragic loss of so many lives. We believe that this act was unnecessary. We offer the condolences and sympathy of the Bahamian people to the families of the victims. We join with others who have voiced their condemnation of those responsible.59.	At the preceding session  in the general debate I stated that the problem of the control of drugs represented one of the primary social problems facing the Bahamas. We are not a producer of drugs but  positioned as we are between the suppliers and the consumers  we have been used by outside forces as a transit point for drugs destined for the North American market. We are appreciative of the work of the Commission on Narcotics Drugs  of which we are a member and to which we pledge our co winning support.60.	I wish to reiterate that what is urgently needed to combat this problem is a higher degree of international cc-operation between the producer States  the consumer States and the transit States.61.	Last March the Bahamas hosted the first Seminar on Illicit Drug Traffic for Law Enforcement Officers of the Anglophone Caribbean. This Seminar  which had wide participation  was co-ordinated by the Division of Narcotic Drugs. One of its recommendations reads as follows:""The drug traffic is clearly now an international phenomenon  sharing many characteristics with the internationally recognized crimes of slavery and piracy. There seems to be grounds for the formal recognition of drug trafficking as an 'international crime'. Governments might request the United Nations to advise on the implications of such formal recognition of the gravity of offences related to drug trafficking and on the extent to which this recognition might assist in developing countermeasures to this traffic.""62.	The Bahamas strongly endorses the recommendations of the Seminar and hopes that they will materialize into constructive measures of activity by the Organization  for we are convinced that the internationalization and co-ordination of approaches to the problems of drug trafficking would lead to positive results.63.	The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was opened for signature at Montego Bay on 10 December last year. One hundred and nineteen countries signed it on that day. Since then  other countries have signed it and yet others  including the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  have ratified it. I urge all States to become party to this Convention  thereby signifying their undertaking to be bound by a universal treaty. We further caution the minority of States contemplating unilateral action in respect of deep sea-bed mining activities that  in our opinion  any such activities conducted outside the framework of the Convention would be contrary to international law.64.	International economic  social and political crises  big-Power rivalries and lack of mutual trust are all responsible for the problems which exist between us.65.	I am afraid that  despite our awareness of the physical destruction and human tragedy that have resulted from wars or conflictsâwhether by primitive  conventional or atomic weaponsâthe majority of States is still opposed to a programme of major disarmament.66.	There is no doubt that all nations consider disarmament as synonymous with peace. Perhaps the difficulty in making progress is that the concept of the words is such that they more often than not elicit theoretical and philosophical posturing on the part of negotiators. Each year Governments make statements concerning the ills of the arms race and representatives in the First Committee deal with various specific resolutions on the question of disarmament  but there is little evidence regarding implementation of measures that would prove the accumulation of arms unnecessary.67.	Despite the fact that Governments are aware that the arms race has resulted in the wastage of valuable resources that could be put to more productive use  there is a great unwillingness to desist from acquiring and developing newer and more sophisticated weapons of destruction.68.	The arms race is the single most crucial problem of today  and thus it behoves us all to work collectively towards significant disarmament measures which will restore the confidence of our peoples in the worth and effectiveness of the United Nations.69.	We have witnessed with frustration the turmoil and agony of countries in Central America. This situation brings home to us in stark fashion the price that is paid when solutions to political  social and economic problems are sought through military means. It is an example of ideological differences being given a higher priority than the interests of people and the lessening of human suffering; it is an example  too  of the negotiations and the mechanisms of the international community that were created to settle differences being prevented from functioning effectively.70.	In Central America the Government of the Bahamas supports all efforts leading to the strengthening of democracy. We support  too  efforts at reform which seek to redress decades of inequity and indifference. The Bahamas supports moves towards dialogue and negotiations  both among the countries of the area and among groups within each country  without unnecessary terms and conditions. The Bahamas recognizes the positive steps taken by various countries in attempting to resolve these difficulties. Among those countries are the members of the Contadora Group  which deserves the support and encouragement of the international community.71.	In the Middle East the issues continue to be volatile  complex and frustrating  with undiminished danger to world security. We hope that the present initiatives and negotiations in Lebanon will prove successful  and today  as in the past  the Bahamas urges all parties concerned to recognize fully their responsibility to make every effort and explore every avenue which can lead to a peaceful and permanent solution to long-standing differences.72.	As we have stated in this forum previously with respect to the Arab-Israeli conflict  we wish to emphasize concerning Lebanon that the Bahamas strongly supports the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of that country  and we firmly endorse the Security Council's call for the withdrawal of Israel from Lebanon. Indeed  no foreign forces should remain without the full consent of the Government of Lebanon.73.	Other areas of conflict continue to affect the peace and security of the international community. Situations in Cyprus  Poland  Cambodia  Afghanistan and Chad and the war between Iraq and Iran continue to occupy our attention and tax the efforts of this Organization and others acting in the cause of peace. The Bahamas takes the view that peace  human freedom and social and economic development are indivisible and inseparable  and that progress in any one area cannot long outpace progress in the others without serious consequences resulting.74.	This session is convened at a time when the world economic situation continues to deteriorate. The present economic crisis is perhaps the most acute since the t930s. The crisis does not seem to be simply a cyclical phenomenon  but more a symptom of deep-rooted structural imbalances and disequilibrium. The worst victims are the developing countries  and particularly the least developed countries. Prospects for most countries continue to look grim as those countries continue to experience serious balance-of-payments and debt-servicing problems  further erosion of the terms of trade  and acute poverty  hunger and malnutrition.75.	The Bahamas notes the global character of these problems and holds the view that domestic policies alone will be inadequate to counter the problems. The needed action must be global  for the growing interdependence of the world economy has made it imperative that urgent joint action be taken  by both developed and developing countries  for survival.76.	With this in mind  therefore  the Bahamas joins other developing States in expressing profound regret at the very disappointing results which emerged from the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Developing States take this position because of the flexible and realistic strategy which they felt they had arrived at during the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  at New Delhi in March  and at the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  at Buenos Aires in March and April.77.	It is still the hope of many countries that the proposals of the Non-Aligned Conference will be responded to in a positive way by the developed countries in the spirit of compromise and co-operation in which the proposals were made. Particular attention is drawn to the need for a positive political response to the proposal for the launching of global negotiations in two phases.78.	One of the basic objectives of the Charter  and one of the basic obligations of Member States  is the promotion and encouragement of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Bahamas Government has always tried to live up to these international standards. Year after year  we have dedicated ourselves to fight against the evils of racism and prejudice  and we have proclaimed our faith in the inherent dignity and worth of the human person. We are  accordingly  distressed to come to the Assembly once again to voice our disenchantment with the progress made in the area of the eradication of racism and apartheid.79.	South Africa continues to constitute a major area of tension in the world today  threatening international peace and security. The racist minority regime of South Africa continues to oppress the members of the black majority and to prevent them from exercising their inalienable rights as free human beings. The Bahamas condemns the	policy of South Africa and supports military  economic and cultural sanctions against South Africa. The Government of the Bahamas continues to support the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) as the basis for democratic rule in  and the independence of  Namibia. It remains the view of the Bahamas Government that it is not sufficient for the international community simply to recognize that the racial policies of South Africa constitute a threat to international peace and security. What is needed most is broad agreement on a programme of practical steps and measures to be taken to put an end to that threat.80.	I had occasion to state at the thirty-sixth session that:""Nothing in modern world history has affronted the dignity of so many people in the world as the racial policies of the Government of South Africa. The overwhelming majority of the people of the world are at war with the soul of South Africa as it is at present governed. Outside the African continent  there is a perception that in South Africa a white racist minority discriminates against and oppresses a black South African majority. That part of the picture is  to be sure  true  but it is incomplete in so far as it is a perception which does not recognize that apartheid goes beyond discrimination and oppression. For the Government of South Africa  locked as it is in the cocoon of its perversity  apartheid is a religion  the soul of their nation which gives it strength  the psychology of its people which gives them courage and a culture which gives meaning to their existence. We ought also not to underestimate the extent to which the Government of South Africa and the philosophy which it promotes represent an acceptable symbol to powerful ethnic forces in the world which cling to the belief that some men are more equal than others."" I also remarked in connection with the strategy against apartheid  that""Most important of all  we have to destroy the illusion which it is sought to create that South Africa is governed by normal people capable of conventional reason and intelligence and that in the fullness of time their own enlightened self-interest will force change upon them  for it will never happen that way. We ought never to indulge in the self-delusion that there are conventional means by which apartheid will be renounced and abandoned voluntarily by South Africa because that regime will ultimately come to the conclusion that that is the right thing to do.""This South African Government's religion and philosophy can only survive  too  because it has so many friends outside South Africa to give it aid and comfort. The war against apartheid must therefore be intensified outside South Africa against people who are capable of reason and intelligence and who ought to know what enlightened self-interest is.81.	Since the last Assembly session  the Bahamas has become a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We affirm and endorse the principles which guide the direction of the Movement  particularly in the approaches to and strategies for development.82.	The Bahamas adheres to the views on the role of non-alignment expressed in the Political Declaration of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries. The non-aligned countries today represent an overwhelming majority of mankind linked together by a shared perspective that transcends the differences in their social and economic systems. Their common commitment to the promotion of world peace  to the elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism  to the consolidation of the natural independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  and to the social and economic uplifting of their peoples  constitutes an irreversible factor in world history.83.	It therefore follows that since the national goals of all countries are similar  there should be little difficulty in supporting the common cause or principles of the Movement  regardless of the particular ideology of each country.84.	I wish to draw attention to the policy of members of the Non-Aligned Movement on the issue of the new world information and communication order  as referred to in the Political Declaration of the Seventh Conference. We recognize that the present situation in the field of information and communication is largely a legacy of the past and of the continued dominant position of a few transnational news agencies of the North. The transformation into a new world information order will therefore require that the principle of the free flow of information be given its full meaningful and democratic content. This  however  does not mean that the media should come under the control of Governments. That would be intolerable  though clearly they should have an interest in policies of integrity which will ensure honesty in the distribution of news to the public.85.	The Bahamas  as a major tourist destination  conscious of its geographical proximity to the most advanced country in the world  is engaged in a continuous fight to maintain its distinct national identity. We need constantly to fight media-induced problems and values which introduce conflicts and even destabilization into our society.86.	At this very time in my country the grimy hand of the multinational imperialist communications media has clawed at the Bahamas  threatening its peace and stability in what may very well be part of a conspiracy to destabilize the Government of the Bahamas and overthrow it.87.	In a world of cynics  hardened to injustice  the fate of the Government of a country of 200 000 people and the invasion of its sovereignty will go unnoticed. But we are not satisfied that this particular problem has yet reached dimensions necessitating recourse to international attention in this body for relief from the extension of extraterritorial jurisdiction to the Bahamas and from the callous interference in the internal affairs of the Bahamas of multinational news media  disseminating news world-wide.88.	From our perspective  therefore  the new world information order is not an instrument designed to replace the domination of the transnational agencies by establishing national news bureaucracies in a move to restrict press freedom. Rather  we would emphasize it as a move towards more press freedom in the third world. That would really meet the need to inform and to be informed  which is  after all  a fundamental human need.89.	It is a geopolitical fact  recognized in few places apart from the Bahamas  that we occupy a peculiar geographical position in the world  in which our closest neighbour to the south is the Republic of Cuba and our closest neighbour to the north is the United States of America.90.	The people of no country in the world prize their freedom  their independence  their sovereignty  their parliamentary democracy  more fiercely than Bahamians. The legacies of the former colonial slave societies which also evolved as multi-racial societies have implicit in their existence some fundamental cultural contradictions and problems which have yet to be eradicated. The Bahamas is not unique in this; neither is it peculiar to us that our most urgent post-colonial task is the economic and social reconstruction and development of our society. It is therefore to be expected that our priorities must of necessity be somewhat different from the priorities of those countries whose colonial history is different and more remote  or which never really had one.91.	We in the Bahamas hold very strongly to the internationally acclaimed principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. We have neither the means nor the desire to interfere in the domestic affairs of any State  and we deplore efforts by others who attempt to do so. Should it be considered unreasonable  therefore  to ask other States to be similarly guided in their behaviour towards us? I think not.92.	I pose that question because it is a customary principle of international law  an adjunct of sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  that all States are obliged not to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or to attempt to impose their will upon smaller and infinitely weaker States. This obligation refers not only to overt and armed interference  but also to the more subtle aggressive attempts which can have a destabilizing impact on any country.93.	There remain some States in the international community which seek  through their various judicial and economic agencies  to impose their policies  hegemonism and laws upon other sovereign States by aggressively pursuing hostile economic policies towards them. The extraterritorial extension of domestic laws is unacceptable  as it ignores the fundamental principles of international law and the sovereign equality of States as provided for under the Charter of the United Nations. Such acts demonstrate a complete lack of respect for the laws  policies  rights and interests of other States  and have very serious implications for orderly development. This is particularly important in the case of small developing countries  for it undermines social and economic progress and disrupts political stability  all of which are crucial variables in the process of development.94.	All legislation is territorial  and so it must be an act of interference with the authority of another State  and contrary to the comity of nations  for one State to apply its domestic laws outside its own national jurisdiction. This is a clear and unequivocal expression of the territorial principle of national jurisdiction which is provided for under the Charter. Otherwise  the international system guided by the rule of law breaks down  and one State becomes subjugated to another  which has the effect of undermining its existence as an independent  sovereign and territorially integral entity. We therefore object very strongly to attempts by States to export their policies and laws to sovereign States which may have different legal systems and different interests to protect.95.	In conclusion  I wish to state once again in the Assembly that the Bahamas has always considered that the strengthening of the effectiveness of the United Nations is one of the highest tasks of the Member States. For our part  we oppose firmly the growing tendency to withdraw from or bypass the United Nations in seeking solutions to substantive problems. We exhort all Member States  rather  to commit themselves to increasing the effectiveness of the Organization by striving to implement the decisions and resolutions of the Assembly.96.	In this spirit of idealism  I pledge that the Bahamas will do its utmost to assist in promoting the principle that conflicts and disputes must be solved through constructive dialogue and peaceful negotiations  and that in an era of ever greater interdependence we are compelled to cooperate in the search for peace  equal rights  security and progress for all peoples  always remembering the golden rule. "
"17",819,"BLR",38,1983,"ï»¿40. Please accept  Sir  the congratulations of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  together with our best wishes for every success. We thank the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the dignified and responsible manner in which he discharged his functions as President of the previous session.41.	Our delegation welcomes the admission of Saint Christopher and Nevis as a Member of the United Nations.42.	As many preceding speakers have already pointed out  this session of the General Assembly is being held in the context of a difficult international situation. Tensions in the world have reached a very dangerous level  a fact clearly indicated in the statement by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Mr. Yuri Andropov  on 28 September 1983	The aggravation of the world situation is the result of the policy being openly pursued primarily by the United States  and by its closest military and political allies as well  a policy that undermines peace and international security. In their attempts to achieve military superiority for the United States of America over the Soviet Union and  by the same token  for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over the Warsaw Treaty Organization  they are constantly whipping up the arms race  particularly the nuclear arms race. They are engaged in gross interference in the internal affairs of other States  poisoning the political atmosphere by staging acts of provocation  and deliberately impairing the potential of the peoples for economic and social progress. Driven by their imperialist ambitions  they are trying to impose their imperialist will on the world through the use or threat of force  including the threat of nuclear force.43.	The time available for effectively solving the problems of preserving peace and achieving true disarmament is limited and growing ever shorter. In these conditions the United Nations and its Member States cannot simply register these alarming facts; they must act and act decisively and without delay.44.	Are there real possibilities of a radical improvement in the current political situation  of solving the problems created by the imperialists  of a return to the path of detente and co-operation?45.	Yes  there are. Such opportunities are being offered by the Soviet Union and other States of the socialist community  by the members of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries and by the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations. Such opportunities have also been adumbrated in earlier General Assembly resolutions.46.	Let us try to imagine the world as it would be had the constructive proposals of the forces of socialism and peace been implemented and made a reality. Let us try to analyse what is preventing the implementation of those peace initiatives.47.	Turning first to Europe  approximate parity exists between the military potentials of the two social and political systems  though the concentration of combat units and military hardware is 20 times higher than the world average.48.	The Soviet Union  constantly striving for an improvement in the situation on the European continent and for the elimination of the threat of war  is proposing that both medium-range and tactical nuclear-weapon systems in Europe be destroyed or that the deployment in Europe of any new medium-range missile systems be renounced while all existing systems are reduced  by both sides  by approximately two thirds. The Soviet Union is proposing that agreement be reached on parity in both delivery vehiclesâmissiles and aircraftâand their warheads. Finally  the Soviet Union is prepared  if a mutually accepted agreement is reached that includes the non- deployment by the United States of new missiles in Europe  to reduce its medium-range missiles in the European part of the Soviet Union to a number equal to the number of British and French missiles and to eliminate all missiles subject to reduction  including SS-20s. Thus  the Soviet Union would be left in Europe with a smaller number of medium-range missiles than it had in 1976  that is to say  before the modernization of Soviet missiles began.49.	The Soviet Union supports the proposals for nuclear- free zones in northern Europe and in the Balkans and for a 500-600-kilometre-wide zone in Central Europe that would be free of battlefield nuclear weapons. In the area of conventional arms it is seeking a reduction in armed forces and conventional weapons in Central Europe and advocating that their numbers be frozen by the States permanent members of the Security Council and States having military agreements with them.50.	Finally  the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty have proposed to the NATO countries the conclusion of a treaty on the mutual non-use of force and the maintenance of relations of peace  which would have as its centerpiece an undertaking not to be the first to use either nuclear or conventional weapons against each other  that is  not to use any military force against each other.51.	These proposals  if agreed to  would provide ample opportunities for mutually beneficial co-operation by the States and peoples of Europe in all areas and in a climate of lasting peace and reliable security.52.	What are those who oppose such initiatives seeking to attain? They want to divide Europe with a palisade of American missiles. They are preparing to deploy neutron weapons on the continent of Europe and demanding that their NATO allies further increase their military spending. At the same timeâand this is another facet of the monstrous plan designed to hold the States of Western Europe hostage to the United Statesâthe United States of America is forcing them to break off mutually beneficial economic and other ties with the Eastern European States  notwithstanding the fact that Soviet orders alone have been providing employment for no less than one million people in Western Europe. Moreover  the United States is strangling the economies of Western European countries with its high interest rates and an artificially inflated exchange rate for the United States dollar.53.	With regard to missiles in Europe  the United States seems to harbour the illusory hope that somehow it might be possible to force the Soviet Union to end up with zero missiles in exchange for zero reductions on the part of NATO; or  according to the latest United States proposal  to force the Soviet Union to reduce its medium-range missiles and allow new American missiles to be deployed in Europe over and above the present NATO nuclear potential. Such an approach is totally contrary to the principle of undiminished security of other States  as recognized by the United Nations  and the principle of equality and equal security. It should also be emphasized that the American Pershing II and cruise missiles to be deployed in Western Europe are capable of destroying targets throughout the Middle East and over half the African continent  that is to say  they are targeted at several regions of the worldâEurope  the Middle East and Africa.54.	Let us now consider the question of the strategic arms of the United States and the Soviet Union  which are roughly equal although difficult in structure. The Soviet Union has proposed the reduction of such arms by one fourth and  concurrently  the reduction to equal  agreed levels of the aggregate number of nuclear warheads deployed on the remaining delivery vehicles.55.	The proposals put forward by the United States provide for selective reductions whereby the United States would end up with three times as many warheads as the USSR. Such proposals are designed to disrupt the existing structure of Soviet strategic forces.56.	The United States is pursuing the same self-seeking and negative course with regard to all other disarmament issues. It is blocking the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. It is sabotaging the implementation of the United Nations resolutions on the non-first-use of nuclear weapons  a freeze on nuclear capabilities  nuclear disarmament  a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  the renunciation of the production of neutron weapons and of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons and on the preparation of a convention on the elimination of chemical warfare capabilities. It should be noted in this regard that  according to reports in the United States press  the Pentagon already has in its possession enough chemical weapons to destroy the entire population of the Earth 50 times over. The United States is opposing a freeze on and a subsequent reduction of military budgets. The United States is not only increasing its own military expenditures but is also asserting its right to dictate to its allies their levels of military spending. As a result  the aggregate military expenditures of capitalist countries increased seventeen-fold from 1950 to 1982.57.	The United States is attempting to justify its obstructionist stand on arms limitation and genuine disarmament by demagoguery about ""Soviet military superiority""  a supposed ""passivity"" on the part of the United States in the past and the resultant American ""lagging behind"". Even favorably disposed Western analysts have failed  however  to come up with a single instance in the entire post-war history of the Soviet Union's having taken the lead in developing any new kind of arms  thus forcing the United States to take counter- measures. It has always been the other way around  and we should like to point out that in the so-called passive years the United States increased its strategic nuclear potential by a factor of 2.5  developing new kinds of arms and weapons systems  increasing their range and accuracy and multiplying their destructive capabilities many times over. It is also common knowledge that  notwithstanding its mounting propaganda campaign about ""lagging behind""  the United States in effect enjoys an advantage over the Soviet Union in the number of nuclear warheads. As stated by Mr. Romulo  Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines  speaking in the general debate on 26 September   the United States strategic arsenal includes some 9 500 warheads  while the Soviet Union has 7 700. According to his data  the United States has an advantage of 7 000 tactical nuclear weapons. It is also worth recalling that the United States has encircled the Soviet Union with a network of military bases and installations; that since the Second World War it has resorted to military force 260 times to further its foreign policy goals and threatened to use nuclear weapons on 19 occasions  including 4 times against the Soviet Union; and that since 1975 alone it has dispatched its forces abroad in about 50 cases. The United States is building new military bases on foreign soil  expanding existing ones  and sometimes even increasing its payments  as if a higher rent increases the security of the owner of a house who is forced to share it with a sick trespasser who is dangerous to the people around him.58.	It is not concern for international peace and security that motivates the United States. This was acknowledged even by the United States Secretary of Defense  Mr. Weinberger  when he said that much of the energy resources that the United States needs and many strategically important minerals are thousands of miles away from United States shores and that in order to gain access to these resourcesâto be more exact  other peoples' resourcesâthe United States must increase its military and naval might. Thus there is a direct link with the imperialist practice of proclaiming vast regions of the globe ""spheres of United States vital interests"".59.	Is it surprising  then  that the United States is opposing the preparation in the United Nations of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations and that it is unresponsive to the proposal for a treaty between the Warsaw Treaty and NATO countries on the mutual non-use of military force and the maintenance of relations of peace?60.	Let us now consider the question of preventing an arms race in outer space. The earlier Soviet proposals on this subject are well known. The current session has before it a draft treaty on the prohibition of the use of force in outer space and from space against the Earth It has been proposed that agreement should be reached on a comprehensive ban on the testing and deployment of any space-based weapons capable of destroying targets on Earth  in the atmosphere or in outer space  on the elimination of existing anti-satellite systems and on the prohibition of the development of new ones. Meanwhile the USSR has unilaterally assumed the extremely important obligation not to be the first to place any kind of anti-satellite weapons in outer space.61.	What about the position and actions of the United States? They include disruption of Soviet-American talks on banning anti-satellite weapons  opposition to launching talks in the Committee on Disarmament on the prohibition of the placement in outer space of weapons of any kind  the refusal to assume the obligation not to be the first to place anti-satellite weapons in outer space and  at the same time  the implementation of military programmes in outer space and the announcement of a militaristic ""star wars"" programme.62.	In concluding this part of its statement  devoted to the limitation of the arms race and to disarmament  the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR stresses most emphatically the importance and timeliness of the new proposals to condemn nuclear war  and to freeze nuclear arms   submitted by the Soviet Union to the thirty-eighth session.63.	These proposals are a logical extension of the efforts undertaken within the United Nations to save the peoples of the world from the threat of nuclear war.64.	As far back as 1981 the United Nations adopted a Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear Catastrophe. One year later it endorsed the unilaterally assumed obligation of the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and called upon the other nuclear Powers to follow suit. Now the time has come to adopt a declaration condemning nuclear war as the most hideous crime against the peoples and declaring as criminal acts the formulation  propounding  dissemination and propaganda of political and military doctrines and concepts intended to justify the ""legitimacy"" of the first use of nuclear weapons and in general the ""admissibility"" of unleashing nuclear war.65.	Nor can it be denied that if we are seeking nuclear disarmamentâand no one dares to challenge that goal openlyâthen we should start by freezing nuclear weapons and halting  under appropriate verification  the build-up of all components of nuclear arsenals  including all kinds of delivery vehicles and warheads  renouncing the deployment of new kinds and types of such weapons  declaring a moratorium on all nuclear-weapon tests as well as tests of new kinds and types of delivery vehicles  and halting the production of fissionable materials for manufacturing nuclear weapons.66.	That proposal  containing qualitative and quantitative limitations  is addressed to all the nuclear Powers  but the Soviet Union believes that it is possible that initially the United States and the Soviet Union can set a good example for others to follow with an appropriate agreement to freeze their nuclear potentials.67.	We believe that these proposals will enjoy very wide support among States Members of the United Nations. We can and we undoubtedly must solve these problems. Our conviction is based on the success of the Madrid meeting of the States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  where  despite all the tensions in Europe and throughout the world  States with differing social systems still succeeded in finding mutually acceptable agreements on the basis of the principles and provisions of the Helsinki Final Act including agreement to convene the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe.68.	Now let us  in our imagination  turn from continental Europe to other parts of the world.69.	We see that while the Soviet Union is proposing that the Mediterranean be turned into a zone of stable peace and co-operation  that all ships carrying nuclear weapons be withdrawn from that area and that the deployment of nuclear weapons on the territory of non-nuclear Mediterranean countries be renounced  the United States is opposing these measures.70.	The Soviet Union is striving to achieve implementation of the United Nations resolutions on the question of Cyprus and has proposed the convening for this purpose of a representative international conference within the framework of the United Nations  while the United States is blocking the settlement of the situation in Cyprus by opposing the demilitarization of Cyprus and attempting to impose on its people NATO-inspired terms that are incompatible with the independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned policy of that country.71.	Let us now turn to another flashpoint on our planet  the long-suffering Middle East. It is well known that the socialist  Arab  non-aligned and many other States are demanding that Israeli troops be withdrawn from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and are working towards the achievement of a Middle East settlement through political means  ensuring security for all the States and peoples of the region  providing for the exercise of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to statehood and restoring the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon through the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli occupiers from Lebanese soil and the withdrawal of United States and other NATO forces from that country. Socialist and non- aligned States took part in the regional conferences and  in August-September  in the International Conference on the Question of Palestine. They have proposed the convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO].72.	And what is the United States doing about the Middle East problem? It is engaged in ""strategic cooperation"" with the Israeli aggressors  supplying them with modern weapons. It is the United States that nurtured this militaristic State in the Middle East. As a result  Israel's military expenditures amount to 62 per cent of its gross national product  while its external indebtedness exceeds its annual gross national product. The United States has been supporting Israel's aggressive actions against the Arab peoples  defending it in the Security Council against the wrath and the just demands of the international community. As for the PLO  the United States has no other words for it but torrents of malicious insults. The United States not only has been evading a comprehensive and just settlement in the Middle East but alsoâat the very time of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  which it sabotagedâproceeded to overt military actions against the Lebanese  thus making a mockery of its promise to protect them.73.	In the Persian Gulf area  the Soviet Union is proposing that the threat of war be eliminated  that a climate of stability and tranquillity be ensured  that foreign military bases not be established  that no nuclear or any other kind of weapon of mass destruction be deployed  that there be no resort to the use or threat of force against the countries of that region  that the non-aligned status chosen by the Persian Gulf States be respected  that guarantees be provided for the sovereign rights of those States and for the security of the maritime and other communications linking the region with the rest of the world  and that an international agreement to these ends be concluded.74.	And what is the United States doing there? It is arbitrarily  without the consent of the 19 States concerned  busy setting up the CENTCOM command  assigning to it policing functions  including direct military intervention in the internal affairs of others. It is also engaged in demonstrations of military might through the rapid deployment force.75.	As for the Indian Ocean  the Soviet Union has consistently supported the efforts of the States of that region to prepare for and hold an international conference to reach agreement on the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean  and it is in favour of the return of the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia  to Mauritius.76.	Seeking as it does an overall reduction in tensions across the seas and oceans  the USSR has proposed  among other things  that naval activities be restricted on a mutual basis  that naval armaments be limited and reduced  that Soviet and United States missile-carrying submarines be withdrawn from their present vast combat patrol zones and that their navigation range be limited by mutually agreed lines  and that confidence-building measures be extended to the sea and ocean areas; that is  the USSR is working towards transforming the largest part of the world's oceans into a zone of peace.77.	The United States  having unilaterally suspended the Soviet-American negotiations on the limitation and reduction of military activities in the Indian Ocean  is escalating its military activities both in the Indian Ocean and in other maritime areas  consolidating its Diego Garcia base  hindering the convening of a conference to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace and attempting to undermine the very notion of a zone of peace.78.	In Asia and the Far East  the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries support the idea of negotiations to reach agreement on confidence-building measures. The Mongolian People's Republic has proposed the drafting and conclusion of a convention on mutual non-aggression and the non-use of force in relations between the Asian and Pacific States. The countries of Indo-China advocate the establishment of a zone of peace and stability in South-East Asia. Afghanistan is striving for a political settlement in South-West Asia  defending its freedom and independence and supporting the mediation efforts of the personal representative of the Secretary-General to settle the problem of this region on the basis of a cessation of armed or any other kind of interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  with guarantees against any renewal of such interference.79.	On the other hand  the United States is harnessing the countries of this region to its military-strategic plans. For example  Japan has already been assigned the role of ""unsinkable aircraft carrier""  although under its own constitution it is supposed to be a peace-loving and not a militaristic State. Such a policy constitutes an attempt to persuade people to forget the lessons of the past. United States politicians are inviting the States of ASEAN to violate its charter and transform itself from an organ of peaceful co-operation among its member countries to an instrument of interference in the affairs of its neighbours  Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea  which are now engaged in building a new life in keeping with the will of their peoples. The efforts of the United States to destabilize the situation both inside and around Afghanistan are also well known. The United States has not withdrawn its forces from South Korea but is carrying out provocative manoeuvres there  using South Korean aircraft for intelligence purposes against the USSR. It is planning to deploy neutron weapons in the southern part of the Korean peninsula and is doing everything it can to impede the peaceful  democratic reunification of Korea free of any outside interference.80.	Let us now look at the problems of Africa. There the United States has proclaimed itself the ""historical ally"" of the racist regime of South Africa and  moreover  is now pursuing a policy of so-called constructive cooperation with that regime. As a result  decisions of the United Nations  including those of its Security Council  on the struggle against apartheid and on the granting of genuine independence to Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO remain unimplemented. In fact the United States has been acting as an accomplice in the continuing aggressive actions against Angola and other African countries. The report prepared by the Secretary-General after his visit to southern Africa permits the conclusion that the main reason why the South African regime so brazenly disregards United Nations demands to grant independence to Namibia is indeed the comprehensive support which the racist regime in Pretoria receives from the United States. The most recent example of neo- colonialist schemes in Africa is the armed interference of imperialist forces in Chad  inspired and encouraged by the United States and involving other countries  including African countries  in these criminal actions; and there have been military provocations against Libya  continuing interference in the internal affairs of many African countries and military  political and economic pressure brought to bear upon them. In Africa  too  a policy of crude neo-colonialism is being pursued.81.	The same thing is happening in Micronesia  which the United States :s attempting to annex in order to turn it into a militarily strategic springboard  and in Puerto Rico  whose people is being denied the right to self- determination and independence. The same course is being followed by England in the South Atlantic  where it is turning the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands into a military outpost and engaging in colonial piracy in that part of the world.82.	The peoples of the Middle East and Africa are striving to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in those areas while the United States is co-operating with Israel and South Africa in their plans to develop their own nuclear weapons.83.	The United States is also aggravating the situation in Central America and the Caribbean by interfering in the internal affairs of the countries of that region in a cavalier and flagrant manner. Using military threats and pressure  it is trying to deny to the peoples of that region their right to lead a life of their own choosing. The United States is resisting the constructive efforts of those Latin American countries which are anxious to help in seeking mutually acceptable solutions. The Soviet Union  on the other hand  is supporting those efforts and the constructive proposals of Nicaragua and Cuba. The principles of a settlement which they have put forward constitute a good basis for agreement without prejudice to anyone's interests.84.	It is well known that in recent years the United States has made ceaseless efforts to pose as the champion of human rights  a paragon of freedom and democracy and a fighter against international terrorism. The hypocrisy of such claims is self-evident. The United States is not a party to the international covenants on human rights or other basic international legal instruments on human rights and the struggle against racism and apartheid. It is boycotting the efforts of the international community in this area  and that is borne out by its refusal to attend the Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination. The United States continues to harbour Nazi war criminals. It is oppressing its non-white population and  together with other neo- colonialists  is working to resist the wills of other peoples fighting for their freedom  independence and independent development.85.	The United States is rejecting the demands of socialist and developing countries for a restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis  blocking the launching of global negotiations in the United Nations on economic problems and grossly disrupting mutually beneficial ties between States. The United States is trying to bring high-handed economic and political pressure to bear on the socialist States by declaring a crusade against them. It is also threatening the developing nations which have chosen a progressive path of development.86.	Our position on economic problems is predicated on the need to restructure international economic relations on a just  equitable and democratic basis. We are actively fighting imperialist policies which result in the loss by developing nations of more than $200 billion annually through the outflow of capital and profits  debt servicing and inequitable terms of trade.87.	As to the fight against international terrorism  it is appropriate to point out that it is in fact the United States which is doing all it can to support and install dictatorial militarist regimes in various areas  arming mercenaries and sending them to fight against national liberation movements  blocking the preparation of a convention against mercenarism and taking a direct part in repressive military actions in the Middle East  Africa and Latin America.88.	Thus  no matter what aspect of United States policy we turn our attention to  it is perfectly clear that the present United States Administration is opposed to the Charter of the United Nations and the good name of this Organization. It is opposed to most States of the world and to the international community as a whole. It is ignoring the warning of the first President of the United States that a nation which indulges an habitual hatred towards another is a slave to its animosity. Surely that is dangerous to the cause of peace and co-operation.89.	That is why it is essential for peace-loving peoples to step up their efforts to reconcile the course of international developments with the Charter by abiding by it rather than undermining it  in order to respond to the aspirations of the peoples of the world to peace  disarmament  co-operation and social justice. A programme of concrete steps to achieve these goals is contained in the proposals of the socialist States set forth in the Political Declaration adopted by the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty at Prague in January 1983  and in the joint statement issued in Moscow on 28 June at the meeting of State and party leaders of the countries of the socialist community  as well as in the specific proposals submitted by the socialist States to the General Assembly for its consideration at this session. All these proposals confirm the statement by Mr. Yuri Andropov  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR that ""in our time it is precisely socialism that acts as the most consistent defender of sound elements in international relations  of the interests of peace and detente  of the interests of every people and of the whole of mankind"".90.	We greatly appreciate also the position of non- aligned countries and together with them flatly reject the allegation of the United States Department of State that the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi  adopted a declaration which ""fails to reflect the principles of non- alignment"". In our view  both the previous and the New Delhi documents of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  regardless of what may be said about them on behalf of the United States from this rostrum  are permeated with concern for peace and co-operation and reaffirm the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist nature of the Non- Aligned Movement. They open up meaningful opportunities for further concerted efforts on the part of all forces of peace and progress to solve key problems of world politics.91.	The Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic  which at the beginning of 1984 will celebrate the sixty-fifth anniversary of its foundation and in the middle of the year will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the liberation of its territory from the German fascist invaders  is determined to join in the efforts of all peace-loving nations to preserve and strengthen peace on earth  to prevent nuclear catastrophe  to achieve a real breakthrough in disarmament  to improve radically the international situation and to solve all existing problems by political means  through negotiation  on the basis of respect for the sovereign rights and legitimate interests of all peoples.92.	We say this on behalf of a people which lost one fourth of its population and over half of its national wealth in the Second World War; a people which has increased the industrial potential of its republic 33 times in the post-war years as a result of its peaceful  creative work  as compared to the pre-war level  and which is successfully carrying out a programme of economic and social development for the benefit of the working people; a people which is waging an active struggle for peace and taking part in the anti-missile and anti-war movement; a people which gave us the mandate to fight for peace  detente  disarmament and broader co-operation among States; a people which is ready in any circumstances to defend its socialist achievements against any aggressive encroachments or designs. 93.

"18",854,"BLZ",38,1983,"ï»¿1. Belize appears before the Assembly of the representatives of the world's peoples at the beginning of its third year as an independent nation of the Americas. Our independence was achieved through the struggle of our people and the support of the countries represented here. We are responding to the challenge to create a new society based on the structures of democracy that have worked so well for us  and with respect for the principles of international behaviour that have ensured the survival of the United Nations for so many years.2.	As a Central American and Caribbean nation  we rejoice at the election of Mr. Jorge Illueca  the Vice- President of Panama  to preside over the deliberations of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The people of Belize and the people of Panama have a long tradition of association and friendship  and our Governments have forged a relationship of trust  understanding and mutual support that could be a model for regional co-operation.3.	We pay a tribute to the high quality of leadership displayed by Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  who presided over the thirty-seventh session.4.	We rejoice at the accession to independence of our brother Caribbean State of Saint Christopher and Nevisas we welcome yet another member of the Latin American and Caribbean family to the congress of the world.5.	Belize is a small  developing country struggling with its own problems of underdevelopment and nation- building  in the midst of a region suffering the wider consequences of the processes of change  in a world whose chances of survival are lessened progressively with the accelerated development of the increasingly more frightening and more lethal technology of destruction.6.	Even before Belize became independent  we were a founding member of the Caribbean Free Trade Association and later of the Caribbean Community. We are also members of the Commonwealth  the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries and various other regional and international organizations. We have beneficial ties of friendship and co-operation with most of the nations of Europe  Asia  Africa and the Americas. We are recognized by all the nations of the worldâexcept one  Guatemala. It is the unfounded claims to our land by this larger neighbour that prevent good and friendly relations with the Republic of Guatemala and present an obstacle to the full realization of our potential for development and for the betterment of the lot of our peoples.7.	To those who claim our land and cause us needless worry we hold out the hand of friendship. We ask that they respect and recognize our right to determine our future as a nation  free and sovereign  within the land and sea boundaries of Belize  which existed even before the independence of Central America.8.	Guatemala has never possessed any rights over Belize  neither before we became independent nor now that we are independent. It is this intransigence in refusing to recognize the reality of an independent Belize that prevents us from living in peace and co-operation as neighbours should. This reality means that only the representatives of the Belizean people can speak for the nation of Belize. Belize is always willing to enter into peaceful dialogue with Guatemala to work out means of living together in peace and harmony.9.	Persistence in this attitude on Guatemala's part constitutes a threat to peace in the only remaining peaceful part of Central America  a continent afflicted by the violence of strife. We share the anguish of the peoples of the continent and we wish for better times for them and for us. Yet we recognize that Central America is experiencing today the groaning and yearning for a new liberation  after centuries of power and economic imbalances that have left us a doleful legacy of poverty  inequality and unfulfilled expectations.10.	Although Belize shares the history of the region  we have worked hard to spare our people much of the agony of the present crisis. But as the crisis in our region deepens no country is spared the effects. In our own country  refugees from neighbouring States continuously cross our borders in search of a safe haven of peace and stability from the ravages and destruction caused by civil war. Motivated by our human duty  we accept our brother Central Americans in our midst  we make a place for them in our society. Refugees are not isolated in campsand insulated from the mainstream of Belizean society. Our integrative approach is to involve them in the life and the work of the community  to help them contribute to food production and give them some hope for tomorrow. None of us abandons hope that some day they will be able to return to their own lands and their own homes. However  a large influx of new people inevitably causes severe strains on the limited infrastructure of any developing country; and in Belize the strains are placed mostly on areas where we can least afford to be weakened: in employment  in medical and health facilities  in the school system and in housing. If we are to continue and cope effectively with this situation  Belize will require more positive assistance from international agencies.11.	Steps toward peace and political and economic stability in Central America cannot be made by force and military might. Violence does not solve problems. My delegation feels that a political and negotiated solution is the best way to reduce tension and to give back to the people of the region some hope that they can resume a normal life. In this we support the work of the Contadora Group in its difficult task of restoring peace and prosperity to our region.12.	Because our foreign policy promotes non-violence and the peaceful means of settling disputes  we condemn the use of violence  especially the despicable type of violence which killed innocent victims in the commercial airliner destroyed by a military Power. My delegation made our position clear in a letter to the President of the Security council in September' and we reiterate it today.13.	Great rhetoric is expended in the quest for international peace while those with the capacity to ensure a durable peace rush headlong into building up their arsenals for war.14.	The foreign policy of the Government of Belize coincides with the policies of the Non-Aligned Movement. These policies guide us with regard to our legitimate right and aspiration to be free from relations of subordination and dependence and to shape our own destiny according to our own national aims and objectives. They also inform our conduct of international affairs  where the basic rules are respect for the right of peoples to self- determination  non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  non-violence and the peaceful settlement of disputes.15.	With regard to the situation in the Falkland Islands  Belize continues to maintain its well-known policy based on the principles of self-determination  the non-use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes.16.	Belize once more reaffirms its support for our sister Latin American and Caribbean nation of Guyana in its efforts to consolidate its independence and sovereignty and to preserve its territorial integrity in the face of a claim on its territory by its larger neighbour. We note the involvement of the Secretary-General in the search for a peaceful and just settlement of the controversy and join him in urging the maintenance of the most favorable climate for the effective application of the Geneva Agreement .217.	We in Belize cannot ignore the fact that justice and fundamental rights are still being denied to many of the world's peoples. As a nation whose people have historic links with the continent of Africa  we in Belize cannot ignore the suffering of the black majority in southern Africa  where the racist Pretoria rulers cynically pursue their policy of	on the One hand  while on the other hand herding ethnic majorities into bantustans  in mockery of the Africans' real need for freedom and independence. We cannot accept that the independence of Namibia continues to be delayed for reasons totally unrelated to the liberation of that Territory.18.	While recognizing Israel's right to exist as a State  we cannot ignore the plight of the Palestinian people  who are deprived of the exercise of their right to their own homeland on their own territory.19.	We cannot condone a situation that forces the Lebanese people to live in daily fear for their safety  in a virtual state of siege.20.	We join in the universal appeal to the non-aligned States of Iran and Iraq to put an end to war and move positively towards an honourable  just and enduring peace through negotiation.21.	We reiterate the call for a political settlement in Afghanistan  on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops and full respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of that country.22.	Belize has signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in an effort to contribute to the effectiveness of this most important breakthrough in international co-operation for the benefit of mankind. We urge those countries which have not yet done so to sign this historic agreement.23.	While we are deeply concerned over the tensions and confrontations that exist in our region and in other parts of the world  the people of Belize are acutely aware of their own role in advancing the work of continuing creation. To that end we have set as our highest priority the task of putting our own house in order. We do this through the democratic process of our independence Constitution. We put emphasis on obedience to the laws of God and the laws of our nation and we are mindful that by faithfully doing our human duty we guarantee to others their human rights. Every small effort we make in our societies to improve the condition of our citizens has a positive effect on the global effort to realize a fundamental transformation of international structures  to ensure a better life for all the inhabitants of our one world  the planet earth.24.	Economic conditions among our developing countries continue to be subject to the economic fortunes of the developed world in an imbalanced and inequitable ratio. Declining export earnings  high interest rates and the resulting loss of foreign exchange availability have a disastrous effect on the economies of the poorer countries. Added to this  the protectionist policies followed by some developed countries and the many obstacles imposed on our countries to deny us access to international money markets deepen the already acute problems faced by many in the developing world. Much effort has been expended by the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement and various other international and regional groupings of North-South and South-South configurations to come to grips with the solution of pressing problems of economic disparity  but to date no significant progress has been achieved.25.	Countries like Belize continue to hope that these efforts will result not only in academic discussion  but in positive action. In the mean time  we husband our resources and structure our development programmes to achieve the optimum benefits from our productive capacity.26.	We fully recognize the interrelation between our own national policies for development and the existing world situation. Our main export is sugar  an industry which employs some 25 per cent of our working population. With limited access to modest preferential markets  we are forced to sell a significant proportion of our production at a downward fluctuating world market price that often requires increased production for smaller returns.27.	AM of us have a stake in the reversal of the present economic situation. All of us stand to benefit from an early world economic recovery. All of us  developed and developing countries alike  have a reason to stimulate the process of international economic negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order. No one of us can solve these problems in isolation.28.	We have every confidence that the collective interests of the world community dictate the imperative need for it to join together in this task and avail itself of the tremendous capacity of the United Nations to institute the framework of global negotiations for the restructuring of international economic relations.29.	My delegation commends the valiant efforts of the Secretary-General to discharge the awesome functions of his high office. We share the concerns so lucidly expressed in his report on the work of the Organization  issued on 12 September 1983. It is only by ensuring that the United Nations remains the most effective instrument to provide peace  security  stability and justice for all that we can guard against the constant threat of extinction hanging over mankind.30.	But we are confident that where mankind faces the choice of creating or destroying  reason will prevail and life will be triumphant. This is the hope of the United Nations. This is the promise to our children.  "
"19",901,"BOL",38,1983,"ï»¿148.	It is for me a privilege to come to this important podium as the spokesman for the constitutional Government presided over by Mr. Siles Zuazo  a figure of renown in the revolutionary and democratic struggle of Bolivia and Latin America.149.	This year  when we celebrate the bicentenary of Simon Bolivar  it is cause for satisfaction for Bolivia  the favoured daughter of the Liberator  that the General Assembly has elected as its President for this session a worthy representative of Panama  Mr. Jorge Illueca. His election is a well-deserved tribute to him personally and to his experience in the Organization  and it guarantees the success of his important task.150.	I wish to pay my respects and tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Imre Hollai  who was so skilful in leading the proceedings of the previous session.151.	I also wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts for peace and for the defence of the purposes and principles of the United Nations.152.	It is a pleasure for me to welcome the new republic of Saint Christopher and Nevis on the occasion of its entry into the Organization.153.	Bolivia reiterates that its foreign policy is based on observance of the permanent principles that constitute the bases of international law and those contained in the Charter of the United Nations. We confirm our adherence to the principles of the sovereign equality of States  non-interference in internal affairs of other States  the right of peoples to self-determination  respect for human rights  rejection of all forms of racial discrimination and apartheid and of all forms of colonialism  and the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force. Bolivia reaffirms its wish to continue seeking improvement in the machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes among States. We support ideological pluralism  a principle which for us implies an independent non-aligned universalist foreign policy  one devoid of any rigid ideological dogma.154.	Bolivia  because of its position as the central country in South America  has been called ""a land of contacts"" and ""a country of many influences"". Because of this character resulting from its geographic location  Bolivia plays a role of linkage and cohesion in the continent  which makes it important to the processes of regional and sub-regional integration  particularly since it belongs to three water systems: those of the Amazon  the Plata and the Pacific. We can state with conviction  and without fear of being presumptuous or in error  that without the economic development of Bolivia  it will be difficult to make any progress in effective integration between the countries of the Atlantic and those of the Andean group.155.	Regional or bilateral agreements to establish physical links with Pacific ports  covering the aspects of energy  industrial and agricultural development and land transportation  represent for the medium term probably the most crucial set of projects for the whole process of Latin American regional integration. Those projects  especially those relating to the physical infrastructure  will considerably reduce the distances between the Atlantic and the Pacific  thus opening up a new era for Bolivia  since without internal integration the intercontinental links would be precarious.156.	In carrying out those actions  we consider it necessary to restructure or change the scope of the various sub regional agreements and to activate relations with our neighbours in order to make up for lost time  after the extreme isolation into which we were forced by our authoritarian regimes and erratic economic models.157.	We must refer to one of the basic objectives of our foreign policy  which is the return to the sea. Bolivia has not renounced  nor will it ever renounce  its right to have free and sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. With the same firmness with which we defend the principle that the conquest of territory by force grants no rights  we maintain the inalienable right of Bolivia to have a direct and useful outlet to the sea. That is a Bolivian cause  an American cause and a world cause recognized and consistently supported by the international community.158.	On 10 October this year  we in Bolivia will celebrate the first anniversary of our return to a democratic constitutional system. To us that is a signal date because of the deep meaning it has in a world of constant struggle among internal interests and international conflicts. The peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy united the political and social organizations and military sectors committed to the aspirations of the people. That fact is indeed a lesson in political maturity. It is the result of a lengthy and painful struggle and has come about after setbacks which ended with the recognition of the popular will  without turmoil or reprisals  without persecution or banishment. We must also mention the understanding and support that we received from the international community. The definitive consolidation of our democratic process largely depends on that continued support and understanding.159.	The Government of Bolivia is aware of the fact that it cannot ask of its people any more courage or spirit of sacrifice  faced as they are with the most serious economic and social crisis of this century.160.	When the democratic Government came to power a year ago  we found a country in ruins  a chaotic economic situation and a society that was morally undermined by traffic in drugs and corruption. It is enough to say that when the constitutional Government came to power  domestic production had fallen by 10 per cent  inflation amounted to 300 per cent annually  salaries had lost 50 per cent of their purchasing power and businesses were quickly going bankrupt.161.	As far as its external position was concerned  the country was mortgaged and in default  unable to renegotiate its heavy external debt; three fourths of the value of its exports were committed to debt servicing  which drastically reduced its capacity to import even basic materials. That dramatic picture was worsened by the unfortunate fact that the country served as an active centre in the production and traffic of cocaine  activities which damaged the image of the country abroad.162.	At the same time  the international recession hurt the weakened economy of Bolivia and further limited its possibilities for recovery.163.	The most backward sectors  those which had suffered the most from the senseless and mistaken policies of the authoritarian governments  vehemently called for a solution of their pressing problems. Our emerging democracy was faced with a challenge that was almost impossible to meet: a disastrous internal economic situation  a severe international recession and understandable demands from huge social groups.164.	The economic model of authoritarianism had come to an end. One of the basic requirements for its existence was missingâa continuous flow of external financing. The exclusive nature of that model benefited only a minority sector of the population.165.	The economic structure had been distorted  with priority going to activities related to legal and illegal imports and those of commercial and financial intermediary services. The basic sectors  those which produce essential and exportable goods  had lost a significant share of the economy  thus further weakening it. With the abrupt reduction of external financing  the structure of the authoritarian political model came crashing down  thus bringing about the chaotic situation that I have just described.166.	Given that serious situation  the democratic Government decided that drastic changes in our patterns of growth and style of development would have to be made. The economy would have to be directed towards more realism and austerity. A national revolutionary and liberating model of development was advocated not to create a populist system of distribution nor to unleash a vast statism that would sap economic energies to feed a gigantic bureaucracy. It is essentially a mixed economic system  the basic instrument of which is planning for the rigorous establishment of priorities and for the definition of functions to be fulfilled by the public  private and co-operative sectors  by ensuring compatibility of investments needed for development and income distribution.167.	The first acts of the democratic Government reflect the intention of this development policy. Indeed  it prohibited all imports which were not strictly essential; it established a realistic exchange rate and set up exchange controls that allowed for foreign exchange to be made available only for essential purposes.168.	The Government's annual programme began to bear fruit. There was a gradual resumption of economic activity  the rates of dismissal from government employment were stabilized  businesses ceased falling into bankruptcy and inflation decreased. The external debt was renegotiated with some brother countries in a satisfactory manner. Supplies became normalized and it was obvious that the real salaries of the majority of the population were rising.169.	The indicators during the first semester of 1983 were encouraging: the rate of inflation had declined to less than half the level of 1982. Industrial production showed clear signs of expansion. The external sector was beginning to function smoothly to such an extent that we could see that by the end of the year there would be an increase in international reserves.170.	That encouraging beginning of our recovery was cut off by major natural disasters which hit the country. Indeed  floods in the east and a terrible drought in the west ruined the plans and the programme of the Government. To illustrate the seriousness of the damage  I shall just mention that agricultural production will fall by 25 per cent in 1983. A decline of that magnitude means not only that there will be a serious disturbance in our socio-economic operations  but also that there will be widespread famine and great sacrifices for a people who have risked everything for its freedom.171.	Natural disasters have affected more than 1.6 million people  that is  25 per cent of our population. The losses we have suffered amount to approximately $900 million  an amount which equals our annual exports.172.	In a dismal turn of fate  Bolivian democracy is undergoing a very difficult test. The assistance of the international community  together with the strength of a people that has long known how to overcome adversity  a people that well understands the meaning of determining its own future  will allow the democratic Government to face the crisis with solid backing.173.	In this context  we wish to emphasize the initiatives of the Secretary-General to co-operate with us in overcoming those disasters  as well as the co-operation of several Members of the Organization which did not hesitate to lend us a hand in adversity. Our gratitude goes to all of them.174.	Bolivia has always been generous and has not hesitated to co-operate in many causes when our cooperation has been sought. Suffice it to recall our contributions to the success of the cause of world democracy when we sold our tin and other strategic raw materials at low prices during the Second World War.175.	For our State? the United Nations provides a valid forum in the continuous search for shared solutions. The developing countries firmly hope that the issues dealt with here will be given practical effect by the measures which are adopted.176.	We hope that problems so vital for mankind as the arms race and world peace will be discussed with the responsibility they require  since the future of the planet is at stake.177.	Our presence in this forum is a commitment to our peoples  a serious commitment to offer new hope to mankind  which is discouraged when it sees that peaceful understanding among nations is still far from being achieved and that the arms build-up process continues to be completely irrational  since existing arsenals have the military potential to ensure the destruction of mankind several times over  while in our streets the misery of outstretched hands and sick and ill-clad citizens increases.178.	We come from peoples which urgently need to see honest concern for their destiny  apart from any collaboration by special interests in dealings which compromise our future. We believe that there is still time to achieve a dialogue that will show mature understanding of and respect for our national dignity  our national characteristics and our forms of government  arrived at with freedom and legitimacy. Anywhere in the world where there is the will on the part of the people  expressed through mechanisms of participation  citizen turn-out and the need to consolidate and strengthen political systems which respect the fundamental rights of man  there States must undertake joint efforts to support with respect the f*3ily struggle of our peoples to make our societies expressions of dignity  freedom and democracy.179.	It is with deep concern that we see the world today facing an arms race which is alarming not only because of its destructive power but also because of the waste of resources it represents. These resources of approximately $800 billion could be used to alleviate the social and economic problems of mankind.180.	The military expenditures of underdeveloped countries total 16 per cent of world military expenditures  while 5.9 per cent of the gross domestic product of the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America goes to military expenditures  whereas only 1 per cent is devoted to public health and 2.8 per cent to education. The fact that countries spend on their arms race the equivalent of the annual budget of UNICEF in a mere five hours is reason for deep concern and reflection.181.	We therefore believe that the only way for mankind to ensure its survival is to abide by the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and those supported by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.182.	That is why we support all United Nations activities to curb the arms race  thus freeing resources for effective international financial co-operation leading to a substantial transfer of funds to the peoples of the third world.183.	Bolivia follows with deep concern the crisis in Central America. The escalation of violence and its devastating effects on the population are a serious problem for the entire region. We maintain that the countries of the area  like all States of the world  have the right to act with sovereignty  without interference from other States  within the framework of non-interference in internal affairs and the principles of self-determination of peoples.184.	Bolivia expresses its solidarity with the people and Government of Nicaragua. It calls for the cessation of all foreign acts of harassment and hopes that its national liberating and non-aligned revolution will be consolidated and strengthened in a democracy reflecting the legitimate aspirations of the Nicaraguan peopleâin other words  with ideological and political pluralism.185.	We support the actions of the Contadora Group  and we are certain that those efforts will open up prospects of a political solution through peaceful means acceptable to all the parties concerned.186.	We reaffirm our support for the process of decolonization  which must continue until the final elimination of this practice. In this context  Bolivia has repeatedly expressed its support for the Argentine Republic's demand that the Malvinas Islands be returned to its sovereignty. We call on the countries concerned to abide by the resolutions of the United Nations and resume negotiations on a settlement of the dispute. We also express our concern over the growing militarization of that area.187.	We categorically reject apartheid and all forms of racial discrimination  which offend human dignity. Bolivia reaffirms its support for the various resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject.188.	Bolivia defends the sovereignty of States and the right of peoples to self-determination. Consequently  we support the Secretary-General's efforts to bring about a just and permanent settlement of the crises in Kampuchea  Cyprus and Afghanistan.189.	With reference to the problem of Palestine  we support all actions by the United Nations to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East. We reaffirm that territorial conquest is inadmissible from any standpoint  and therefore we appeal to Israel to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories.190.	In the certainty that peace is possible only through observance of the principles embodied in the Charter  Bolivia urges the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon  as a way of guaranteeing the independence and sovereignty of that country.191.	We wish to emphasize our concern over the war between Iran and Iraq and join in the requests to both parties to put an end to the conflict.192.	Bolivia supports the process leading to the independence of Namibia within the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and considers that Walvis Bay is an integral part of that territory.193.	With regard to the serious problem of drug trafficking  we must honestly state that bilateral efforts are very limited in scope. The levels of production  the distribution networks and the economic power this traffic entails demand agreements of greater scope and effectiveness. Thus  we advocate multilateral agreements among countries which produce coca and/or cocaine and countries affected by the consumption of their products. Only by a joint effort based on true political will shall we be able to attack a problem which could become uncontrollable even for the most powerful countries.194.	The people of Bolivia  which has lived through the tragedy of dictatorship  repression and the trampling of the most basic human rights  has in this last year experienced a total change in this area  a change which reflects full respect for human dignity and absolute freedom for the Bolivian citizen today  who is protected not only by an internal legal structure  but also by international legal instruments.195.	Since 10 October 1982  Bolivia has acceded to all human rights instruments deposited at the United Nations.196.	We support all actions of the Organization and all efforts of the Governments represented here aimed at alleviating grievous situations such as violations of human rights which unfortunately still exist in many places in the world.197.	The crisis in Latin America is of such dramatic proportions that the President of the World Bank himself has just said that the debt of the third world is a time bomb.198.	This situation implies serious risks to the stability and social peace of our nations. We have not made sufficient progress to change the causes of this imbalance threatening to destroy the productive sector of Latin America.199.	Actually  one might even say that in some circles the Latin American crisis is not perceived as a risk in relations between industrialized countries and poor nations  but rather as an opportunity to assert the dependent and marginal nature of its inclusion in the international economy.200.	In fact the scope of the economic problems in Latin America has severely weakened its international presence  a situation which is taken undue advantage of by transnational banks and corporations  whose motives are in no way guided by a long-term view of the situation required in North-South relations at this crucial juncture.201.	Some time ago  economists coined a new word to describe a phenomenon which escaped traditional definition  and that was the beginning of the term ""stagnation""  which brought together the elements of stagnation and inflation which were  up to then  considered opposed to each other. Today  to describe the Latin American reality  one would have to coin a new term  ""reflections""  to define economic recession which together with inflation undermines the economic and social structure of Latin America.202.	What is more  the actors and the parameters in international economic relations have changed. The transnational private banks are now at the centre of everything and have become the protagonists  following the curious process which came after the oil crisis and the recycling of the financial resources which became known as petrodollars.203.	This change has brought about such a gap that transnational banking has become a ""bankocracy"" which views the world only through impersonal numbers and devalued the very presence of the nation State in countries of the North and even more so in countries of the South.204.	In order to resolve this problem  Governments and international agencies must reassess the role which this ""bankocracy"" tries to monopolize.205.	A political dialogue is necessary at government level between industrialized nations and developing countries  in order to examine and resolve with an eye to the future and with authority  the problems of commercial treatment  protectionism and the renegotiation of the external debt of the third world. We cannot continue on this unbalanced  if not erratic  course of recent times. The struggle between Governments and transnational banking should not only be limited to analysis of amounts  terms and rates; there must be political agreement among nation-States of the North and South to fix parameters for specific negotiations.206.	Bolivia attaches priority to the North-South global negotiations and considers that the United Nations is the most appropriate forum for that dialogue.207.	The constitutional President of my country  Mr. Sites Zuazo  when he was Vice-President of the Republic  came to the General Assembly in 1952 as head of the Bolivian delegation at the seventh session  and he stated in this same Hall:""it is disquieting to consider the tremendous power and correspondingly great responsibility of the great Powers which  constrained as they are to proceed in accordance with a rigid pattern in keeping with their domestic policies  have been unable to lay the foundation for a stable peace which would enable their peoples and the peoples everywhere to live in the hope of a better world."" He continued:""Our emotion becomes anxiety when  as the representatives of small nations  we realize that we can contribute very little  indeed almost nothing  to the elimination of the conflicts among the great Powers. Yet  at the same time  we understand that it is our duty to co-operate constructively in the work of the United Nations  which seeks to build good-neighbourly relations"". Despite the 31 years that have elapsed  that message is still valid  and today our peoples feel the same anxiety and the same hope of achieving a more just world. Today as then  Bolivia reiterates its trust that the efforts of the United Nations will secure peaceful co-existence for the human race. "
"20",948,"BRA",38,1983,"ï»¿ 1.	It is with great pleasure  Sir  that I congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. This choice does justice to the services you have rendered to the United Nations. I am certain that thanks to your professional and personal qualities our work will conducted in a most able and competent manner.2.	At the same time  I wish to express my Government's recognition of the solid and productive work done by your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  in presiding over the thirty-seventh session.3.	I greet you as a representative of a Latin American nation in the year in which we commemorate the bicentennial of Simon Bolivar. It is both just and gratifying for us to pay homage to the Liberator  whose ideals should be recalled at this moment when Latin America must give renewed proof of its historic commitment to peace and to the causes of concord  progress and dialogue. In this context  allow me to stress the important contributions made by your country  Panama  at the international level.4.	I wish also to congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission to membership in the United Nations. We extend our best wishes to the new Member State for a future of peace and prosperity.5.	The general debate traditionally gives us the task of presenting an assessment of the international situation  and this makes it essential for us to reflect upon what is today an unprecedented state of crisis.6.	At the last session the unparalleled seriousness of the international situation brought  for the first time  a head of State of my country to the General Assembly. On that occasion  President Joao Figueiredo gave a much-needed warning about the risks and dangers that threaten the very existence of international society.7.	In the face of a situation that evoked dark memories of the crisis of the 1930s  the head of the Brazilian Government made a vehement appeal that we once again combine our efforts in the task of building peace and making a fresh start on international co-operation ft development. I am certain that President Figueiredo expressed hopes and concerns shared by the vast majority of peoples and nations.8.	In the past 12 months  however  our reserves of faith and confidence have been harshly tested. In his first report to the Assembly  the Secretary-General warned that we were ""perilously near to a new international anarchy"". Despite the seriousness of these words  little has been done to relieve the extraordinary tensions that affect us all at both the political and the economic level.9.	The fact of the matter is that tensions are growing  trade and the economy languish in a cycle of depression  and the recovery of some coincides with worsening difficulties for others. Misery and disorder prevail; the nuclear arms race prospers; and the powerful seem reluctant to seek moderation and dialogue.10.	The thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly is being held under the negative sign of an organic and lasting crisis that demands structural solutions. It should be recalled that the word ""crisis"" comes from a Sanskrit root that also means ""to clean""  ""to untangle""  ""to purify"". At its very roots  then  crisis is an invitation to purification and renewal. It behaves us all to reach decisions that will lead to evolution without rupture  to change within a context of order. International order is based upon an adequate understanding of the different needs of each nation  and the achievement of such an understanding is precisely the role of the United Nations as an institution dedicated to the democratic and egalitarian coexistence of States.11.	While calling to mind the obvious imperfections of the international order  Brazil is not departing from its traditional policy of moderation and balance  inspired by the pluralistic background of its national society. Brazil is both a Western and a third-world country  with a foreign policy that reflects internationally the invaluable wealth of our historical experience. As inheritors of different cultures  we have a natural and deep-rooted respect for diversityâan indispensable condition for harmony.12.	In the political sphere  many years have elapsed without a single truly significant multilateral success   without a single solution to any important question: to 3 Middle East  Central America  southern Africa  South-east Asia  Afghanistan  the Malvinas  strategic and medium-range nuclear missiesâthe list is long.13.	When positions of strength  such as that of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan  seem to become consolidated instead of giving way to justice and reason  it is the international system as a whole that deteriorates. Likewise  the incident that led to the destruction of a South Korean commercial airliner by Soviet aircraft  with the unpardonable loss of innocent lives  is a cause of acute concern and condemnation. The principle of rejection of the use of forceâone of the essential foundations of the Organizationâadmits of no devious application in any areas of tension.14.	With respect to the problems affecting Central America  the Brazilian position is clear and known to all. The basic principles of self-determination and noninterference in the affairs of each country must be applied in this context. We favor a diplomatic and negotiated handling of the tensions so that a climate of understanding may be created  in lieu of confrontation and ideological polarization  and so that the process of transferring global tensions to that area may come to an end.15.	We have confidence in the spirit of responsibility and independence of the Central American countries. We have confidence in democracy and pluralism  not only as a system of internal coexistence but also as a norm of coexistence of countries. We hope that in Central America no nation will become a satellite or an instrument of any other.16.	However  we should not restrict ourselves to the current aspects of the Central American crisis. The real problems will not be solved until the basic structural deficienciesâdecades or even centuries of unending frustration and blatant internal and external imbalances- have been overcome. We believe that a serious and concentrated effort of international co-operation must be undertaken  particularly in socio-economic terms  with the aim of effectively eradicating the chronic problems that beset Central America. 17.	In Latin America  practical actions towards peaceful solutions of controversies and respect for the basic principles of international law are deeply rooted. For that reason  Latin Americaâacting particularly through the nations belonging to the Contadora Groupâis in the best position  through proximity and cultural affinity  to make a valuable contribution towards working out a peaceful solution to the problems of Central America. We should all give our support to the serious efforts made in this context  which give the greatest hope of a positive and diplomatic approach to this grave situation.18.	The current difficulties cannot be isolated from the extended context of the international crisis we are undergoing. The Central American problem cannot be reduced to ideological confrontation. Nor is it possible to remove its evils by force. Further to initiatives taken to reduce tensions  the solution to the problems of the region clearly calls for efforts on the part of each nation to demonstrate that it is not a danger to the security of its neighbors. Experience has taught us that polarization does not favor lasting solutions. In the case of Central America  the small nations would be the major victims of an undesirable radicalization of the situation. There again  it is absolutely essential to re-establish a climate of confidence conducive to dialogue.19.	The fundamental principles which orient Brazilian foreign policy are identical with those governing the best traditions of Latin American diplomatic action. Brazil reaffirms its immutable resolve to strengthen its relationship with all its neighbors  on the basis of solidarity and co-operation  equal to equal. Mutual respect  seeking for legitimate grounds of agreement  and strict adherence to the rules of law and good neighborliness  in practice as well as in theory  are the best patterns for international comportment. In this regard  the Brazilian Government reiterates its support for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 502 (1982)  on the issue of the Malvinas. The role that the United Nations can and should play in seeking a peaceful and negotiated solution for this question  which closely affects the Latin American countries  is of fundamental importance. In this respect  Brazil reaffirms its support for Argentina's rights of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands and expresses its growing concern over any militarization of that area. It is the position of Brazil that the South Atlantic must remain an area of peace and harmony.20.	I cannot fail to express the anxiety that we feel before the picture of insecurity and violence in Lebanon  a nation so often victimized by aggression. It is urgent to stop this new escalation of violence. I reaffirm Brazil's determination in favor of preserving the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country  whose sons have contributed so much to the progress of Brazil.21.	It is increasingly urgent to implement the United Nations resolutions which express an international consensus in favor of a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the successive crises in the Middle East. My Government firmly adheres to the terms of those resolutions and vehemently condemns the policy of apartheid that has hampered negotiations in that region. We must insist upon justice prevailing  upon the evacuation of territory held by force  upon the implementation of the rights of the Palestinian people  upon the creation of conditions that will make it possible for all States in that region to live in peace within their own frontiers.22.	As a country dedicated to the ideals of social and racial harmony  Brazil reiterates its emphatic condemnation of the institutionalized practice of racism that characterizes the regime of South Africa. The policy adopted by Pretoria feeds the hotbeds of tension in southern Africa and is a disservice even to the ideals and interests of the West. The military incursions into Angola  Mozambique and Lesotho must end. The illegal occupation of Namibia  whose independence is being delayed by the intransigence of South Africa  must urgently cease. There is no pretext to justify evading the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).23.	On the other hand  my Government wishes to congratulate the Secretary-General on his efforts to fulfill the mandate received from the Security Council to carry on consultations with the aim of finding a solution to this grave problem.24.	It is the task of our generation not only to reconstruct a world in crisis  but  above all else  to prevent its destruction. As President Figueiredo stated at the thirty- seventh session:""There is no futureânor can there possibly be oneâin that sad  unacceptable substitute for peace which is the balance of terror. We cannot persist in the illusion that world harmony can be founded on an excess capacity for destruction.â25.	The desire for absolute security on the part of one State constitutes a threat of absolute insecurity for all others. Peace will not result from the multiplication of arsenals. It is urgent to seek objective understanding  to create a minimum of mutual confidence and information  and to recreate the mechanisms of the dialogue to reduce tensions  opportunities for misunderstandings and risks of incidents.26.	The United Nations cannot be kept out of the truly important negotiations on disarmament. It is understandable that any concessions in this field must be extremely complex. But whatever affects all must be considered by all. Realism should not lead us to forget that the balanced use of political intelligence is  in the end  more powerful than the unilateral use of force.27.	It is alarming to note that  in 1983 alone  the resources spent on weapons came to $800 billion  which is more than the total of the foreign debt of the developing countries. That figure is enough to make us understand the magnitude of the challenge which we must face.28.	On 16 May 1975  Brazil acceded to the Antarctic Treaty. Ever since then  Brazil has followed a programme which is compatible with its economic possibilities and entirely geared to the development of scientific research. Our decision to participate fully in the Antarctic Treaty is also based on the fact that this document is the only legal instrument applicable to the sixth continent. It can be said that this Treaty has brought about a new objective juridical situation.29.	On 12 September of this year  the consultative parties to the Treaty  meeting at Canberra  recognized Brazil as a consultative party. In taking on this responsibility  Brazil reaffirms its adherence to the principles of peace  co-operation and freedom of scientific investigation enshrined in the Treaty and in the recommendations adopted over a period of more than 20 years by the consultative parties.30.	The current recession is the longest and possibly the most serious contraction of economic activity in the past 50 years. It is no longer possible to cherish the illusion that this is a passing crisis. Its deep-rooted causes are to be found in the very structure of international relationships  as demonstrated by the global dimensions of the crisis.31.	Despite the depth and extent of the crisis  precious opportunities have recently been lost to halt the process of deterioration  which is now accelerating. Ever since the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  held at Cancun in 1981  the North-South dialogue has been losing ground. The crisis has followed its painful path from the commercial to the financial  bearing living witness to the interaction among the many aspects of the world economic system and to the fragility of the mechanisms of multilateral co-operation.32.	The total foreign debt of the developing countries is quickly approaching the trillion-dollar mark. The rates of growth of such debt  pushed upwards by absurdly high levels of interest  are far higher than the growth rates of any country in the world. They are even higher than the most outstanding rates of growth achieved during the most favorable periods by the countries which developed most rapidly. What is unbearable today will be considerably worse tomorrow.33.	International trade  until recently the great lever of progress for North and South alike  has entered a period of stagnation and retrocession  asphyxiated by growing protectionist barriersâan inadequate response to the problems of recession and unemploymentâand also by the burden of foreign debtâwhich together restrict to an unbearable extent the import capacity of the debtor countries  thus making it impossible for them to sustain the levels of economic activity needed to meet the requirements of their peoples and to generate the very resources necessary to meet their commitments.34.	The international community needs innovative and effective proposals  but it is still operating with outdated conceptual and institutional instruments  which can only provide standardized and mechanically applied responses. That is the dominant intellectual response  but at the factual level there is just as much frustration: there is more and more protectionism at a time when increased foreign trade is more necessary than ever; financial burdens are increasing when it is absolutely necessary to reduce them; lending capacity is contracting when its growth is a basic requirement; recessive policies are proliferating at a time when development is more necessary than ever.35.	Last June  the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was the most remarkable demonstration of the constant frustration that has marked multilateral economic negotiations. At the start of the meeting  which was held at Belgradeâfor which the developing countries made careful preparationsâI stated that the international community could not afford a further failure  and that a wide-ranging co-operative effort between the North and the South should be launched as matter of urgency. Unfortunately  the moderate and constructive attitude taken by the developing countries failed to induce the developed countries to adopt a more flexible position. From Cancun to Belgrade  both the North and the South lost precious opportunities for dialogue and understanding  and at this moment  all that is left to the international economy is an uncertain and risky gamble on the results of emergency measures that were adopted to solve problems which  by their very nature  are structural and lasting.36.	In the face of such instability and uncertainty  would not this be the moment for the international community to think seriously about readjustments to be made in the Bretton Woods institutions and in GATT  to make them better adapted to the conditions and needs of today's international economy? These conditions and needs are profoundly different from those  which  for three decades after the Second World War  made it possible to keep high rates of growth in world trade and economic output.37.	Brazil is one of the countries that has been most seriously affected by the current crisis  and this is  to a great extent  an ironic consequence of the fact that the development model adopted by the country was based on a vote of confidence in the international community's capacity to provide all countries with greater opportunities in international trade and on financial markets.38.	My country has made and will assuredly continue to make heavy sacrifices in order to adjust to the new and more difficult financial circumstances and to fulfill its commitments as a capital borrower. However  the Brazilian people cannot be denied the prospect of development  particularly when the major causes of its hardships are to be found  not in intrinsic limitations to the nation's productive structure  but rather in an unusual combination of external factors related to the economic policies and negotiating positions of some of the great Powers.39.	In these circumstances  the problems that afflict us are not exclusively ours but also concern those countries that have benefited so much from exports of capital  at costs which they are able unilaterally to define and alter. It makes no sense that such countries  often acting against their own interests in the repayment of their loans  deny their debtors  through the application of a most stringent protectionism  the export opportunities they need to pay their debts.40.	This was the reason why President Figueiredo said  when he addressed the Assembly last year  ""The solution of the present crisis lies not in aid for developing countries but in ensuring conditions that would enable them to meet their obligations through a fair return for their work"".41.	Before concluding my statement  I must refer to a specific problem of a critical nature that must not be seen from an emergency viewpoint only.42.	For five years my country has been suffering from the tragic effects of drought. The semi-arid north-east of Brazil is going through a particularly difficult period which defies the courage and severely tests the endurance of the local population and creates enormous obstacles to the implementation of plans for Brazilian regional development. The effects of this protracted drought are a national responsibility of Brazil's and are the object of integrated action on the part of the Government  but they cannot fail to have an impact on the nation's activities abroad.43.	Brazil has consistently supported the activities of the United Nations to combat desertification  especially with regard to the recovery and progress of the Sudan- Sahel region. We have also closely followed the debate on the measures designed to provide resources for the implementation of the Plan of Action to Combat Desertification approved in 1977/ We share the opinion that the question of climatic phenomena such as drought and desertification should be examined within the broader context )f international co-operation and from a long- term perspective.44.	If the present crisis is to have a renovating and purifying effect  the international system must be revitalized in an authentically democratic sense. At the international level  democracy corresponds to respect for national individualities and recognition of the sovereign equality of States. This means  in essence  that international coexistence should be based on the strict observance of the principles of self-determination and nonintervention and should pursue peaceful  rational and balanced solutions. 45.	The fact that the United Nations is now approaching its 40th anniversary is one more reason for us to learn a lesson of renewal from the contemporary crisis. It is essential that we preserve the spirit of those who took part in the construction and consolidation of the United Nations. A critical review of the past will be truly meaningful only if it is useful as a practical guide to present and future action.46.	The pace of history is accelerating  and the Organization cannot remain static. There is a wisdom inherent in the purposes and principles of the Charter of San Francisco. It is particularly urgent to apply these purposes and principles in keeping peace  preserving security and resuming development.As President Figueiredo said in the statement he made last year  the main point is that ""It is our common duty to fulfill the expectations of our predecessors  who  having themselves experienced the direct consequences of political disorder  economic depression and war  pledged their resolve  as well as ours  to promote peace and development."""
"21",992,"BRB",38,1983,"ï»¿216.	Sir  I wish to congratulate Mr. Ilueca on his election to the presidency of the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly. His long-standing association with the United Nations and his sterling contributions to its deliberations make him a fit person to guide our discussions. I hope that his tenure of office will see solutions to some of the problems that face the Organization.217.	I also want to pay a tribute to the outgoing President for the able way in which he conducted the affairs of the last session.218.	Barbados welcomes Saint Christopher and Nevis as the 158th Member of the Organization. Our long historical and cultural association makes Barbados confident that Saint Christopher and Nevis will contribute significantly to the work of the Organization.219.	This year  the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization returned to the theme of the apparent ineffectiveness of the United Nations in controlling conflict and working out solutions. He quite rightly alluded to the weakening of the commitment of Member States to co-operate within the framework of the United Nations in dealing with threats to international peace and security. There are too many local wars around the globe and too many are manifestations of East-West conflict. The Charter envisaged the abandonment of war as a solution to problems  yet since 1945 millions have died as a result of war. Despite the Charter's reaffirmation of faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person  much human suffering has resulted from failure to observe those rights. Nor has the world  in the years since 1945  succeeded in promoting the social progress and better standards of life to the extent contemplated in the Charter.220.	The Assembly  the Security Council and the other United Nations institutions have the power to influence international behaviour. We have the power collectively to legitimize those actions we favour and to frown upon those deeds of which we disapprove. But we have  in the words of the Secretary-General  ""to develop an effective common approach to potential threats to international peace and security"".221.	This would provide at least the moral sanction that would persuade contending States to accept the Organization's judgement.222.	Experience suggests that if consensus is not achieved than any proposed sanctions immediately become ineffective. Too often nations  particularly in the Security Council  oppose draft resolutions because they support the interests of another country or bloc of countries rather than because of their essential merits. This makes it all the more difficult for the Council to function effectively. To enhance respect for the United Nations  therefore  we must dedicate ourselves to honesty and truth. We must align our national interests with the interests of the international community. Our resolutions should condemn and deplore when they must. They must endorse and authorize when necessary. In situations that warrant it  it will be necessary for the United Nations to investigate and recommend. The Organization will succeed in this only if the motives of Member States are sincere rather than tendentious  for its effectiveness depends on cooperation rather than conflict among the Member States.223.	Barbados believes that the Security Council has to regain its rightful pre-eminence in dealing with threats to international peace  breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. But we also believe that Member States have an obligation to acknowledge that pre-eminence. As long as co-operation is lacking  the commitment to peace will be elusive.224.	For decades the Security Council has been grappling with at least two intractable problemsâthe Middle East and southern Africa  including Namibia. We believe that given the political will on all sides solutions to those problems can be found.225.	The Government of Barbados attaches great importance to the realization of a negotiated comprehensive peace in the Middle East consonant with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. In this attitude we are motivated by respect for the immutable principles of self-determination of peoples  fundamental human rights and the rule of law. We believe that the sine giver wow of peace in the Middle East is the resolution of the question of Palestine.226.	We are convinced Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  together with other recent initiatives  provide many basic elements which could be used for the negotiation of a permanent settlement of the Middle East problems. Those resolutions  which have the full support of Barbados  call for the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from occupied territories  termination of all claims and states of belligerency  acknowledgement of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of every State and of their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and  finally  the start of negotiations between the parties concerned.227.	Barbados recognizes the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people with the full right to participate in all deliberations on the question of Palestine.228.	Barbados recognizes and supports the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign and independent State within agreed and secure boundaries  but equally Barbados recognizes and supports the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to their own sovereign and independent State within agreed and secure boundaries. We are opposed to the use of force as a means of settling international disputes and believe that acts of aggression in the Middle East  far from enhancing the chances of a lasting peace  will only make that peace more difficult to attain.229.	The question of the territories occupied since 1967 is one of the central issues in a negotiated solution. The human settlements policy in violation of international law and runs counter to any lasting  peaceful solution to the Middle East conflict. United Nations resolutions have repeatedly called for the withdrawal of Israel from these territories. The United Nations has also rejected unilateral moves to change the status of Jerusalem. The annexation of territory by force is inadmissible in international law and is therefore unacceptable to Barbados.230.	We cannot close our eyes to the human suffering to which the Palestinian people are subjected as a result of measures in the occupied territories. Justice cannot be served by the suppression of basic human rights.231.	Barbados has followed with growing concern the recent developments in Lebanon. The people of Lebanon must be given the opportunity to solve their problems themselves. We are hopeful that the recently agreed ceasefire will hold and allow the opportunity for negotiation.232.	The southern Africa issuesâNamibia and apartheid continue to disturb the security of that continent and to bedevil international relations. Barbados continues to believe that the moral authority of a council that is seen to be impartial  that examines dispassionately and searches diligently for solutions to the questions brought before it would greatly enhance the legal obligation of States to implement its resolutions and decisions. We believe that the large majority of States supports the Security Council's proposals for the resolution of the problems associated with the actions of the Government of South Africa.233.	Yet South Africa has maintained its position of arrogant defiance and intransigence. It continues to challenge the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council calling for an end to the evil system of apartheid as well as for the independence of Namibia. Barbados is deeply concerned that the contact g up has not yet been able to find a viable solution to the Namibian problem. The contact group has not successfully defended the indictment that it has helped to prolong the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa.234.	In this connection Barbados very strongly supports the reservations  doubts and anxieties expressed by SWAPO  which has time and again called the attention of the world to the economic plundering of the resources of Namibia. It has cried out against the indignities inflicted on its people and indeed the daily physical danger in which its brothers and sisters are forced to live in their own country. All these horrifying conditions stem directly from the fact that South Africa is allowed to defy the decisions of the United Nations. The question of Namibia is nothing more or less than a question of decolonization. As such it is the direct legal  moral and particularly political responsibility of this Organization.235.	Barbados reiterates its endorsement of the Paris Declaration on Namibia and the Programme of Action adopted at the Conference at Paris in April.'"" We support the call for the immediate implementation of the United Nations plan approved in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The Security Council must take appropriate action to ensure compliance with its resolutions  and the ending of the destabilization of the front-line States.236.	Another manifestation of the phenomenon of forcible intervention in the affairs and territory of weaker States is the repeated attacks by South Africa on the front-line States. Since I last had the honour of addressing the Assembly  Mozambique  Angola and Lesotho have been flagrantly attacked by South Africa. This sort of intimidation must not be allowed to continue.237.	Barbados reaffirms its total condemnation and abhorrence of the system of apartheid	and deeply deplores the policies of systematic oppression of the black population. My Government pledges itself to continue to fight; in whatever forum it is represented  to find solutions within the terms and spirit of the Charter to bring to an end a system which is a scandalous affront to accepted principles of human dignity and self-respect.238.	The situation in Central America continues to cause serious concern. We believe that its origins are firmly based in the deep-rooted social and economic ills that for decades have confronted the area. Barbados supports the efforts of the Contadora Group and lauds its attempts to arrange consultations among all the protagonists. A lasting solution must involve the people of the region themselves. We feel that there must be a scaling down of the flow of arms and other interventions if a quick resolution of the issue is to be achieved. The conflict is affecting and will continue to affect co-operation in the hemisphere  especially since it diverts valuable resources from the more important tasks of social and economic reconstruction.239.	There are other issues that demand our attention. I refer to the Iran-Iraq conflict  Kampuchea  Cyprus  Korea  Afghanistan and  more recently  Chad. It is self- evident that these matters involve great difficulties. It is also self-evident that in every case there is more than one point of view  with each one being firmly held. Against this background Barbados holds two premises to be fundamental. First  it is a valid proposition that opposing points of view are genuinely held by the parties which espouse them to be in the best interests of their people. Secondly  it is the inescapable duty and function of this great Organization to strive unceasingly to achieve a reconciliation of opposing views. Failure to perform this function  this duty  will nurture a cynicism which will undermine the very foundations upon which the United Nations  this great hope of mankind  is built.240.	We hope that every effort will be made by the parties to these conflicts to explore every possible means of finding peaceful solutions. In this respect Barbados appeals to all concerned to co-operate fully in regional arrangements aimed at finding such solutions.241.	The international community faces another serious crisis in the area of disarmament and the arms race. As tensions develop  such as those surrounding the unfortunate shooting down of the South Korean civilian aircraft  the realization comes that a nuclear conflagration could very easily be started. Negotiations  whether bilateral or multilateral  must be encouraged in order to minimize this risk. Barbados calls on the super-Powers to act swiftly to conclude their negotiations on the reduction of strategic and intermediate-range nuclear weapons. Likewise  we would like to see a reduction in the expenditure on and proliferation of conventional weapons by all States.242.	The shooting down of an unarmed Korean civilian aircraft shocked the world. We are deeply concerned at the implications of this incident for the safety of international civil aviation. For what confidence can one have in international travel if acts like this are perpetrated? We trust that the world will never again witness such an occurrence.243.	A cause for satisfaction for Barbados is the confidence being placed in the United Nations by countries of the Non-Aligned Movement. Indeed  the presence at this session of the Chairman of the Movement  the Prime Minister of India  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  with several other heads of State and Government  is testimony to the continuing faith demonstrated by a large number of developing countries in the usefulness of this Organization. We are convinced that the Movement can play a significant role in the resolution of many of the problems which confront our world today. In this respect the work of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries can assist the efforts of the United Nations itself.244.	Barbados fully supports the Movement in its struggle against colonialism and in its opposition to the growing polarization in international relations which stems from military blocs  alliances and the cold war. We believe that the strengthening of the Non-Aligned Movement will assist in easing the tensions in international relations.245.	We have noted with approval that non-aligned countries have over the years given expression to the legitimate rights and aspirations of their peoples to shape their own destinies in accordance with their national aims and objectives. We have no hesitation in endorsing the reaffirmation made by heads of State and Government at New Delhi this year of the need for strict adherence to the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the affairs of other States. We assert that all States have the right to pursue their own economic development without intimidation  hindrance or pressure. Barbados joins with other non-aligned countries in their efforts to bring about a lessening of tensions and to strengthen international understanding.246.	Barbados  as a member of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries  is concerned at the unwillingness of certain developed countries to engage in serious and productive negotiations with a view to bringing about adequate solutions to world economic crises  crises which serve only to aggravate inequalities and injustices. We are convinced that only a restructuring of the international economic order will ensure lasting peace  security and prosperity for all the peoples of the world. We share the view that at this stage in international relations  decision making on matters of vital concern to all countries can no longer be the prerogative of any one group of countries  however powerful they may be. It is clear to us that in today's world a policy of co-operation must be pursued among States irrespective of their economic or social systems  size or location.247.	As we look at the world today the prospects are not comforting  yet we see around us an array of institutions supposedly devised to make the prospects good. We see hunger  disease and deprivation. We are helpless bystanders and feel our hands tied as we see brother killing brother and nation fighting nation. We see nations reeling under massive debt. We have an international monetary and financial system which has proved to be incapable of bringing economic activities into a state of balance. We see markets closed to willing entrants because of every type of protectionist barrier. In such circumstances there is small wonder that the confidence of many in the present system is dashed. Our task is to rebuild confidence by substituting another system that will work and live up to the rightful expectations of all peoples to economic progress and development.248.	The Barbados delegation is deeply concerned at the persistent crisis in the world economic situation. The continuing recession in the industrialized countries has put severe strains on export-oriented economies such as that of Barbados. It has put the integration movement in the Caribbean Community to a tough test for survival. This year's meetings of the Contracting Parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have proved disappointing in their failure to arrive at satisfactory solutions to the trade  industrial  developmental and financial problems of the developing countries. Official development assistance  including the funds placed at the disposal of UNDP for technical assistance  have not reached the levels established by agreement.249.	A number of international organizations have been addressing themselves to the seriousness of these economic problems. Quite recently the Organization of American States had a special meeting on the question of development financing. The secretariats of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Latin American Economic System also held a series of meetings in search of solutions to the debt problem. The Commonwealth Secretariat has produced a study by a commission under the chairmanship of Professor Helleiner of Canada. The debt issue also featured on the agenda of this year's IMF and World Bank meetings. Thus there is a full awareness of the persistence of debt repayment and trade problems. However  there is a lack of political will to deal with the problem in a manner that is satisfactory to debtors and creditors alike.250.	There is a crying need for change in the international monetary and financial system which obtains today. The tinkering which took place between 1971 and 1973 with respect to the Bretton Woods system has not addressed fundamental problems. There must be a restructuring of economic relationships so that developing countries have a greater say in recommending remedies.251.	Barbados joined this Organization seventeen years ago and has since carried out ail its obligations under the Charter. States like Barbados cannot rely on military might to assist their independence and sovereignty. They do not have that might. Such States must place their security in the unity of nations and attachment to principles. Barbados has a vested interest in maintaining a peaceful environment in the Caribbean region  in the hemisphere  in the world. Whatever economic or social progress countries such as ours have made over the years can very easily be destroyed. For us  therefore  peace and security are no less important than economic progress and social development. The United Nations provides the possibility for continuing commitment to these principles. Barbados will play its part in ensuring that such commitment is not allowed to weaken. For the first time  therefore  Barbados is offering its candidature for a seat on the Security Council. This candidature is a further demonstration of our faith in the United Nations. We are convinced that our nation has a contribution to make to the counsels of that body. We pledge our service in the efforts to enhance the effectiveness of this important institution.252.	Finally  it is pertinent to ask and to reflect on why we are here. Why have so many world leaders traversed so many thousands of miles to attend this session of the General Assembly? Is it not because they have an abiding faith in mankind?253.	In the inspiration of the moment  a famous poet exclaimed  ""What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculties!"" Yet with all this vast potential the human race is still groping for self- fulfilment. Stunted by illiteracy  drained by hunger  warped by racism and bigotry  tom and bleeding through war  benumbed by drugs and fantasy  mankind looks longingly for lasting peace and security.254.	What we have achieved to date has been the collective contribution of us all. History mocks that nation or culture which claims that it alone is responsible for present progress. We have all paid our dues. History also mocks those nations which worship technological power. It was technology  made sinister by science perverted  thatcaused the world wars of this century to be so pervasive and so devastating.255.	Out of this wreckage and misery came the United Nations. We came together as States to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person  in equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.256.	Today the United Nations stands as a symbol of the aspirations of the human race. Together let us preserve it. Let us develop it to meet our future needs. Through it let us seek to realize the vast  untapped potential of human beings everywhere  particularly that of the innocent children of all races  cultures and creeds who will inherit the earth. Let this new collective achievement be the dearest legacy of this century to the next. "
"22",1068,"BTN",38,1983,"ï»¿73.	 Mr. President  I should like to begin by heartily congratulating you on your well- deserved election to the high office of the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. You have had a close association with the United Nations  and your diplomatic abilities and knowledge of international affairs are well known. My delegation is therefore happy to see such a capable and renowned personality of Panama  a developing and non-aligned country  preside over the work of this important session. Bhutan  as one of the Vice-Presidents  will extend all necessary co-operation and assistance to you in the difficult task that lies ahead.74.	May I also take this opportunity to commend your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the efficient manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session. We wish him the very best in all his future endeavours.75.	Before I proceed further  I should like to extend our warm welcome to Saint Christopher and Nevis  the 158th Member State of the Organization. We are confident that the contribution of that newly independent nation will be highly valuable to the Organization.76.	This thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly has begun on a somewhat different note from the ones we have witnessed in recent years  especially in view of the current international situation and the gathering of several heads of State or Government. It was an underlying sense of insecurity and the accompanying feeling of helplessness as regards the fate of our world that prompted the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to propose the gathering of heads of State or Government during this session. It is our understanding that their informal meetings  presided over by Mrs. Indira Gandhi  Prime Minister of India and the Chairperson of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  were very useful. Those meetings have no doubt heightened the awareness of the very grave dangers inherent in the current world situation. This  in turn  should generate the impetus  at the highest political levels  for the search for solutions to the difficult issues before us.77.	Recently we were perturbed by the increased tensions between the two super-Powers. We deeply regret the downing of the Korean airliner  which was very unfortunate. That incident undoubtedly requires a thorough investigation. At this juncture  I should like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of those who perished on the flight. The international community must now take steps  with the co-operation of all concerned  to institute measures which will ensure that such incidents do not occur in future. At the same time  we urge the two super-Powers not to be detected in their efforts to reduce their nuclear arsenals and towards improving the overall international atmosphere.78.	The ever-present danger of a nuclear war precipitated by madness  or by accident  or by misreading the flashes on a radar screen  hangs over all of us. Hence  in the context of general and complete disarmament  efforts to bring about nuclear disarmament must be pursued vigorously.79.	The peace-keeping mechanism of the United Nationsâthe Security Councilâhas faced considerable difficulties in the maintenance of international peace and security. The responsibility for strengthening the Security Council lies with all of us  and particularly the Council's permanent members. Here again  I should like to single out the two super-Powers amongst them. My delegation would like to urge those countries to take steps to make the role of the Security Council more effective. In the event of armed conflicts art sing in any part of the world  the Council must be able to bring about immediate ceasefire and initiate peaceful dialogue.80.	The Security Council must also be able to ensure the implementation of its own resolutions. It cannot remain the victim of super-Power rivalry  a rivalry that has adversely affected and permeated every facet of international relations.81.	The role of the Secretary-General in preventive diplomacy  and particularly the process of avoiding armed flare-ups in international disputes  should be given high priority. At this stage  my delegation would like to commend the Secretary-General for his many open and behind-the-scenes efforts to find peaceful solutions to international problems. His report on the work of the Organization submitted to the previous session of the General Assembly has been widely hailed in respect of the role of the United Nations and especially its capacity to maintain the peace. The Secretary-General has submitted another report to this session	which adds to and supplements the earlier one. We should now like to see positive and concrete action initiated towards implementing the report.82.	Several speakers before me have stressed the less advertised but highly critical role that the United Nations and its specialized agencies are playing. The international community has benefited immensely from the work ofUNDP  UNICBF  WHO  FAO  ICAO and so forth. The relevance of the United Nations  despite the recent criticisms that it has faced  is greater today than ever before. The vast majority definitely support the United Nations. One can no longer imagine the state of world affairs and the conduct of international relations in the absence of this Organization. It is the only body where all countries are represented on an equal footing.83.	My delegation had hoped that the stalemate on the question of Namibia would have been broken by now. We expected to see the representatives of that international Territory sitting amongst the sovereign nations of the world. However  that has not happened. The occupation of Namibia by South Africa continues. The reason given is the presence of Cuban troops in Angola. We consider the linking of the Cuban troops to Namibia's independence not only as absurd but also as baseless and unacceptable.84.	Within South Africa itself  the policy of persists. The appeals of humanity to end such a policy have fallen on deaf ears. However  South Africa can be assured that Namibia's independence and the abolition of apartheid shall remain the sacred objectives of the international community at large. We must continue to strike the wall of stubbiness until it finally gives way.85.	In the Middle East the inalienable rights of the Palestinians continue to be denied. The war between Iran and Iraq rages on. The only silver lining in the dark clouds hovering over the Middle East was the recent cease-fire in Lebanon. Nevertheless  continued international interference and intervention in Lebanon's affairs by external forces gives us much cause for alarm. Peace can be accomplished in the Middle East only when the rights of the Palestinians are fully recognized  the Iran-Iraq war is brought to a halt  all foreign forces are withdrawn from Lebanon and the rights of all States to exist within internationally recognized boundaries are accepted.86.	Bhutan has always opposed foreign interference and intervention in the affairs of sovereign States. Therefore  on grounds of principle we cannot accept the presence of foreign troops in any country without the express approval and consent of the legitimate Government. This particularly applies to South-East and South-West Asia. Whenever there is a problem regarding a recognized authority  then in such a case withdrawal of foreign forces should be followed by an interim United Nations administration to supervise the constitution of a legitimate government.87.	Allow me now to turn to some of the economic issues before us. Without a doubt the primary responsibility for the development of a nation rests with the nation itself. Developing countries  therefore  have to pursue well-evaluated policies which would effectively contribute to the improvement of the socio-economic conditions of their people. In Bhutan we are pursuing such a course to the best of our ability. It is also our understanding that many other developing countries are doing the same. However  once development policies and goals are set  the external environment largely determines the success or failure of a country's socio-economic objectives. It is in this area that the developing countries have been fervently calling for changes and the establishment of a new international economic order.88.	The changes that the developing countries have been seeking are well known. The international community has the obligation and the responsibility to consider undertaking both short-term and long-term measures to sustain the recovery in the developed countries as well as to promote an adequate pace of development in the developing ones. While deciding on the various courses of action  all interests and views should be considered. The rules of fair play should dictate our moves. Decisions should  therefore  be taken in a forum where all nations  big or small  powerful or weak  are represented on an equal footing.89.	The deadlock in the North-South dialogue and the tendencies to undermine multilateral economic co-operation are of great concern to my delegation. The international community must get around to the convening of the long-delayed global negotiations. The call for an international conference on money and finance for development must also be urgently heeded. These are not simply empty slogans but critical needs of the hour. Growing interdependence among various groups of countries calls for the establishment of a system that is just and equitable  otherwise the developing countries will continue to languish in poverty and deprivation. Such a state of affairs  as many speakers before me have emphasized  will have adverse consequences for the developed economies as well.90.	The least developed countries are economically the most weak and vulnerable group. The world economic crisis has severely affected their growth performance. In 1980 their gross domestic product per capita increased only slightly  while in 1981 it actually declined. The very low growth in those countries has been persistent for too long a time. The average income per annum per head reached only $226 in 1980 for the least developed countries  compared to $982 for all developing countries. This poor growth performance is also reflected in the very low rate of investment in those countries.91.	The international community has not been entirely averse to the least developed countries. In fact the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries held in Paris in 1981 took a major step by adopting the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries. UNDP  UNCTAD and the World Bank Live assisted the least developed countries to make contacts with donors. The reactions of many donors were encouraging  but I regret to say that their efforts and contributions thus far have not been significant in many cases. Their contributions must be substantially increased in order to fulfil the socio-economic objectives of the Substantial New Programme of Action. It is our hope that  in spite of the delay in implementing that programme  the concerned international organizations and donors will take all the required follow-up steps to ensure that the objectives of the Par:5 Conference are met.92.	A constant  adequate and assured flow of resources is essential to these poorest countries if they are to be able to create the means for achieving sustained development. Within the framework of the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product to be provided as official development assistance to the developing countries  the Substantial New Programme of Action has stipulated that 0.15 per cent of gross national product goes to the least developed countries. The efforts of some developed countries have been commendable  as they have not only reached these targets but have even surpassed them. We hope that other countries will make every effort to increase such resource transfers.93.	Recently there has been much concern expressed at the deterioration of the resource position of some multilateral development organizations  UNDP in particular. UNDP  UNICEF  UNFPA and other such organizations have become important factors in the socio-economic development of several developing countries. The resource positions of these institutions must be adequately increased in order to support development activities  otherwise their achievements and the significant benefits that the poorest countries derive from their programmes may deteriorate or even collapse.94.	As crucial and irreplaceable as North-South cooperation is  South-South co-operation is also vital. My delegation has observed the gradual progress being made in several spheres among the developing countries. In our own region of South Asia  seven countries  namely  Bangladesh  India  Maldives  Nepal  Pakistan  Sri Lanka and my own  have taken a historic step towards regional co-operation. There are many obstacles  both colonial and current  that are yet to be overcome. However  Bhutan is happy to see that all the countries I have just mentioned are making a genuine effort to attain success in this long-overdue venture.95.	Just recently  on 1 and 2 August this year  our Foreign Ministers met jointly for the first time at New Delhi and took a major step forward by issuing over their signatures the declaration of South Asian regional cooperation. They outlined the basic objectives  principles and institutional and financial arrangements for co-operation in economic  social  cultural  technical and scientific fields. The declaration further provides that such cooperation would be based on respect for the principles of sovereign equality  territorial integrity  political independence  non-interference in internal affairs of other States and mutual benefit. The meeting of the heads of State or Government of the seven countries of South Asia is expected to be finalized at the next meeting of the Foreign Ministers.96.	These positive developments augur well for the progress of our region and give us much hope for the future.97.	Some of the issues before us may seem difficult and some even insurmountable. They will continue to remain so if rigid positions are maintained. Solutions to problems may require some compromise in order to accommodate  to an acceptable degree  the interests of all parties concerned. Given such an attitude  combined with the required political will and with the greater good of humanity in mind  we can yet hope to make our world a happier planet. "
"23",1108,"BWA",38,1983,"ï»¿230.	The Secretary-General has once again awakened the international community to what he correctly characterizes as  the partial paralysis of the United Nations as the guardian of  international peace and security . Indeed  the world Organization has been restricted in its efforts to defuse wars in Africa  Asia and the Americas.231.	The agenda before us tells a familiar story  the story of the institutional limitations of the United Nations  for it is replete with perennial political issues defying quick resolution. Yet once again these issues will be thoroughly debated. Many resolutions will be adopted  some  as the Secretary-General ruefully observes   requesting reports which form the basis for new resolutions   others to be filed away  to be remembered and quoted at the next session. Whilst recurring resolutions  unimplemented and unimplementable  may provide sufficient justification for our annual pilgrimage to New York and for keeping the Secretariat in business  repeated failure to and solutions to international problems has only exacerbated our sense of insecurity and fear  hopelessness and desperation. We congratulate the Secretary-General for raising high the Charter of the United Nations as a beacon to guide our international relations  and for seeking from all Governments a recommitment to its purposes and principles. My country will not be found wanting in this regard. We thank the Secretary-General also for the practical interest he has displayed in his search for peace and security in our world.232.	Coming as I do from southern Africa  a region that has suffered and continues to bleed for the liberation and freedom of its oppressed people  I delight in the knowledge that the Secretary-General's visit to the region has  in his own words  brought home to him vividly the human tragedy of the situation and the urgency required to resolve it. In his words   we have never before been so close to finality on the modalities of implementing [Security Council] resolution 435 (1978) .s He reached this conclusion after SWAPO  often maligned as dissident and recalcitrant  had declared its support for the recommendations on the composition of UNTAG and pledged its readiness to accept without conditions either of the two electoral systems set out in the Western constitutional proposals. By contrastâand characteristic of South Africa's consistently obstructionist attitude throughout the history of Namibia's struggle for independenceâno definitive reply concerning the accepted electoral system has been received from South Africa. The South African Administrator-General in Namibia will hold his cards close to his chest until after the date for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has been agreed on.233.	As if this dissonance were not blight enough on the hopes for the long-delayed implementation of resolution 435 (1978)  the South African authorities are continuing to insist on the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola as a precondition for the peaceful solution of the Namibian problem. The international community has unequivocally pronounced its opposition to the introduction of the concept of linkage. Even the facade of unity displayed by the contact group in defence of that linkage has cracked under the heat of the political opprobrium it has generated. The linkage of the independence of Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola has been declared illogical and irrelevant to the issue of Namibian independence by virtually all parties concerned. Its originators  the United States of America and South Africa  should therefore be persuaded to abandon it and thus to allow the resumption of the process leading to the political independence of Namibia.234.	On the economic front  the Thirion report  preparedly a South-African-appointed commission  reveals that Namibia has suffered serious decline in the past few years and is in economic danger as the result of existing policies. The country's outstanding debt is equal to 130 per cent of its national income and is likely to rise even more. Although some of this can be blamed on the recession that has afflicted the world economy and some on the devastating drought engulfing southern Africa  more blame should fall on the South African apartheid constitution  which divides government in Namibia into three tiers  the second of which consists of 11 authorities set up to administer the affairs of the different ethnic groups. The report notes that the system has led to a remarkable multiplicity of Government departments for one of the most sparsely populated countries. There are 11 departments of education  11 of health  11 of pensions  and so on  for a population of just over 1 millionâso that Namibians cynically refer to the system as  one man  one Government .235.	The longer the delay in the granting of independence to Namibia  the greater will be the ruin of the Territory's human and material resources.236.	We pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the faithful observance of the terms of his mandate and his rejection of the contrived linkage. We urge him to continue to seek South Africa's co-operation in order to expedite the implementation of resolution 435 (1978). We urge the members of the contact group to help the United States and South Africa to extricate themselves from the impedimental and obstructionist position in which they have become embroiled.237.	On 2 November the people of South Africaâor die volk  as they are commonly known in their nativeAfrikaansâgo to the polls to decide on a new constitution. The Constitution Bill  which has been the subject of discussion at political rallies  horse races and braaivleis parties for the better part of two years  was approved by the white minority Parliament in mid-September. The constitution provides for a tricameral parliament by giving Coloureds and Indians  some 5 million persons  a limited role in the white Government of the country  whilst it excludes the African majority in the so-called dispensation. One of the objectives of the proposed arrangement is to break the ever-growing solidarity of the oppressed black peoples in their struggle for the restoration of their human rights and dignity in their own country.238.	The measure is seen and opposed by the Conservative Party of South Africa as an erosion of whiteand domination; it is opposed by the Progressive Federal Party on the grounds that it continues to exclude black South Africans from power-sharing; and it is opposed by the black South Africans themselves because it denies them their basic rights and their role as citizens. The new arrangements will thus fan ethnic animosities  exacerbate tribal divisions and set back the peaceful evolution of concerted non-white opposition to racism.239.	In the meantime  opposition to apartheid in South Africa continues to manifest itself in various acts of sabotage and bomb attacks against offices  court buildings  police stations and bridges. Recent events  such as the Pretoria bomb attack and pronouncements by the leadership of the liberation movements  indicate a progressively deteriorating situation. Theologians of different races openly risk their liberty and security by proclaiming Christian witness of the oneness of humanityâand here I refer to personalities such as Bishop Tutu  Dr. Boesak and Dr. Naude.240.	Official reaction to these acts of sabotage has been the mobilization of the State apparatus for the confiscation of travel documents  house arrests  detentions which have often resulted in mysterious deaths in custody  and death sentences in defiance of international pleas for clemency. Neighbouring States Lave been accused of harbouring freedom fighters  providing sanctuary for what are referred to as criminal fugitives and permitting in their countries the establishment of bases from which attacks are mounted against South Africa.241.	Assurances by neighbouring States that their territories will not be and are not being used for launching incursions into South Africa have been given. Notwithstanding such assurances  South Africa has chosen aggression as one of its foreign policy strategies in its relations with neighbouring States. We witness today various acts of aggression against the Kingdom of Lesotho  whether by direct commando raids or by way of aiding and abetting the activities of the insurgent Lesotho Liberation Army  the harassment of Lesotho nationals at border crossings  the impounding of goods consigned to Lesotho. Those are acts of economic and political sabotage. Lesotho is not alone in this  for the repeated military raids into Mozambique and Angola and  what is more  the permanent occupation of southern Angola by the South African Army  support by South Africa for dissidents in those countries and in Zimbabwe  the sabotaging of costly infrastructure  fuel tanks  aeroplanes  railways and locomotives  the curtailment of trade agreements  and so on  all confirm the fact of South Africa's policy of economic and political destabilization in the region. We look to the United Nations and particularly to the Western Powers to express the same indignation and the same moral outrage about the situation in southern Africa as they do about the situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea.242.	The problems of the Republic of Chad in central Africa are not new. Chad has been the scene of political turmoil and civil strife spanning two decades. Solutions and resolutions to halt the conflict have had only a temporary effect  and interim arrangements pending the election of a Government have not held for very long. Towns have been razed and whatever infrastructure there might have been largely destroyed. N'Djamena  the capital  bears bullet scars as evidence of the battles that have raged there in the past and is a sad reminder of what may yet happen again  for it is clear that  with outside Powers ranged behind one or another of the different Chad parties  military victories will continue to be transient phenomena and peace will remain an elusive objective.243.	Incentives should be offered to the various political groups to create a viable peace  not to carry on an unwinnable war. To assist Chad  the international community should call for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign forces and should stop the shipment of arms to the warring parties. Simultaneously  the political groups in Chad should be given moral  political  and economic encouragement to negotiate a settlement and a Government that can develop the country in the interests of all.244.	The question of Western Sahara continues to occupy a sensitive place in the politics of Africa. In his message to the General Assembly  the current Chairman of the OAU  the head of State of Socialist Ethiopia  gave an account of his efforts in search of a solution to a problem which threatens the unity of the continental organization. Botswana supports those efforts without reservation and urges the parties concerned to implement without further delay the decision of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  taken at its eighteenth session  at Nairobi in 1981  to allow the people of Western Sahara to settle the conflict through a referendum. 245.	The situation in the Middle East continues to exercise our minds. An end to the homelessness  pain and suffering of the Palestinian people remains a pious objective. Israel has not complied with any General Assembly or Security Council resolution calling for its withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem. Yet  the same Israel often speaks of peace and security while its policies and practices in the occupied territories  particularly the establishment of settlements  are directly contributing to the absence of peace in the region. The General Assembly should continue to maintain undiluted the guidelines for the international effort to resolve the problem.246.	The Iran-Iraq conflict has been going on for about three years now. Whatever they were  the reasons that prompted the war in the first instance seem now to have lost their relevance and validity  and to those far away from the scene the continued fighting appears to be the result of the force of habit acquired over the past three years and disagreement about the terms of the cease-fire and the level of reparations to be paid.247.	The war  which has already taken a heavy toll of human lives and material resources  is likely to escalate with the rumoured recent acquisition of new sophisticated weaponry by Iraq  precipitating the threat of retaliatory action by Iran. Such action would adversely affect the national interests of other States and should therefore be avoided.248.	The international community should urge the two countries to end this destructive war  engage in negotiations leading to the peaceful settlement of their differences and accept mediation by disinterested parties.249.	Afghanistan and Kampuchea continue to suffer occupation by foreign forces. We urge their withdrawal so that the peoples of these two countries may exercise their right to self-determination. We continue to support the reconvening of the International Conference on Kampuchea.250.	My country  like many others  has conveyed to the President  the Government and the people of the Republic of Korea Ks condolences on the double tragedy of the shooting down of the Korean commercial airliner and the more recent bomb attack in Rangoon  which again resulted in loss of life  including that of four cabinet ministers. It is all the more tragic in that in both cases the killing was intentional  not accidental  and was carried out against unsuspecting civilians in peace-time.251.	The grievous experience of the Republic of Korea is a sad commentary on the ideological polarization of the people of Korea and the divided state of their country. Korean leaders from both the North and the South share the dream of a united fatherland. Their national political postures on the modalities of realizing that dream are poles apart and seemingly irreconcilable. The basic problem is that the Koreans at e caught up in the ideological rivalry of the super-Powers. The procedural problems encountered in the current Geneva talks resemble those experienced in the Korean North-South dialogue. Proposals by one side are spurned by the other without dialogue or negotiation. The consistent position of my country is that the solution of the Korean question is the direct concern of the Koreans themselves. We believe that for meaningful discussions to be held  preconditions likely to wreck the convening of the meeting must be avoided and proposals submitted by either side must be examined and discussed before they can be discarded.252.	Korean leaders share the dream of a united fatherland. It should not be the United Nations itself or any of its Member States that should be seen to discourage the attainment of that objective by any means.253.	Also of concern to us is the increasing number of centers of conflict in Central America. We join the people of the region in their call for an end to the bloody conflicts bedevilling El Salvador  Guatemala and Nicaragua and for peaceful solutions to their problems. Here again external interference in their internal affairs for the sake of spreading or protecting spheres of influence can only serve to escalate their conflict and deny the people of those countries their right not only to self-determination but also to economic and political autonomy.254.	The year 1983 seems to mark a turning-point in the world economy with the first signs of an economic recovery from the long-drawn-out recession  particularly in the United States. However  we must ask whether this upturn will be strong enough to pull the developing countries out of their deep economic slump.255.	Many of the developing countriesâparticularly those whose well-being is predominantly dependent on their export earnings from primary commoditiesâhave suffered seriously from the prolonged world recession. The precipitous decline in their primary export earnings has resulted in a sharp reduction in their capacity to import and has compounded the growing difficulties in their external debt repayments  as well as their access to additional international financial flows. In such circumstances  many of our countries have been compelled to take very painful adjustment measures  and in most cases the costs of such measures have been very heavy indeed.256.	The magnitude of the external debt burden of developing countries has reached alarming proportions. The total medium-term and long-term external debt  excluding that of the oil-producing developing countries  has quadrupled in the last 10 years  rising from $125 billion in 1973 to nearly $500 billion in 1983.257.	The presence of such a mammoth debt burden underlines the close and often fragile interdependence of all nations. It poses a serious threat to the lifeline of the developing nations. Moreover  the proportion of official development assistance in the net inflow of foreign capital to developing countries has been substantially curtailed in recent years  while the share of private commercial finance has risen sharply. This trend  combined with the extraordinarily high interest rates  has exacerbated the debt-service problems of the developing countries. I believe that we must address ourselves to this debt crisis with more than the short-term wisdom shown so far.258.	The implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries  adopted at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  must be speeded up  giving top priority to the question of debt relief to developing countries.259.	I strongly urge concerted international action and co-operation on this grave issue. In this regard the role of multilateral institutions such as IMF and the World Bank is critical. These institutions should consider additional alternative proposals in reviewing the conditions that usually accompany credit packages to developing countries. Very often the deflationary conditionality conventionally imposed by these institutions have forced the developing countries to curtail productive programmes  while failing to engender greater use of their human resources to become self-sustaining.260.	I also appeal to the world community at large to augment the How of official development assistance to those low-income developing countries which have no access to world financial markets.261.	I am convinced that  without this concerted action at the international level  no degree of recovery in the Western world will end the deepening economic crisis in the developing countries.262.	It is now nearly seven years since the Integrated Programme for Commodities was adopted under the auspices of UNCTAD. It is disappointing to note the slow progress made on this important programme  in spite of innumerable meetings and conferences. The Integrated Programme should be put into effect rapidly  now that the Common Fund has been established.263.	The need for such action is all the more pressing in light of the virtual collapse of the export earnings of many primary producing developing countries. We should also consider implementing an emergency programme to supplement the existing export earnings stabilization schemes available through IMF system.264.	All our efforts towards greater trade  with commodity price stabilization  will be futile if the growing protectionist attitude of industrialized nations towards imports from developing countries continues. Unless the various tariff and non-tariff barriers are reduced  the prospects for the sustained development of most developing countries will remain highly unsatisfactory. In the process of developing more rapidly  these countries import each year capital goods  intermediate goods and even consumer goods from the industrialized countries  but these imports will be sustainable only if the developing countries can earn more foreign exchange than they can earn by exporting primary products alone. The expansion of world trade along lines of comparative advantage  which is essential to the continued development of both groups of nations  requires that developing countries be allowed to export manufactured products to the industrialized countries whenever they can produce such goods at lower real costs. If this is not allowed  neither aid nor lending to developing countries will be sufficient to achieve satisfactory growth  and both groups of nations will be worse off than they need be.265.	We must all learn our lessons from the prolonged global recession and its aftermath. We must develop international economic relations on a new basis to prevent the world economy from repeating its past and to enable all its participants to create a different future."
"24",1152,"CAF",38,1983,"ï»¿I should like at the outset to expressthe hope of the Central African Republic  its Government and its President  General Andr6 Kolingba  that the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly will make a valuable contribution to strengthening our Organization and enhancing its effectiveness in defending the ideals of peace  security and progress.225.	It is also an honour for me to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the thirty- eighth session.226.	I should also like to take this opportunity to hail the considerable efforts made by his predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  during his term of office.227.	I wish in particular to re-emphasize our country's support for the Secretary-General.228.	The qualities that distinguish each of these persons and their total devotion to the cause of the Organization are all the more reassuring in that they have been displayed in a very troubled and disturbed world.229.	Finally  my delegation congratulates Saint Christopher and Nevis on its accession to independence and warmly welcomes its admission to the United Nations.230.	In order to create certain conditions likely to make for a happier century  the United Nations has from the very outset drawn up a series of important covenants on human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the thirty-fifth anniversary of which we are celebrating this year  is without any doubt the most prestigious of instruments in view of its impact on the political and constitutional life of States. The covenants  conventions and other instruments which subsequently completed this Declaration by emphasizing civil and political rights and economic  cultural and social rights  have provided the international community with a legal framework which is well adapted to mould a world where noble aspirations are met so that the agony of hope can continue.231.	The energies to be channelled should be aimed at promoting and enshrining human rights so that human beings can  individually and collectively  in freedom and dignity  flourish physically  mentally  socially and economically  without any discrimination.232.	Nevertheless  numerous attacks have eroded and endangered these rights both within our States and between them. Accession to these covenants has not yet given rise on a world-wide scale to any encouraging progress for the freedom  dignity and security of human beingsâthat is  progress in their formulation and their interpretation and the specific meaning to give to them.233.	Freedom and the dignity of the human being is not simply a question of paying lip-service to the sacred and unquestionable values which are inherent in them.234.	They also mean as a necessary corollary that each of our States must be in charge of its main material means  cultural resources and economic heritage. Indeed  what are freedom and dignity in poverty and deprivation? The erosion of freedom and dignity is the consequence of these evils which have been engendered and maintained by the inequities of the present political  social and economic order which is the very quintessence of indifference  contempt  intolerance and violence.235.	That is why the Central African Republic  whose principles and ideals of non-alignment remain at the heart of its foreign policy  considers that the state of the world can improve only if within each State everyone cherishes the love for his neighbour and at the same time cultivates generosity and solidarity aimed at promoting freedom  security and development.236.	The Central African Republic for its part has embodied in its internal legislation the main provisions contained in the international covenants guaranteeing essential human rights. It has maintained contact with the various international bodies whose task it is to ensure their implementation.237.	Thus  despite the burdensome heritage of the storm-tossed history of the past 14 years  the Military Committee of National Reconstruction has proceeded to focus its efforts on realizing all the progress required to give new hope to the people of the Central African Republic and fan the flames of a faith that will make it possible for them better to appreciate the dimensions and the terrors of the nightmare they have gone through.238.	There must also be generosity and solidarity between States in order to promote freedom and dignity throughout the world.239.	If States made a requirement of that ideal  there can be no doubt that the present circumstances surrounding international relations would be considerably modified in favour of respect for the sovereignty of States and the aspirations of the peoples still struggling for their political emancipation.240.	The current session is being held at a time when some negotiations are being broken off or are deadlocked  thus reinforcing the frequently expressed feeling that our Organization is powerless to settle conflicts and supporting the belief that international relations are based on cynicism. The Central African Republic is convinced  however  that the Organization remains the most effective framework for the settlement of these matters  involving as they do universal principles and ideals. The Organization  as it has shown in certain circumstances  is quite equal to the task of providing solutions to the problems which face the international community  as long as each of its Members accepts and acts and behaves in accordance with the vocation of the Organization.241.	In this connection  the situations which persist in certain parts of the world  particularly Africa  the Middle East  Asia and America  should continue to be given special attention by the international community.242.	It is intolerable that Namibia continues to be deprived of its right to freedom and self-determination simply because of the will of one over-confident State that continues to defy the Organization. The Central African Republic is one of the countries which  at the end of the International Conference in Support of the Struggle of the Namibian People for Independence held last April in Paris  felt that the decisions adopted at that time should not remain a dead letter.243.	The Member States of the Organization should contribute actively to the implementation of those resolutions so that Namibia could no longer serve as a pretext for South African acts of aggression against other States of the region  but should accede immediately to independence  without any pre-conditions  under the leadership of SWAPO  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.244.	We cannot but denounce the obstinacy displayed by the South African authorities in their attempts to perpetuate the odious system of	and in their recourse to summary and barbaric executions  the most recent of which shocked the entire world. Let us hope that these crimes will strengthen the ardent faith of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa who struggle for their freedom and their flouted dignity.245.	It is that same demand for freedom and dignity that will make it possible for the peoples of Western Sahara to choose their own future and lead to the reconciliation of the States in that part of Africa  which will undoubtedly help to bring peace to that region which is so vital to the destiny of the African continent. This is inherent in the bold initiatives adopted last June at the nineteenth session of the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity246.	Closer to the Central African Republic  the great people of Chad have for more than a decade been experiencing a tragedy whose serious effects threaten the stability of the central African region. Chad has been experiencing untold suffering  brought about and maintained by intolerable interference in its internal affairs. We appeal for the immediate cessation of that interference and of the hostilities. The Central African Republic  faithful to the major principles underlying international relations  supports the legitimate Government of Chad in its efforts to defend its territorial integrity  and condemns the act of aggression which is undermining the authority of the State and the national unity.247.	Consequently  my country associates itself with any action that circumstances may dictate to thwart the shameful efforts to undermine the legitimacy of the Government of Chad and Chad's sovereignty.248.	This is the context in which to assess the generous assistance given to the people of Chad at their express request by their friends. The Central African Republic welcomes this attitude  which will create the conditions necessary for national reconciliation in Chad and peace in the subregion. 249.	Deprived of its right to freedom and dignity  the Palestinian people seem to be doomed to wandering. We ail deplore this  but we have been powerless to do anything about this for the past 30 years. These people  united behind the PLO  have been dispersed and shaken by a serious crisis of identity caused by their enemies. They have been used as an excuse to tear Lebanon apart and intimidate other States in the region. Their frustration and bitterness will not be contained indefinitely if the international community does not at last ensure the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions recognizing their right as well as that of Israel to a free  sovereign and guaranteed existence.250.	The situation is little better in the rest of the world.251.	States must agree on concerted action to ensure that United Nations resolutions on the question of Democratic Kampuchea are implemented. It is unacceptable nowadays for certain States to occupy the territory of others  without regard for their freedom  dignity and sovereignty. The usurped national rights of Kampuchea and Afghanistan must be restored.252.	The Korean peninsula has become an increasingly serious subject of concern in view of the threats there to peace. The Central African Republic believes that it is urgently necessary to make this nerve centre a zone of peace. Only then will the two parties concerned be able to make effective use of the South-North Joint CommuniquÃ© of 4 July 1972 9 which is a valid basis for a free dialogue which could lead to the peaceful reunification of the Korean people  without any foreign interference.253.	The situation in Central America is no less disturbing. The Central African Republic appeals to the parties to show the political will to reduce tension through negotiations and bring peace back to that part of the world.254.	If it is true that States must cultivate solidarity and generosity to promote freedom and dignity  it is equally true that these same ideals must be the means of combating those factors which encourage insecurity and a holocaust.255.	Action against civilian aircraft which makes victims of the innocent is unjustifiable in our eyes and contrary to the rules of international civil aviation. These ignoble acts clearly demonstrate the underlying desire to create tension and division and perpetrate crimes against peoples which aspire to unity and peace. They remind us how fragile is peace and how necessary it is to combat the factors that underlie the conflicts.256.	The proliferation of sophisticated weapons of mass destruction is not likely to bring about a propitious climate for the cause of freedom and dignity in the world.257.	The Central African Republic  while deploring the deadlock in the negotiations on disarmament  expresses the hope that members of the international community will engage in concerted and sustained action to reduce and curb the arms race and make possible general  complete and verified disarmament and the transfer of the efforts and resources thus released to the process of development. There would then emerge a kind of solidarity and generosity regarding development which would protect mankind from the scourges from which it suffers at present.258.	Such solidarity and generosity concerning development are essential  for that alone can make the end of our century a happier time in which to live  or at least a less gloomy and austere time. This is the kind of solidarity and generosity that is defined in the philosophy that guides our head of State and President of the Military Committee of National Recovery  General AndreKolingba  in his ceaseless action over the past two years to bring about the reconstruction and development of the Central African Republic.259.	In view of the heavy burden on his shoulders  the Central African head of State  putting particular emphasis on the national effort  proposed to the Central African people a contract of solidarity  entailing huge sacrifices  for the development of the key sectors of the national economy. Priority has of course been given to agriculture in order to achieve self-sufficiency in food.260.	From my delegation's point of view  this kind of solidarity and generosity at the national level can be transferred to the international level if we truly wish to tackle the economic crisis which spares no country today. In an impulse of solidarity  States must help one another contain the effects of this crisis  namely inflation  increased interest rates with consequences for the burden of debt  restriction or even refusal of access to markets and to capital  an unprecedented fall in raw materials prices  the drying-up of multilateral sources of financeâall further aggravated by difficult access to technology and the inadaptability of the present international monetary and financial system.261.	Two thirds of mankind  mainly the least developed countries and above all the land-locked countries like the Central African Republic which have been heavily penalized  had legitimate hopes in the results of the 1982 Williamsburg Summit of Industrialized! Nations and in the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held recently at Belgrade. Unfortunately  it has to be noted that the results of those two meetings fell short of expectations.262.	If we must wait for the economic recovery to begin and to take shape in the countries of the North for attention to be paid to the position of the countries of the South  then what will happen to the latter as the crisis seems to be increasingly permanent rather than merely temporary? It must be clear to everyone that what is now involved is essentially the structures on which international economic relations are based today. Those structures can no longer support the economic exchanges among States. They must be modified  but that presupposes a meeting of minds.263.	The failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which should have given us another opportunity to restore the North-South dialogue  patently reveals the refusal of the countries of the North to join in such a meeting of minds.264.	Such a refusal will serve only to prolong the crisis. Just as the international community cannot be satisfied for long with a dialogue based on crisis where various proposals merely reflect the situation in certain countries  neither can it be satisfied with negotiations on a sectoral basis. As the crisis is global  a global solution must be found for it. Only global negotiations can get the North- South dialogue out of this impasse and lead it to a new stage on the road towards true international co-operation based on justice and equity.265.	We are still most shocked by the failure of the sixth session of the Conference. But we should like to hope that the countries of the North will understand that it is desperately urgent to adopt emergency measures to deal with the most serious problems of the developing countries. This will be a sign of active solidarity and would be to the credit of mankind.266.	I cannot conclude my statement without addressing to the Secretary-General  to his associates  to international institutions inside and outside the United Nations family and to contributing States the most sincere thanks of the people and Government of the Central African Republic for having responded to the appeal reiterated by the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly for assistance for the reconstruction  rehabilitation and development of the Central African Republic . The recent calamities that have struck my country have seriously disrupted the economy and the fulfilment of the aid programme under way. In order to limit their harmful effects  we alerted the international community at the time and requested emergency action.267.	The Central African Republic is grateful to the Assembly for its attention and it hopes that efforts can be mobilized to increase assistance to it. It is in this spirit that we shall propose  in the Second Committee  the renewal of that resolution and we hope for broad support from Member States.268.	In a constantly changing world  the Organization strives to ensure that its principlesâand only its principles âwill govern international relations. This is a difficult task in view of the real state of affairs but it deserves to be followed up and supported. Born of political will  the United Nations  which suffers the consequences of the political weight of its Member States  should be able to rely on them in order to achieve success in its action.269.	It is thus clear that the state of the world can be only what the States wish it to be: a world free of tension and relations of domination  a world where States  organized in a framework like the United Nations  would engage in concerted  unified and generous action with a view to defending certain values such as freedom  development  prosperity and peace.270.	That is possible. We can achieve that if we want to. Just as a coalition was created to defeat fascism during the Second World War  a similar coalition can be created to adapt international relations to the new shape of the world.271.	This is really what two thirds of mankind expect today from the international community  gathered within the United Nations  which must satisfy their hopes. In this way new prospects would be opened up towards making this century a happier and more pleasant one in which to live."
"25",1196,"CAN",38,1983,"ï»¿27.	 I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I assure you of the full co-operation of the Canadian delegation in the discharge of your duties. You can count on our support in your efforts to enhance the effectiveness of the Assembly  a concern which you emphasized last week in your opening address.28.	I would also like to welcome Saint Christopher and Nevis as the 158th Member of the United Nations. St. Kitts is a hemisphere neighbour  a Commonwealth partner and a close friend to many Canadian visitors.29.	We meet at a time of heightened tension. The urgency of many world problems has intensified since last year. The need for a dynamic United Nations has never been greater.30.	One year ago the Secretary-General inspired us to take a hard look at the Organization. We measured expectations against realities and  to no one's surprise  found ourselves wanting. We recognized that we were in the midst of what the Secretary-General called  in his reports a ""crisis in the multilateral approach in international affairs"". We unanimously agreed on the imperative need to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations. We have not yet succeeded. It is now time to move from high-sounding generalities on which we can all agree to specific measures for strengthening the multilateral system.31.	The reputation of the United Nations is widely measured by its contribution to peace and security. We must turn around the current perception that the United Nations cannot respond forcefully to crisis and conflict. We must make more creative use of the existing provisions and mechanisms of the Charter.32.	The key is the Security Council and the way in which the Secretary-General works with the Council and the members work with each other. Council members have been seeking ways to make the work of the Council more effective. It will be unfortunate if political realities prevent any significant improvements. We count upon the members of the Council  particularly its permanent members  to exercise their responsibilities on behalf of all Member States.33.	Is it naive to demand an enhanced spirit of cooperation and acceptance of responsibilities in the Council? One wonders  in the light of recent events. The world will not soon forget that the Council was prevented from taking action on the destruction of a civil aircraft by the Soviet Union. We cannot write off this particular Soviet veto as a harsh fact of life. This exercise of the veto was callously irresponsible. It prevented the Council from taking action to preserve the safety of international civil aviation.34.	Canadians continue to be outraged by the tragedy of 1 September. On 12 September the Canadian House of Commons unanimously condemned ""the unwarranted attack on and destruction of the Korean airliner on the orders of Soviet authorities"". The House of Commons demanded ""a full and truthful explanation of this brutal act from the Soviet Government"". It demanded that ""the Soviet Government co-operate fully in any impartial investigation under the auspices of the United Nations and of the International Civil Aviation Organization to prevent any repetition of such a tragedy"". And the Canadian Parliament also demanded that ""the Soviet authorities immediately offer full and generous compensation to the families of all victims  including Canadians"". The text of this resolution was distributed on 13 September as a document of the Security Council and is available to all United Nations Members.35.	Canadians are dismayed by the continuing failure of the Soviet Government to respond to official Canadian communications on this matter. A TASS report is an insulting response to a reasonable request for information.36.	One United Nations agency  ICAO  is undertaking an urgent and impartial investigation to determine the facts of the tragedy. It is also reviewing ways of preventing a recurrence of this tragedy. Canadians expect the Soviet authorities to co-operate fully with ICAO.37.	The ineffectiveness of the Council in dealing with the Korean Air Lines incident demonstrates once again the need to find more flexible and creative ways for Council members to address disputes. I would hope that agreement could be reached among Council members on the following specific measures: First  the Secretary- General should be encouraged to make greater use of Ms authority under Article 99 to bring current or potential crisis situations to the attention of the Council. To do this  he requires a greater fact-finding capacity. Secondly  the Council should meet informally to avert potential crises by examining incipient disputes during /n camera sessions with the Secretary-General. Thirdly  the Secretary- General requires additional personnel and resources for more effective use of his good offices in the resolution of disputes.38.	These are not revolutionary steps. They can be taken on the basis of existing authority and by reallocating resources. But they would be useful and concrete and would facilitate the tangible progress on specific problems that is so urgently required. The Secretary-General has shouldered his responsibilities in an exemplary fashion. He does not  however  possess supernatural or  alas  supra-national powers. We  as Member Governments  must also shoulder our responsibilities.39.	The Secretary-General has just reported on one problem crying out for a solutionâthat of Namibia. It is almost five years to the day since the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978). The outstanding issues regarding its implementation have  in substance  been resolved. All the parties have made concessions to achieve this result.40.	There is no excuse now for further delay. South Africa's pre-condition for implementation  the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola  cannot legitimize its illegal occupation of Namibia. The question of principle is clear. Namibia should have its independence regardless of what happens or does not happen in Angola.41.	The Secretary-General has spelt out the political realities very clearly in his report to the Security Council further disastrous consequences will result if we do not quickly reach the stage of implementation  and reaching this stage will require a determined effort by all concerned and particularly by those directly concerned.42.	The first step is clear. South Africa must end its incursions into Angola and its interventions there. It cannot seek unilaterally to reshape the region; boundaries and sovereignties must remain inviolate.43.	Secondly  the President of Angola has reaffirmed that his country has no desire to rely on foreign troops or keep them on its soil once Angola is no longer threatened. Measures to strengthen confidence and lessen tensions between those directly concerned are urgently needed.44.	Thirdly  the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) during 1984 is the essential step. Without this  there cannot be peace in the region. Those who seek peace will meet this challenge.45.	A fourth step should follow. UNCTAD is at present studying Namibia's economic and social needs. The international community will need to provide assistance to an independent Namibia  and Canada stands ready to play its part.46.	The occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union  and of Kampuchea by Viet Nam  persist in defiance of the Assembly's resolutions. The countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  as recently as last week have made constructive proposals aimed at a solution to the Kampuchean situationOn Afghanistan  the Secretary-General and his personal representative have made an effort to get a real dialogue going. The achievement of an equitable solution  however  will require the demonstration of a greater sense of responsibility on the part of the Soviet Union.47.	Canadians have participated in 15 United Nations peace-keeping forces and observation teams. Peacekeeping can be an important part of promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes. The presence of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus  for example  has prevented a recurrence of intercommunal fighting and has helped to maintain law and order. However  there is still no solution to the fundamental problems of the island. The Secretary-General and his representative have recently provided useful ideas on how a settlement can be reached. But until the parties themselves are prepared to make a serious commitment to negotiations  no just and lasting settlement can be found. Peace-making must be seen to go hand-in-hand with peace-keeping.48.	Of course  the alarming course of events in Central America continues to preoccupy us. Political solutions to the region's problems are slow to emerge. For this reason we have welcomed the initiatives of the Contadora Group  working with the five countries of Central America to find a path toward reconciliation. We are convinced that lasting solutions to the region's problems can be arranged only by the countries of the regionâthat approach is fully consistent with the Charter of the United Nations. The Contadora initiative provides a basic framework for stability and co-operation within which the root causes of the region's problems can be attacked more constructively than by military meanings.49.	One factor critical to the success of the Contadora initiative will be a positive response from all parties toPresident Reagan's welcome offer of verifiable demilitarization. There has been some response both from Nicaragua and Cuba but  as yet  no dialogue nor any decrease in military activity. This is essential if an effective settlement in Central America is to be achieved. Canada would support concrete proposals by the Contadora Group to stop the process of militarization and to verify and monitor the progressive withdrawal of all foreign military personnel from the region.50.	Canada is committed to supporting these regional mechanisms. If renewed efforts by the five countries of Central America could lead to agreement among them on a common approach to economic and social planning  Canada would increase its contribution to the necessary regional infrastructure projects. We are more than willing to continue to help all countries there to solve their problems by themselves. But assistance to these countries will be effective only once they have jointly decided to reject outside military involvement. A common effort of this sort could help to restore the political stability and confidence without which programmes for development cannot succeed.51.	Perhaps no issues have more frustrated this Organization than the successive crises in the Middle East. The situation in Lebanon has been particularly tragic. We hope that the cease-fire just arranged will hold. The internal problems of this country have been complicated by others in the region who have chosen  at Lebanon's expense  ruthlessly to pursue their own interests on Lebanese soil. Canada strongly supports Lebanon's sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity. Foreign troops must withdraw unless they are present at the specific request of the legitimate Government of that country. We must all actively support  through the United Nations and by any other means open to us  the search for a just solution based on national reconciliation.52.	Nor can we allow events elsewhere to deflect our attention from the Arab-Israeli conflict. Nothing has occurred in the 12 months since we last gathered to lessen the burning need for a lasting solution which assures the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to a homeland in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. I encourage all parties to exercise restraint. I call on Israel to rethink its policy on settlements. I urge all parties to enter into genuine negotiations. I call on them to make clear  in unambiguous terms  their readiness to accept the right of all States in the area  including Israel  to exist in security and peace.53.	Questions of disarmament and arms limitation have become the central preoccupation of our time. Negotiations between the major Powers have yet to show significant progress. President Reagan's announcement yesterday provides some encouragement that movement may be possible on the question of intermediate-range nuclear weapons. The proposals he advanced are an important step forward and demonstrate a constructive flexibility on the United States side which  we hope  will be matched on the Soviet side 54.	The major Powers have the paramount contribution to make in disarmament and arms limitation. At the same time  we must ensure that multilateral negotiations  under United Nations auspices  serve to reinforce the arms control and disarmament process. Machinery already exists for this purpose  but it has to work more effectively. The Committee on Disarmament  for example  has shown mixed results over the past year.55.	I regret that a working group on arms control and outer space was not established this year by the Committee on Disarmament. Prime Minister Trudeau warned us at the twelfth special session  devoted to disarmament  that ""we cannot wait much longer if we are to be successful in foreclosing the prospect of space wars"". This issue is urgent if we are to succeed in keeping outer space off limits to weapons of war. I commend the Committee's Group of 21 for their recognition of this urgency.56.	Having submitted a substantive working paper on this subject in 1982 Canada has continued its research programme on both the legal and technical aspects. We urge the establishment of a working group early in the 1984 session and are prepared to co-operate fully in the detailed examination of the issues.57.	The Committee on Disarmament did make significant progress in the area of chemical weapons. Thanks to the co-operation extended to the Canadian chairman of the Committee's Working Group on Chemical Weapons  we now have for the first time a complete document which outlines the elements of a convention on the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction. The Working Group has been given the task of undertaking  immediately at the outset of 1984  intensive negotiations on the text of a convention.58.	Canada's concern with the need to eliminate chemical warfare is of longstanding. It goes back to the First World War  when Canadian forces were subjected to the first massive gas attack. Since then  technological developments have made chemical weapons even more pernicious  as events in South-East Asia in recent years have unfortunately demonstrated. It would be a real achievement if a draft convention on chemical weapons could be agreed upon by the end of 1984. We recognize also the absolute necessity of verification if we are going to make real progress in international disarmament and arms control negotiations. Since the Second World War  Canada has attached special importance to the development of international verification mechanisms and has assigned a high priority to research in this area. We have been making available increased funding for research which will help in the technical and practical aspects of verification. We hope that by sharing the results of our work through the Committee on Disarmament we shall make a real contribution to the Committee's effectiveness.59.	Multilateral institutions face the same challenges in the economic as in the political sphere. We have started to meet the challenge. International co-operation has been strengthened through the most intensive round of high- level economic consultations in several years. The series of meetings beginning with the joint IMF/IBRD meeting at Toronto in September last year and moving on to the first ministerial meeting in 10 years of the parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and then to the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries at New Delhi and the Summit of Industrialized Countries at Williamsburg and to the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has been an exhausting but worthwhile experience.6? These consultations have encouraged mutually rein forming national action in a number of sectors. There has been a welcome drop in inflation and nominal interest rates. In the debt area  we have seen an outstanding co-operative effort in handling major simultaneous rescheduling. IMF has performed with vigour and resilience. Developing countries have adopted courageous adjustment programmes to restore their payments equilibrium. International financial institutions and bilateral donors have kept open the flow of resources for development. The GATT ministerial meeting compelled Governments to take a hard look at their own behaviour and elicited renewed commitments to the open multilateral trading system. At the Williamsburg summit the major Western nations agreed on the vital interdependence of the world economy. The developing countries  seriously affected by the world recession  must be full partners in global recovery.64.	There is  of course  no room for complacency. As I stated at the session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at Belgrade  there are no quick fixes to problems which are deep and ingrained in the world economy. To turn this partial and uneven recovery into one that is durable and widespread  we shall need action on many fronts. Continuing efforts are essential to reduce interest rates. In responding to the debt problem  we must ensure an adequate flow of funds to the debtor countries to support their adjustment efforts. Adequate official funds must be made available through IMF and the development institutions  especially to the low-income countries  while commercial banks must continue to play an important role in international financing. The needs of the International Development Association are particularly acute. For its part  Canada has recommitted itself to increasing Canada's official development assistance to 0.5 per cent of the gross national product by 1985 and to make best efforts to achieve 0.7 per cent by 1990. We have today deposited our instrument of ratification of the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities.65.	In trade  the task ahead for our Governments and international institutions is to work together to carry out and monitor the commitments we have already made. It is positive action  not just pledges  that will build confidence in the trading system and contribute to economic recovery. Canada is actively supporting efforts in GATT and elsewhere to monitor commitments to resist protectionism. If individual Governments are to resist protectionist pressures  they need to know that they are engaged in a genuine collective effort and are not simply standing alone. We are mindful of the vital role of trade in the process of global economic development and of the contribution which export earnings can make to relieving severe strains on the payments balance of many countries. These efforts require our attention and resolve.66.	There is another area where co-operation must be nurtured. This is producer-consumer co-operation on petroleum. Repeated energy price shocks have been an important cause of accelerating inflation  lower real growth  the debt crisis and the muting of the North-South dialogue. We are now facing an opportunity for producers and consumers to work together  as a reflection of overwhelming common interests  in conservation and assurance of supply and a fair  stable long-term price. There is now a greater spirit of realism in consumer- producer relations that offers some hope for pragmatic discussion of oil and related concerns in the coming years.67.	The international community has spent far too much time trying to devise new machinery and not enough in making what we have work better. I am encouraged by the pragmatic direction that the debate on reform of the international financial system has taken. The Commonwealth Study Group's report on challenges for the world's financial and trading system represents a most useful recent contribution to this debate. Many of its recommendations are aimed  in the first instance  at bringing about greater multilateral co-operation within the parameters of the present institutional system.68.	The same concernâto make existing institutions work betterâhas prompted the efforts by my country within the Governing Council of UNDP to achieve a more assured system of funding for that institution and to reinforce its role as a central fund for all United Nations technical assistance activities for development. We likewise attach importance to the current triennial review of the operational development activities to the United Nations system. This review provides an opportunity to reassert a coherent sense of purpose and direction to practical co-operation between North and South.69.	I have emphasized the most difficult issues of peace and security and economic co-operation. We should  however  balance our natural concern with these problem areas by recognizing and giving wider publicity to the ongoing achievements of the United Nations system. Too often what has been accomplished has been taken for granted. I should like to cite a few examples.70.	First  the United Nations specialized agencies continue to spearhead international co-operation in many vital technical areas. ICAO is the more recent case in point. It is important for us to ensure that the specialized agencies succeed in preventing extraneous political issues from diverting them from their principal tasks.71.	Secondly  slow but steady progress has been made  since the approval of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  towards the creation of a body of international treaties  mechanisms and procedures which should eventually cover all flagrant violations of human rights. No Government can claim any longer that human rights abuses are solely within their domestic jurisdiction. The work of the United Nations in human rights goes hand in hand with its efforts in the co-ordination of humanitarian assistance to refugees and in cases of natural or man-made disasters. 72.	Thirdly  the United Nations system remains in the vanguard of the progressive development of international law. Pioneering legal regimes have been established in crucial fields such as the law of the sea  outer space  civil aviation  telecommunications and trade. However  if the system is going to keep pace with new developments and technologies  legal considerations will have to take precedence over political objectives.73.	Fourthly  the United Nations system is also actively facilitating international co-operation in coming to grips with the most persistent problems facing society. One innovative proposal  which will be considered by the General Assembly at this session  is for the establishment of an international commission on the environment. The commission would address one of the major challenges facing the international community by studying the impact of economic and social development on the world's environment up to and beyond the year 2000.74.	If the United Nations system is to deal effectively with the panoply of current issues  we the Member States must not stray from the basic ground of the system. Universality of membership remains fundamental to the viability of the system. As stated in Article 4 of the Charter  membership in the United Nations should be open to all peace-loving States which accept the obligations contained in the Charter  and this description certainly applies to the Republic of Korea  which  in its reaction to the calamity of 1 September and in its other actions  has demonstrated clearly its sense of responsibility and its desire for peace.75.	Another basic obligation of membership is that Member States must pay their assessed shares of UnitedNations budgets and resist the temptation to refuse selectively to pay their shares of certain parts of those budgets. Otherwise  the system will be undermined.76.	This week  many heads of State and Government  including my own Prime Minister  are conferring here in New York. They have not lost faith in the multilateral institutions we have so painstakingly constructed. The United Nations system may be far from becoming  as some would hope  a world government which can enforce its decisions. But it is also far from being dominated  as others would have us believe  by a ""tyranny of the majority"". We must dig beneath these slogans. We must reinvigorate our multilateral institutions in practical ways  and  certainly  Canada is prepared to join in activities aimed at reaching that goal. "
"26",1257,"CHL",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 I am indeed gratified to have the opportunity to offer my very cordial greetings to the President of this thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  the Vice President of Panama  Mr. Jorge Illueca  long identified with this Organization  and through him to the people of his country  linked to mine by a warm and enduring friendship.2.	At this session of the Assembly we are witnessing two developments which are of special satisfaction to my delegation: first  the fact that the presidency is held by the worthy representative of a Latin American nation  and secondly  the admission of Saint Christopher and Nevis as a new Member of the Organization  after having solemnly declared its independence on 18 September  the date on which my country also commemorates its birth as a sovereign nation. With the addition of Saint Christopher and Nevis  to whose delegation we offer our best wishes  the number of countries of our region that are determined to contribute to strengthening the principles and purposes of the Charter of San Francisco is thus increased.3.	As a Latin American and as a Chilean  I am particularly happy to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the brilliant and efficient manner in which he has been carrying out his functions  including the negotiating efforts to promote peace and the achievement of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.4.	In my capacity as Minister for External Relations of Chile  the most constructive contribution I can make to this world forum  at a time when difficult circumstances confront the international community  is a brief review of the objectives we pursue  the paths we should take and the resources we have for attaining our goals.5.	Almost 40 years have passed since the solemn signing of the Charter at San Francisco  where the decision to preserve future generations from the scourge of war was sealed. Bodies have been created to achieve that aim and efforts have been made to secure true international co-operation to solve the major political  economic  social and cultural problems affecting mankind.6.	At the same time  scientific and technological development has reached such a point that  together with producing hitherto unknown possibilities  it has placed in the hands of man weapons capable of destroying the species. It is paradoxical that the very human being who has succeeded in reaching the stars has forged the means which could lead to his annihilation.7.	I believe I am not exaggerating if I point out that the risk to our peoples lies in the inability to live in keeping with the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter. While such great advances have been made in the field of science  we have fallen terribly far behind in the unavoidable task of preserving harmony and avoiding aggression.8.	The existing and potential conflicts number in the dozens  and in many cases the smallest countries are mere actors in the disagreements behind which obscure interests of ideological and economic influence are hidden. The threat of major conflagrations hangs over us as the consequence of decisions in which  in many cases  we were not involved. Power protects the powerful  but the blood that stains the earth with its iniquity is not always that of those who created the disputes.9.	For that reason it is necessary to reiterate that the peaceful settlement of disputes  pledged a thousand and one times in texts  speeches and international agreements  must become the rule. This aim has been thwarted because a real will to accept solutions dictated by law or advocated by fairness does not exist.10.	If the use or threat of the use of force is banished from international practice and a decision to respect the law is taken  we shall have gained a world of peace and harmony which will enable man to fulfil the aspirations of progress enshrined in the Charter.11.	We are duty-bound to note with sorrow that  unfortunately  the Security Council has been used many times just for effect  which has led to the distancing of its deliberations from the spirit that led to its creation and to making its resolutions simply repetitive  diverting it from its fundamental responsibility of maintaining international peace and security in the name of the United Nations  that is to say  the international community.12.	For that reason  it is urgent to examine the question of what formula would allow the Organization to follow closely the evolution of certain problems in order to guide them towards peaceful means of preventing and settling disputes in accordance with international law and human rights. Perhaps some form of joint action could be worked out for those unresolved differences which carry the risk of potential confrontation. In this manner there could be timely co-operation in the initial stages with the parties directly concerned  thereby possibly averting confrontation. I cannot help recalling what the representative of Chile said last year in this regard: ""Experience should have taught us only too well that there is a limit  at the transgression of which a thousand diabolical elements will band together to blur understanding and lead to the precipice.'""13.	It is true that in some cases such preventive action could lead to frustration  but then experience  lessons and sometimes great endeavours flow from failures. On the other hand  inaction and inactivity have always proved sterile.14.	We state with conviction that we must not remain unmoved in the face of the clear proliferation of potential or real conflicts. We must never permit a situation such as that in 1945  in which the initiative for and the achievement of international agreement has to emerge from rubble and death. We must prevent a situation in which peace must be created by war; peace must be the child of peace.15.	Because we hold this conviction  my Government today reaffirms  as it has in the past  its unqualified support for the fundamental principles of the Charter  the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for treaties. The best guarantee of peace must be effective juridical instruments which will obviate the temptation to succumb to the misleading attraction and dangerous expedient of force.16.	Coming generations could look towards the future with tranquillity if the United Nations had an efficient mechanism for preventing sterile confrontations.17.	My country has the moral authority to deal with these subjects because of its consistent devotion to peace and its identification with the ideals which led to the creation of the United Nations. In a world which has not been-able to silence the guns of war  we  together with our neighbours  have enjoyed a century-long peace  moving forward successfully along the common paths of understanding and co-operation. For that reason we feel qualified to express our concern about situations which might disturb the peace. If the international community does not face with imagination  creativity and resolution circumstances which constitute risks to peaceâsuch as the events in Central America  the Middle East  Afghanistan and Kampucheaâthe Organization will see the frustration of the dreams and hopes which the nations of the world have held for it since the very moment of its creation.18.	The Chilean Government has pursued tirelessly and patiently  in the peaceful spirit I have recalled  its efforts to ensure harmony in the southern region of the continent.19.	We have always complied with the decisions of international justice  and we welcomed the paternal appeals of His Holiness Pope John Paul II. After accepting the 1977 arbitration finding  compliance with which was obligatory in accordance with a commitment previously agreed to by the parties  we promptly accepted the settlement proposal later worked out by the Holy Father. We have also been prepared to sign a peace treaty  as recommended by the same mediator  to guarantee juridically the harmony fortunately existing between my country and the Argentine Republic.20.	We have not succeeded in securing the culmination of the Holy Father's mediating efforts. In view of the passage of time  we reiterate today our faith in the result of his patient action and express our hope that  thanks to it  our objectives of peace  unity and integration will be achieved.21.	Similarly  we count on the success of the negotiating action entrusted to the Secretary-General in the South Atlantic conflict between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom.22.	The direct threats to peace to which I referred earlier are associated with another danger: the world economic depression. The nations with the most fragile structures are today suffering the consequences of a crisis which is perhaps the worst since the end of the Second World War. We do not wish to shirk our share of responsibility  but we must emphasize that any solution requires the resolute collaboration of the economically strongest countries.23.	What is lacking today is a major consensus for development. From the ministerial meeting of the Contracting Parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to the sixth session of the  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  through the failure of the attempt to renew global negotiations and the difficulties in establishing a viable financing system for science and technology for development  as well as the reduction of all flows of official development assistance  we have gone from disappointment to disappointment  and a crisis of international economic co-operation has been precipitated.24.	We should not turn a deaf ear to these warnings  because history teaches that economic crises constitute the atmosphere in which political tensions and international conflicts thrive.25.	The present situation forces us to recognize the magnitude of the new dimension of interdependence which today defines relations between North and South.26.	But beyond the inevitable tensions and antagonisms a true mutuality of interests exists between the industrialized and developing States. The less developed countries know well that the cause of peace and progress cannot be served by slowing or destroying the growth of the more advanced ones. And the latter cannot but fully recognize their responsibility as partners in the process of world recovery. Both must join forces to make the most of the exploitation of resources in a more equitable and more rational international division of labour  based on the comparative advantages of the various regions. It is appropriate  therefore  to formulate a juridical and political plan for our world  with the participation of all in the determination of new areas of freedom and innovation  based on the cardinal principles of sovereignty  development and peace.27.	An honest and clear distinction must be made between what is desirable and what is possible within today's limited resources. In this context  the programme of action proposed by the Secretary-General during the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development could serve as a good guide for our debates.28.	Now that I have referred to subjects of priority interest  I should like to mention briefly my Government's position on matters of special interest to the General Assembly.29.	The community of nations must not remain indifferent to the occupation by foreign forces of Afghanistan and Kampuchea  where the rights of the peoples are being systematically violated and international juridical norms are being mocked.30.	It is imperative for the Soviet as well as the Vietnamese aggressor  which infringe the most elementary standards of coexistence  to withdraw from those illegally occupied territories so that their peoples can exercise their inalienable right of self-determination.31.	While we unreservedly support the humanitarian work being done on behalf of the refugees  we are concerned at the failure to comply with the resolutions adopted by the United Nations  which constitutes an open violation of the Charter and of international law.32.	Furthermore  it is with serious concern that we witness the crisis affecting our sister nations in Central America. We share with them their desire to preserve their identity and freedom in the face of the disturbing ideologies which an extra-continental Power seeks to introduce into our hemisphere.33.	We have given our firm support to the negotiations of the Contadora Group  and we hope that this initiative will result in a formula which will preserve the values of freedom and human dignity for that part of our continent  which is undergoing a difficult stage in its history.34.	With regard to the situation in the Middle East  Chile has constantly insisted on the need to find a just and lasting solution in keeping with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In our view this objective can be attained only through realistic approaches based on recognition of the right of all States of the region  including Israel  to live within secure and internationally recognized boundaries and on the full exercise by the Palestinian people of the right to self- determination and to establish its own sovereign State.35.	We also feel that the international community would be failing in its duty were it not to succeed in establishing lasting peace in Lebanon. The withdrawal of all foreign forces from that country and respect for its territorial integrity and political independence are indispensable if that once prosperous nation is to recover its unity and the tranquillity necessary for it to begin its speedy and definitive political and material reconstruction. In this regard  the truce recently achieved in Lebanon has aroused our hopes.36.	Inspired by its pacifist calling and its commitment to the idea of good-neighbourliness  Chile will always support initiatives which seek a fair and lasting solution of the complex and delicate situation in the Middle East.37.	I cannot complete these brief references to international matters without placing special emphasis on a situation which Chile  as an active member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  views with great concern. I am referring to the persistence in Namibia of a situation which the entire international community has condemned. In this regard  we wish again to express our complete support for the negotiations which the Secretary- General is conducting in order to find a peaceful solution for this problem which will permit the speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).38.	I also reiterate our repudiation of the practice of apartheid an historic anachronism which is an outrage to the conscience of mankind.39.	Similarly  we continue to deplore the unstable situation in the Korean peninsula. The profound significance of the division of that nation  as far as Chile is concerned  persuades us to support the inter-Korean negotiations more than ever as the only peaceful formula  free of foreign interference  that can lead to a solution of the problem.40.	Furthermore  we energetically denounce the criminal attack upon a Korean civilian plane by Soviet war- planes with the consequent unfortunate loss of life  which is mourned not only by the Korean people but also by Members of the Organization. The contempt for and indifference to the international community and international law shown by the Soviet Union cannot but be condemned.41.	I must also reiterate the concern which my country has indicated on other occasions in this forum with regard to the continued nuclear testing which France is carrying out in the South Pacific. Our firm position is based on the inherent dangers to human life and the flora and fauna of the region. For that reason  we strongly support the signing of a general treaty prohibiting all nuclear tests.42.	Turning to other matters  the issues of outer space  the law of the sea  the Pacific Basin and the Antarctic region are of priority concern to our country.43.	Chile has actively participated in the work being done by the United Nations in the field of outer space  particularly in the search for means of co-operation and in the drafting of juridical instruments regulating the various activities now taking place in this Held.44.	We wish to stress at this time the reception given to the Chilean initiative on the creation of a Latin American space agency. Such a body would permit joint exploitation of the benefits of space science by the member countries  thus making a decisive contribution to their economic  social and cultural development.45.	The signing of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea represents the culmination of long years of effort and negotiation. It is the definitive sanctioning of the concept of an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles  an idea which was originally introduced by my country in 1947.46.	The Chilean Government welcomes the fact that more than 120 Member States have already signed this Convention  and it calls upon those which have not yet done so to give their support to this important instrument of modern international law  the result of the good will displayed by the international community in the process of negotiations.47.	The Chilean Government takes note of the work done by the recent second session of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  and  as Vice-President of that body  we affirm that we will continue actively to co-operate in the implementation of the provisions of the Convention.48.	Chile attaches special importance to the Pacific Ocean  its natural maritime field  which daily demands from the coastal States increasing attention to its inestimable potential  and to the lively dialogue of co-operation which has taken place among the countries of the Basin in recent years.49.	Chile is a Consultative Party to the Antarctic Treaty and its research activity on that continent and the co-operation offered to other Members of the United Nations have been constant.50.	Chile is an Antarctic country by virtue of legal title  history and geographic continuity. The fact that it is a developing country with limited resources has not prevented it from carrying out activities which for more than a century have contributed to linking that continent with the rest of the world  and to the preservation of its unique ecosystem.51.	As a founder the Antarctic Treaty  a Consultative Party and a country that exercises sovereign rights in the Antarctic  Chile cannot be in favour of having this subject discussed in the United Nations.52.	We view with concern the consequences that might occur if this Organization were to undertake the consideration of matters which are the subject of international treaties  open to participation by all States  as is the specific case of the Antarctic Treaty. The twelfth meeting of the Consultative Parties was recently held at Canberra with the active participation of all the adherents.53.	That Treaty  which upholds the principles and purposes of the Charter  has proved to be a unique instrument and an example of international co-operation integrated into the United Nations system and open to all its Members. Those countries with Antarctic activities  including the super-Powers  have found themselves obliged to set aside those matters which separate them and to co-operate peacefully in all areas linked to the Antarctic.54.	For countries such as Chile  which  in addition to century-old activity  exercises its sovereignty in that territory and has its rights protected under article IV of the Treaty  an inadequate consideration of this subject would constitute a violation of Article 2  paragraph 7  of the Charter.55.	Thanks to the existence of the Antarctic Treaty  that region has been preserved as a zone of peace  free from nuclear weapons  far from the traditional confrontations between the great Powers and open to the participation of all States Members of this Organization. The system which has been structured around the Treaty guarantees faithful compliance in the Antarctic with all the aims and objectives of the Charter  in addition to duly safeguarding the interests of humanity.56.	In this session we have heard certain foreign ministers  seeming to follow orders  refer to the internal situation in my country  thus demonstrating a selectivity which we denounce and certainly reject. In some cases their remarks reveal deliberate ignorance and in others a lack of information and even an unacceptable interference in our internal affairs. For this reason only I am compelled briefly to emphasize what is occurring in the process of institutional consolidation in Chile.57.	Early in 1974  in the face of the institutional  material and moral collapse of the country  the Chilean Government solemnly proclaimed that its objective would be centred on full recovery of a lasting democracy. As early as 1277 the necessary stages for gaining normality were structured. At that time there was no lack of prophets arguing that those announcements were merely rhetorical and devoid of real content. The same thing happened at the announcement of the drafting of a political constitution  which  when presented to the nation  received the ratification of two thirds of the Chilean people.58.	In accordance with that same political constitution  Chile today enjoys full freedom of the press  information  assembly and opinion  and the Government has proceeded to implement the political laws which will lead the country to the exercise of the rights of citizens in a full democracy. To bring that about  the Council of State is now working on those laws and its work will be completed in the near future.59.	In order for those basic provisions to have the support of the democratic sectors  the Government has begun a dialogue which is being carried out within a framework of the broadest national representation.60.	The decision to permit the return of Chileans living abroad who had been prevented from returning earlier had a similar integrating direction. During August and September alone  that measure benefited more than 3 000 persons  among them prominent leaders of the political opposition.61.	This responsible pattern of institutional consolidation has not been changed  not even by cowardly assassinations  terrorist acts or acts of vandalism which have been shamelessly claimed by groups of anonymous persons and craven delinquents who  acting under assumed names  are nothing but the concealed armed tools of Soviet imperialism  which contributed to the breakdown of Chilean democratic institutions in the period between 1970 and 1973.62.	In this brief statement I have attempted to bring to the international community represented here the message of friendship which Chile offers to those who respect its identity as a free and sovereign people.63.	Returning always to the idea of peace  I believe that we can find the most precious aspiration of my country at this time in that sentence left us by Milton: ""Peace hath her victories/No less renowned than war"".

"27",1303,"CHN",38,1983,"ï»¿77.	 In the name of the Chinese delegation  I would like to extend to Mr. Jorge Illueca warm congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. His outstanding talent and rich experience have won wide admiration  and I am convinced that under his guidance the session will conduct its work efficiently and handle all its tasks appropriately.78.	I also wish to take this opportunity to express our thanks to his predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the positive contribution he made to the thirty-seventh session.79.	This is the first time I have attended a session of the General Assembly as chairman of the Chinese delegation. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to exchange views with my colleagues here on international issues of common concern.80.	The Chinese delegation extends its warm congratulations to Saint Christopher and Nevis on its recent achievement of independence and cordially welcomes it to the United Nations.81.	Safeguarding world peace is the most important task facing mankind today and the primary concern of all peoples in the world. Working hard for the modernization of their country and the improvement of their living standards  the Chinese people eagerly desire a lasting peaceful international environment. Like other peoples of the world  we are deeply concerned about the maintenance of international peace and security. However  we are compelled to face the harsh realities. The present-day world is far from tranquil and is beset with tensions and turmoil.82.	The fierce arms race between the super-Powers and their wrangling over the question of deployment of medium-range nuclear weapons have kept Europe in a state of tense confrontation. The hegemonists aggression against  and rivalry in  the third-world countries have given rise to frequent wars and emergencies in Asia  Africa and Latin America. Certain developed countries are shifting the consequences of their economic crises onto others  plunging many developing countries into great economic difficulties. All this has caused disasters in many countries and posed a serious threat to world peace.83.	People of all countries have come to realize more and more clearly that world peace can be effectively maintained only be resolutely opposing hegemonism. The numerous third-world countries and the people of the world have strengthened their united struggle against expansion  aggression and power politics  so that the super-Powers have met with ever-stronger opposition and constraints in pursuing their hegemonist policies. We are confident that it is possible to maintain world peace  so long as the people of the world become truly united and wage a resolute struggle against alt manifestations of hegemonism.84.	All the peace-loving countries and people ardently wish to see disarmament realized  and they have expressed this wish in various ways. The massive peace movement that has emerged in some countries in recent years reflects in its main trend the strong aspirations for peace of the people who suffered the havoc of two world wars and are now faced with the increasing threat of a nuclear war. Their aspirations are completely understandable and deserve sympathy.85.	Historical experience shows that a genuine desire for disarmament is essential to real progress in disarmament. Twenty years have passed since the 1963 signing of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water. During this period the two super-Powers have held many disarmament talks and reached some agreements. But what is the result? Their armaments  especially nuclear armaments  have increased in quantity and improved in quality despite all the talks on reduction. Their annual military expenditures amount to more than half of the world's total. More than 95 per cent of the world's nuclear weapons are in the hands of the two super-Powers  which admit that they have long possessed what is commonly known as ""overkill"" capabilities  and it is always the people of the world who are to suffer once these capabilities are put to use. The arms race between superpowers has extended from the land  sea and air to outer space. And the reality is that  for all the disarmament talks  the arms race is intensifying  with each super-Power trying to gain the upper hand over the other. One cannot but question their sincerity for disarmament. Will they give up their nuclear threats and nuclear blackmail to let others live in peace for a while? Without good faith  their words and proposals  however high-sounding and numerous  would in essence only serve to cover up their continued efforts to expand their nuclear arsenals and hoodwink world opinion.86.	As matters now stand  it is only natural that people should ask the two nuclear super-Powers  which possess the largest arsenals  to be the first to reduce their arms  drastically cut their nuclear and conventional armaments and destroy the reduced armaments before there can be any reduction of arms by other countries.87.	China desires peace and favours disarmament. We are for genuine disarmament and against sham disarmament  that is  arms expansion under the camouflage of disarmament talks. The Chinese Government has  together with other third world countries  made unremitting efforts to promote real progress in disarmament.88.	China has always stood for complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China declared explicitly  in 1964  on the occasion of the successful test of its first atomic bomb  that China was developing nuclear weapons for defence purposes and that at no time and in no circumstances would China be the first to use nuclear weapons. China was the first country to propose that nuclear-weapon States should undertake not to use nuclear weapons against each other and was the first country to undertake the commitment not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States or nuclear-free zones. China respects and supports the proposals of non-nuclear-weapon countries for the establishment of nuclear-free zones or zones of peace. China is in favour of reducing conventional armaments as well as nuclear arms. China stands for the early conclusion of a convention on the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of chemical weapons.89.	At the twelfth special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament  China put forward proposals on the question of the nuclear-weapon States ceasing to develop  and reducing  nuclear weapons '"" calling on the two super-Powers to take the lead in adopting practical measures to cut their nuclear weapons and means of delivery by a wide margin. With a view to promoting progress in disarmament  we are prepared to make a further effort by proposing that  after the Soviet Union and the United States have taken practical action to stop testing  improving and manufacturing nuclear weapons and have agreed to reduce by half their nuclear weapons and means of delivery of all types  a widely representative international conference should be convened  with the participation of all nuclear-weapon States  to negotiate the general reduction of nuclear weapons by all nuclear-weapon States. We hope that this proposal will receive a positive response. Thirty years ago  during the Sino-Indian talks in December 1953  the late Premier Zhou Enlai of China  for the first time put forward the five principles of peaceful coexistence; namely mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence. Those principles give expression to the common desire of the peoples of the world to defend their national independence and sovereignty and promote world peace. They are in full accord with the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. Over the past 30 years  these five principles have been accepted by the international community as basic norms guiding the relations between States and have played an important role in maintaining international peace and security. Regrettably  however  peaceful coexistence among States  particularly the independence and security of the third world countries  has constantly been subjected to grave threat and violation by imperialism  hegemonism and colonialism.90.	The Kampuchean issue is  in essence  one of undisguised armed aggression against and military occupation of Kampuchea by the Vietnamese authorities  with the support of a super-Power  in gross violation of Kampuchea's independence and sovereignty. Viet Nam's invasion and occupation of Kampuchea is now more than four years old. It has not only brought untold sufferings to the Kampuchean people but has also posed a grave threat to peace and stability in South-East Asia. Viet Nam has so far refused to withdraw its troops  thus blocking a settlement of the Kampuchean issue which is long overdue. In an attempt to extricate itself from its predicament  Viet Nam has made all kinds of excuses and even described the Kampuchean question as ""an issue between China and Viet Nam"". This is sheer sophistry and slander.91.	The General Assembly has at four successive sessions adopted resolutions by an overwhelming majority  and the International Conference on Kampuchea  held in July 1981  issued a Declaration "" all calling for the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea so that the Kampuchean people may decide their own destiny free from outside interference. How can the Kampuchean issue be described as one involving differences only between China and Viet Nam? Talking about differences  they could be accurately stated as those between the Vietnamese authorities who crudely trample upon the Charter of the United Nations and the international community which firmly upholds it.92.	A number of countries have tried more than once to break the deadlock on the Kampuchean question and bring about a political settlement. On 1 March of this year the Chinese Government put forward its proposal for resolving the Kampuchean question and improving Sino-Vietnamese relations. Like the ASEAN countries and all other peace-loving and justice-upholding countries  China hopes that after the Vietnamese withdrawal Kampuchea will become an independent  peaceful  neutral and non-aligned country and that free elections will be held under United Nations supervision for the Kampuchean people themselves to choose their political system and government leaders. We are prepared to join the other countries concerned in an international guarantee. We also hope that the South-East Asian countries will achieve peace and stability in the region on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. We are willing to develop friendly and good-neighbourly relations with all countries in the South-East Asian region  including Viet Nam. The heart of the matter is that Viet Nam must implement the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea  undertake to withdraw unconditionally all its troops from Kampuchea and act accordingly. This is the prerequisite for a political settlement of the Kampuchean issue.93.	The question of Afghanistan is also a matter of great concern to the international community. Soviet armed aggression against Afghanistan constitutes a gross violation of Afghanistan's independence and sovereignty  which has turned millions of Afghan people into refugees. This is something rare in the modern history of international relations. The international community has strongly called for an immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and full respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan.94.	The Chinese Government firmly supports this just demand. We are in favour of a political settlement of the Afghanistan question  and efforts have been made in many ways by some countries to promote indirect talks through the good offices of the United Nations. However  any political solution must accord with the relevant United Nations resolutions  especially the crucial principle of the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops. The formulation of ""guarantee before withdrawal"" is obviously putting the cart before the horse  and its purpose is none other than legalizing military interference and occupation and putting off withdrawal. We consider that an international guarantee is necessary  and China is prepared to join the other countries concerned in such a guarantee  but this can happen only after  and not before  the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country and the restoration of Afghanistan's independence and sovereignty. At present  a genuine political settlement depend? on whether the Soviet Union will publicly undertake to withdraw its troops and set a timetable for the withdrawal. Failing this  no effort to reach a political settlement will achieve real progress.95.	The situation in the Korean peninsula also arouses concern. The division of Korea into North and South has already lasted for more than years. This not only runs counter to the aspirations of the entire Korean people  but also prevents any easing of tension in this region. The Chinese Government and people wholeheartedly support President Kim 11 Sung's reasonable proposal for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea and the establishment of a Confederal Republic of Korea. The United States should stop interfering in Korea's internal affairs and withdraw forthwith all its troops from South Korea in accordance with the relevant resolution adopted at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly  so that the Korean question may be settled by the Korean people themselves free from interference by outside forces.96.	The situation in the Middle East has been tense and turbulent for years. The crux of the matter is that the Israeli authorities are carrying out wanton aggression and expansion against Arab countries and trampling upon the national rights of the Palestinian people and that their arrogance is inflated by United States partiality. On the eve of the commencement of the General Assembly session last year  Israeli aggressor troops massacred innocent Lebanese and Palestinian civilians in cold blood. As the current session meets here  Lebanon is confronted with the danger of being divided. To justify its aggression and expansion  Israel has kept harping on the need to guarantee its ""security and survival"". But the present reality is that Israel not only arbitrarily frustrates the restoration of the Palestinian people's national rights  but also wilfully threatens the security of Arab countries.97.	The key to safeguarding peace in the Middle East is to stop Israeli aggression. Israel must withdraw from Lebanon and all the Arab territories it has occupied  and the Palestinian people must regain their national rights.98.	Unity among the Arab countries is the fundamental guarantee of success in checking Israeli aggression and expansion and of the settlement of the Middle East question. As a Chinese saying goes  ""Brothers may quarrel at home  but they unite to resist outside attack"". We sincerely hope that the Arab countries and all the Palestinian groups will seek common ground on major issues  while setting aside minor differences  and strengthen their unity in the joint struggle against the enemy. The Chinese Government and people will as always firmly stand by the Arab people and support their just struggle. We are deeply convinced that all aggressors will be punished in the long run. Final victory will definitely belong to the united Arab people.99.	The South African authorities have persisted in their racist policies  continued their illegal occupation of Namibia and carried out repeated armed incursions and military provocations against neighbouring countries. Here lies the root cause of the turbulent situation in southern Africa. Peace and tranquillity in that region require resolute sanctions against the racist South African authorities and the achievement of Namibian independence in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. It is totally unjustified to attempt to link Namibian independence with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola  as those are issues of different natures. What ground is there for obstructing the independence of one country by citing the presence of foreign troops in another? The people of Namibia strongly demand independence at an early date. They have carried out a prolonged struggle under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization No force on earth can block the independence and liberation of Namibia.100.	The conflict in Chad is becoming more and more complicated because of the meddling of external forces. The majority of African countries are in favour of seeking a settlement through the OAU. They want to eliminate intervention by external forces and call for a settlement of the internal dispute in Chad through negotiations. The Chinese Government supports this justified position. We believe the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Chad should be respected  its internal affairs should be settled by the people of Chad themselves and all foreign intervention must cease forthwith.101.	The tension in Central America has further escalated in the past few months. It is impermissible to attempt either to use military Muff to restrict the struggle of the people in Central America for democracy and social reform or to carry out infiltration by exploiting the national and democratic movements there. We consistently hold that the problems of the Central American countries should be solved by the people of the respective countries  that disputes between Central American States should be settled peacefully on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and that no external forces should be allowed to intervene. The Chinese Government supports the Contadora Group and the Latin American countries in their position against the super-Powers' attempt to involve Central America in their rivalry and confrontation and in their endeavour to uphold the right of the Central American peoples to self-determination and ease the tension in Central America. The issue of the Malvinas Islands remains a matter of public concern. We maintain that Argentina's claim to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands must be respected by the international community and that resolution 37/9  adopted at the last session of the General Assembly  must be implemented.102.	In the face of the tense and turbulent world situation  we call on all States strictly to observe the basic principles of peaceful coexistence in their mutual relations and resolutely condemn and halt any acts that violate these principles so as to uphold the purposes of the Charter and promote the noble cause of world peace and human progress.103.	The question of development is one of the most important issues of our time. It has a direct bearing not only on the effort of the developing countries to safeguard their national independence and develop their national economy but also on the world economy as a whole and international pence and security. Many countries in Asia  Africa and Latin America have now entered a new historical period of bolstering their political independence with economic independence. Although they have achieved some gratifying results in their economic development  they have also come across serious difficulties. In particular  under the impact of the world-wide economic crisis  some developed countries have tried to get rid of their own troubles by shifting the consequences of the crisis on to others. This has wrought havoc among the developing countries  and many of them are faced with economic situations grimmer than any since their independence. We hope that these developed countries will become more farsighted  for all countries are closely linked in their economies  and the economies of the developing countries constitutes an important part of the world economy. If their economic difficulties are not resolved or  worse still  are aggravated  the entire world economy is bound to suffer. In trying to harm others these developed countries will end by harming themselves and will find it difficult to achieve a steady recovery and growth in their own economies.104.	Last April it was pointed out at the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held at Buenos Aires  that the crisis confronting the world economy today is structural as well as periodic. The Group called on the international community to make the maximum effort to seek a global settlement and work out a set of mutually complementary and coordinated policies and measures on a short-term as well as a long-term basis. The Chinese Government supports the series of concrete proposals put forward by the Group of 77 for this purpose. It has become an increasingly urgent task to take emergency measures in the fields that are vital to the developing countries and carry out the necessary reforms in international economic relations. We always maintain that the long-term objective of establishing the new international economic order should be linked with the solution of the immediate urgent problems. In order to promote North- South dialogue and break the present deadlock  it was proposed at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in Match  that global negotiations be carried out in phases and that some problems in specific fields be chosen as the basic content of the first-phase negotiations. This proposal is quite reasonable  but it has not been accepted by the major developed countries. The just proposal of the Group of 77 also failed to win positive response from the developed countries at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held not long ago. We hope that the major developed countries  and the United States in particular  will change their rigid position in response to the wishes of the developing countries and display sagacity and goodwill in promoting North-South negotiations and improving North-South relations.105.	While North-South dialogue is at a stalemate  South-South co-operation is making steady progress. This co-operation is new in international economic relations. A sure way to economic prosperity and greater economic strength for the developing countries is to expand South- South co-operation  embark on collective self-reliance  build up independent national economies and reduce dependence on developed countries. The strengthening of South-South co-operation  of course  does not replace North-South dialogue  nor is it intended to lighten the commitments of the developed countries towards the developing countries. But it can serve as a stimulus to North-South dialogue. China  being a developing socialist country and a member of the third world  has had historical experience similar to that of other third world countries and is faced with a similar task.106.	For the purpose of developing China's economic relations with foreign countries and strengthening South- South co-operation  Premier Zhao Ziyang  in his recent visit to Africa  put forward four principles  namely  ""equality and mutual benefit  stress on practical results  diversity in form  and attainment of common progress"". We are prepared  in accordance with these principles  to explore with other developing countries ways for active co-operation.107.	China is ready to work together with other countries for the defence of world peace  in the interest of smooth progress in its modernization programme and of its national security and in the fundamental interests of the people of the world. We will steadfastly pursue an independent foreign policy. We are opposed to all acts of hegemonism. We are striving to maintain and develop normal relations with all countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence and will persist in a long-term policy of opening to the outside world on the basis of self-reliance. We attach special importance to strengthening our unity and co-operation with the other third-world countries. We support the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries  which is playing an increasingly important role in maintaining world peace. With unflagging interest we have done our best to develop good-neighbourly and friendly relations with our neighbouring countries. We are steadily promoting our good relations with the developed countries in Western Europe  North America and Oceania. We are striving to improve and strengthen our relations with the East European countries. As for the United States and the Soviet Union  we also hope that the obstacles in our relations with them can be removed and normal relations maintained and developed in accordance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence. We believe that this will not only benefit the people of various countries but is also in the interest of world peace.108.	As a founding Member  China has always attached importance to the role of the United Nations. We have noted that  thanks to the joint efforts of Member States and particularly those of the third world  the United Nations has in recent years played a positive role in the maintenance of international peace and security  in decolonization and the promotion of economic development. However  we cannot but point out that many of the correct resolutions adopted by the United Nations have not been implemented; as a result  it has become rather weak in the settlement of many important issues. The permanent members of the Security Council have a special responsibility to remedy this regrettable state of affairs. We appreciate the suggestions made by the Secretary-General in his annual report for the strengthening of the role of the United Nations. We support the views put forward by the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries regarding the democratization of international relations. Together with other countries  we will strive to enable the United Nations to play a more positive and useful role in realizing the purposes and principles of its Charter. "
"28",1383,"CMR",38,1983,"ï»¿85.	 It is a privilege  a great honour and a genuine pleasure for me to be here in this aula magna of the United Nations  a sanctuary dedicated to the pursuit of peace.86.	After the great historic changes that have taken place in the administration of the Cameroonian State  I feel privileged to be mandated to bring you our message  a message which can only be one of peace. How can it be otherwise  when in spite of superficial disturbances  quickly calmed  my country remains stable  resolutely pursuing its development in unity and peace  which we dearly cherish and which the entire people of Cameroon intends to guard jealously? How can it be otherwise  when we also know that President Paul Biya  on assuming high office  chose the twin themes of commitment and loyalty as the hallmark of his mandate? His commitment is to the construction of a society that is democratically governed  with stability and peace  a deep peace for hearts and minds  a society whose primary concerns are the well-being  freedom and happiness of all the people of Cameroon.87.	Certain as he is of the complete  unfailing support of all the vital forces in Cameroon  regardless of race  tribe  religion or region  the President of the Republic has promised his people that he will keep that solemn commitment.88.	The other theme is that of loyalty: loyalty to our friends old and new; loyalty to the principles of the charter of the Organization of African Unity; loyalty to genuine non-alignment  the only way to preserve our independence and make it possible for us to contribute effectively to promoting peace and justice in international relations; and loyalty to the principles and ideals of the United Nations.89.	As I reiterate those inspiring words of commitment and loyalty spoken by President Paul Biya  may I  his Minister for Foreign Affairs  take this opportunity to reaffirm before the Assembly the pledge of loyalty and commitment of Cameroon  my country  to the common struggle of all peoples of the world for the safeguarding of the noble ideals of mankindâpeace  independence  justice  co-operation in equality and progress for all countries.90.	At this point may I associate myself with the eminent speakers who have preceded me in congratulating Mr. Jorge Illueca  on behalf of my delegation  on his election. We welcome that choice because through his country it honours the whole of Latin America  which because of its cultural and human affinities with my continent is so near to Africa. There can be no doubt that our work will benefit from his wisdom as a statesman and his faith in the United Nations. I should like to assure him of the complete co-operation and support of my delegation in the accomplishment of the tasks of his high office as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.91.	It is also a pleasure for me on this occasion to thank Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary for the competence and objectivity with which he guided the work of the thirty- seventh session.92.	We should like also to pay a particular tribute to the Secretary-General and to express our appreciation to him for his tireless efforts  made with courage  foresight and self-sacrifice  in the exercise of his delicate functions. We also express our gratitude to him for the dedication and clarity of mind that he has placed at the service of the international community. Lastly  we welcome his contribution to the strengthening of international cooperation.93.	I should like most warmly to welcome the delegation of Saint Christopher and Nevis and to congratulate it on its admission as the 158th Member of the United Nations.94.	We have said from the outset that we are gathered here in the temple of peace  a peace without which it is impossible for us to build the future  but we view with concern the many challenges and obstacles on the road to peace and to the future.95.	We are indeed aware of the seriousness of the world situation and the dangers threatening mankind. International  political and economic relations are in a state of serious crisis which  because of its global nature and its complexity  is unprecedented in recent history and places at stake our vital interests  namely peace  independence and development. Hence what we have always affirmed is confirmed today at the world level as an irrefutable truth and as a warning: the way in which blocs perceive international relations and world security cannot guarantee the realization of any of those noble goals. That is why these sessions of the General Assembly always arouse great hopes in the world and why we bear such a heavy responsibility.96.	We are meeting here  it should be recalled  at a time when the world requires drastic changes in order to live in peace and security. The solution of the present crisis must be sought through genuine democratization of international relations. This implies on our part a more determined struggle against all policies of domination that seek by every means to preserve acquired privileges and to perpetuate conditions of inequality in the world. Those policies are  in effect  one of the causes of tension in all areas of international relations. The ensuing rivalries  the threats to the independence of countries  the escalation of the arms race and the worsening of the world economy are the major obstacles to the settlement of all these crises which confront us today.97.	The major Powers obviously have an important role in questions of peace and security. None the less  in a world characterized by interdependence and a shared destiny  it is essential that all international protagonists co-operate on an equal footing. Responsibility for the future of mankind cannot be left in the hands of a small circle of countries  however large and powerful they may be.98.	As I have said  the struggle for peace and security  independence and development remains our purpose today as it has in the past. When we speak of peace we are not thinking only of the absence of war  a situation maintained by the balance of force and terror. The peace to which we refer is broader; it is universal. That peace is inseparable from freedom and development in independence. There can be no stable peace in conditions of confrontation and rivalry between blocs  the terrible arms race  the deepening of economic and social inequalities. In other words  the struggle for peace  which requires renewed co-operation  must be waged on several fronts: the stopping of the arms race  the relaxing of international tensions and the search for adequate solutions to the present economic crisis.99.	It is to those different aspects that I should like to devote my statement.100.	As a non-aligned country  Cameroon has always attached the greatest importance to questions of disarmament  deeply convinced that peace and security cannot be built in the shadow of weapons. Without disarmament there can be neither lasting peace nor development with security. It is encouraging to see that world public opinion  by and large  shares this feeling. However  the absence of the necessary political will on the part of the major Powers and their mutual mistrust have been and remain the principal obstacles to any effective negotiations. This was also the essential cause of the failure of the twelfth special session of the General Assembly  the second devoted to disarmament.101.	In the present international context it cannot be repeated too often that the beginning of a process of disarmament is of primary importance. Never in the course of its history has mankind been exposed to so serious a threat as the arms race today between the big Powers and the blocs. The danger of a nuclear cataclysm has in recent days been felt even more because of the emergence of the concept of the possibility of limited nuclear wars. It is in the shadow of that danger that a wide-ranging race is continuing also in the field of conventional weapons  the UK of which in many local or regional wars increasingly threatens world peace and the independence of a large number of countries.102.	It is therefore essential that the United Nations should not only consider the nature and consequences of the arms race but also and above all promote the adoption of concrete measures for putting an end to it. Here we have in mind the conclusion between the two superpowers of agreements on strategic nuclear weapons and on the missiles in Europe. We are also referring to the need for treaties on the complete prohibition of nuclear tests and the prohibition of chemical weapons. Lastly  we have in mind the need to embark on global negotiations on nuclear and conventional disarmament issues. The preparation and adoption by the General Assembly of a programme of disarmament would be an appreciable contribution to that end.103.	Cameroon  for its part  will continue to support all initiatives aimed at opening disarmament negotiations. Here we recall that only determined and united action by all members of the international community can ensure progress in this Held. Such action requires strengthening the role of the United Nations. That is the sense and the spirit of the New Delhi Message adopted at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  which Cameroon fully supports.104.	It is self-evident that at the present time the first step towards peace must be the relaxation of international tension. Cameroon has always stressed that. Detente must be general; it must cover every region in the world and all forms of international activity. Such a process presupposes the renunciation of threats  of the use of force  of intervention and interference  an end to all forms of aggression  withdrawal from occupied territories and the final elimination of colonialism and racism. These are all goals of the Organization. They are also questions on which we must now  more than before  take a clear stand and define the framework for our action. It is now more than ever before an imperative  since we know that in 1983 no significant progress has been achieved in solving the different crises which have been affecting the world for years  even decades. Today  no region of the world enjoys complete security and peace. The policy of force  interferes  pressures and overt aggression are the reason. Bloc rivalry and interference considerably delay settlement of these crises by peaceful means with respect for the rights and interests of the peoples and countries directly concerned.105.	This is the case in Africa  on which history has imposed many hardships. At a time when the OAU is making patient efforts to root out the terrible evils of colonialism  racism and their surrogates  Africa today is exposed to threats of division and to ever-growing external pressure. This is a deep-rooted and  dangerous process  an attempt to make use  for purposes alien to the interests of Africa  of certain difficulties and problems inherited by African countries. Cameroon is convinced that by uniting their efforts  the African countries will manage to preserve the unity of the OAU  whose role is irreplaceable in the struggle of Africa for freedom  for more rapid economic and social development  in short  for mastery of its own destiny.106.	The tragedy which the people of Chad have experienced for more than a decade now is a source of deep and constant concern to my country  as the situation deteriorates and becomes daily more complex. The position of Cameroon  denned since the very beginning of the crisis and reaffirmed recently by the President of the Republic  Paul Biya  is well known. Loyal to the principles of sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States  my country remains convinced that the problem of Chad must be resolved by peaceful means. This is why it remains our hope that weapons will be silenced and a process of negotiations will begin. To that end  all citizens of Chad at home and abroad must tear down the barriers that they have erected or encouraged and which prevent peace in Chad. We hope that the legal Government in N'Djamena will find appropriate ways and means to open up dialogue and to call upon all the vital forces of the Chadian nation to enter into a covenant of fraternity with honour.107.	Cameroon  in any case  reaffirms its readiness today  as in the past  to contribute to any concerted action aimed at restoring peace to Chad  national reconciliation  and the reconstruction of that neighbouring fraternal country which has been ravaged by so many years of war. In this respect  we feel that the OAU has a primary and irreplaceable role to play in Chad in the quest for peace and unity.108.	In the Western Sahara  the deterioration of the situation characterized by the heightening of armed confrontation constitutes a source of deep concern. In the view of my delegation  the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the OAU  adopted by its Assembly of Heads of State and Government at Nairobi in 1981 and at Addis Ababa in 1983  constitutes a valid basis for the search for a political settlement of the Western Sahara conflict based on a cease-fire and the organization of a referendum of self-determination under the auspices of the OAU and the United Nations.109.	Cameroon is also concerned at the situation in southern Africa  where  because of South Africa apartheid and the colonization of Namibia still constitute two sources of violence  two causes of humiliation for the African people and two major challenges to the international community.110.	From the moral standpoint  we can never repeat too often that apartheid remains a most repulsive and condemnable philosophy because it is the only example of an institutionalized policy of racial discrimination. An exclusively white minority Government has arrogated to itself all political power and 80 per cent of the wealth of the country  thanks to an extraordinary arsenal of evil laws and a most barbaric form of repression. South Africa  therefore  is the only country in the world where 85 per cent of the population is officially deprived of all political and economic rights and even the most basic human rights.111.	This situation is untenable. Untenable also are the deceptive reforms promised or implemented by South Africa  because they are designed to keep the black population  which is in the overwhelming majority  on the fringes of society. That is why Cameroon  a member of the OAU Co-ordinating Committee for the Liberation of Africa  will continue to help the liberation movements in their struggle against apartheid and for the promotion in South Africa of a multiracial society which respects the dignity and equality of all its members.112.	The question of Namibia is the second part of the South African regime's insolent defiance of the international community since 1966. Cameroon has followed with the greatest misgivings the negotiations that have gone on for several years now with the Pretoria authorities  with whose duplicity and basic disdain for the norms  principles and ideals of international society we are all familiar. South Africa looks upon these negotiations with the Secretary-General or with the western contact group only as a delaying tactic  an exercise to gain time. For Pretoria  which was worried at the collapse of the protective buffer formed by the European colonies around its borders  Namibia represents the last line of defence before the winds of freedom sweep away that bastion of apartheid.113.	How long will the international community be deceived by the delays and subterfuges of dictated by a total rejection of the values of civilization that constitute the pride of our day?114.	Cameroon  for its part  remains devoted to Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978)  which define the only acceptable framework for the independence of Namibia. Any policy aimed at creating a link  a parallel or reciprocity between the application of those resolutions and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola is inadmissible and constitutes unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign State. The self-determination and independence of Namibia are inalienable rights of the Namibian people  recognized and solemnly affirmed by the General Assembly three decades ago. Their exercise and their observance should be neither delayed nor compromised by considerations that relate solely to the hegemonic struggle of the super-Powers.115.	A member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Cameroon will continue to support in every way the heroic struggle of the Namibian people for genuine independence under the leadership of SWAPO  its sole legitimate representative.116.	We appeal to the Powers friendly to Pretoria to compel it  while there is still time  to heed the voice of wisdom and of reason. Any policy based on racial injustice and supported by violence and repression can only lead to tragedy and endanger the peace and security of all society. We direct our appeal in particular to all those people who know the high cost of freedom because they themselves made the greatest and most noble sacrifices for it.117.	But given the political short-sightedness and the bad faith that characterizes the white minority in Pretoria  the Security Council  in order to make its decisions respected  should resort to the collective measures given it by the Charter  including the provisions under Chapter VII.118.	The Middle East region continues to be the most dangerous hotbed of crisis in the world. This situation results from the expansionist policy of Israel  which for many years now has been endangering the freedom and sovereignty of neighbouring countries and brutally denying the elementary national and human rights of the Palestinian people. The occupation of a large part of Lebanon  the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinians  the annexation of the Golan Heights and Jerusalem and the preparations for the appropriation of the West Bank and Gaza confirm that the deliberately intransigent orientation of Israeli policy remains unchanged.119.	It is impossible to stifle the liberation struggle waged by the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  its sole legitimate representative. In this regard we reaffirm our constant support for that heroic people and our profound hope that the Palestinian leadership will transcend its internal dissensions and regain that coherence which has always been its strength.120.	The United Nations  today more than ever before  must play a decisive role in ensuring a comprehensive political settlement of the Palestinian question and the Middle East crisis.121.	We have long since approved the bases of such a settlement. There can be no just and lasting solution without Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967  without recognition of the right of all the States in the region  including Israel  to live in peace within secure and recognized international borders and without the achievement of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and to its own independent State in Arab Palestine.122.	It is essential to guarantee the participation of the PLO in all the negotiations concerning the destiny of the people it represents. This is also the only means of achieving lasting peace for all the States of the region. The proposals of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez  and the recent decisions of the Palestine National Council are an important contribution to the search for a solution to the Middle East crisis and the problem of Palestine. We equally appreciate the other initiatives that respect the national rights of the Palestinian people. But any new advance necessarily requires an end to all support for and encouragement of Israel's intransigent policy.123.	Following the invasion of Lebanon  a second prerequisite has become obvious to everyoneâthat is  the restoration of the authority of the Lebanese Government over its entire territory. For that purpose it is essential that the Israeli occupation forces and all the foreign troops withdraw from Lebanon  that foreign Powers refrain from further interference in the internal affairs of that non-aligned Arab country. In this context  Cameroon is pleased at the extension of the mandate of UNIFIL  an important element in bringing stability and peace to the region.124.	But this is only a palliative. The Middle East problem as a whole ran be solved only through broad negotiations in the framework of the United Nations and with the agreement of the great Powers and with the effective participation of all the parties to the dispute  including the PLO.125.	In addition to these long-standing situations so fraught with danger to peace and security  there are new crises caused by foreign intervention in the Mediterranean and in South-West Asia. Cameroon's position in this respect is clear and consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.126.	In Cyprus the two communities could find a Held for understanding that would preserve their respective interests and the independence  integrity and unity of this non-aligned country if foreign Powers would once and for all refrain from interfering in the country's internal affairs. Cameroon will continue to support any initiatives towards promoting brotherly dialogue between the two communities concerned in order to restore peace to the island and guarantee the sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus.127.	We recognize the legality of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea. We believe that a solution to the present situation can and must be found through a political settlement including the withdrawal of foreign troops and the cessation of all foreign interference so that the people of Kampuchea may decide freely and in all sovereignty on the means for its own development.128.	With regard to a settlement of the problem of Afghanistan  it is highly important in this case too to enable the people of the country to decide its own destiny freely. This presupposes the withdrawal of foreign armed troops  the prohibition of outside interference and the return of the refugees. We welcome all the constructive efforts undertaken in that direction  and we particularly appreciate the good offices of the Secretary-General.129.	We deplore the recent destruction of the Korean Air Lines civilian aircraft. This not only has cast a pall over the already tense relations between the blocs but has also caused the death of hundreds of innocent persons. We wish once again to express here our deep sympathy to the bereaved families and LO the Korean people.130.	The aggravation and perpetuation of these situations that we have just mentioned result  let us not forget  in the appearance of that new category of persons forced to wander through the world without shelter  without a homeland and without possessionsâthat is  refugees. There are at present about 10 million in the world  more than half of them in Africa. This flow of refugees creates problems for the host countries  which for the most part are developing countries already concerned with problems of their own survival.131.	We hope that the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  to be held in 1984  will conduct a precise evaluation of the results of the first conference  provide increased resources to alleviate the plight of these refugees and give new impetus to the search for ways and means to find a long-term solution to this problem.132.	In speaking of the suffering endured by peoples of Africa  Asia  Palestine and Lebanon and the heroic struggle they are waging  we cannot but make an urgent appeal to the international community. For all these peoples expect the United Nations to demonstrate active solidarity with them  mobilizing the Organization's considerable means and influence. They expect the United Nations to contribute to the restoration  once freedom has been regained  of a just and lasting peace in all these regions.133.	Peace and security do not allow for the transfer to our countries of conflicts stemming from the confrontation between the big Powers. Still less can peace and security accommodate the greed and the designs  clearly apparent today  of which our countries are the targets and which awaken the memories of an era that we had thought long past.134.	The peace to which mankind aspires cannot exist if its benefits are not extended to all the peoples of the world; it requires respect for the independence of every country and the free expression by every people of its national will.135.	To be maintained  peace requires active and balanced co-operation within the framework of a renewed and more democratic system of international relations; it requires the creation of an international atmosphere favourable to equal economic and social development for all. That is the essence of this new international economic order which must be established without delay.136.	How can we not regret that our developed partners still do not want to hear us and persist in believing that through a series of corrective measures they will be able to overcome the present crisis  which  we must recall  is a structural one. It stems from the inadequacy of post-war international institutions. Because of various changes that have taken place since then in the configuration of the international community  those institutions are outdated and have revealed their limits  both conceptual and structural. It is this new fact that is causing deep disorder in the international economic machinery. That is why  however useful the corrective measures adopted may be  they still fall short of the urgent large-scale measures that must be taken for the recovery of the world economy.137.	Despite the emergency measures taken here and there  the international economic situation remains disquieting.138.	No decisive breakthrough is expected before 1985 in the States members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Moreover  according to forecasts of some specialized agencies  including IMF  the Western countries as a whole will not this year reach the 3 per cent growth rate which is considered the threshold for any viable economic recovery.139.	The manifestations of the crisis  which are the present massive unemployment  affecting millions of persons  trade confrontations and endemic inflation  remain serious in themselves.140.	The situation in the developing countries  where absolute poverty is the daily lot of millions of persons  deteriorates day by day because of those countries' growing indebtedness  the continuing deterioration in terms of trade and the protectionist measures that exhaust their export earnings. For many of them the basic question today is not one of being better off  but rather one of simple survival. Recent reports of the World Bank and IMF are particularly enlightening in this connection. It is therefore easy to understand our disappointment at the level of official development assistance and the insignificant results of major international conferences in this connection.141.	We are deeply concerned at the depletion of the resources of multilateral organizations that work for development. Although we are pleased by the recent increase in IMF quotas and the broadening of general loan agreements  our anxiety persists. Apart from the fact that measures must be ratified in order to be effective  which takes a long timeâthe example of the Common Fund for Commodities is enlightening in this respectâ the agencies of the United Nations system are in a critical financial situation. Some of them are now moving from recession to depression. This is the case in particular with UNDP  whose resources have decreased by 50 per cent. All of this endangers the realization of many projects  especially in Africa.142.	The failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development also attests to the dangerous deterioration of the spirit of international co-operation. Of course  it did manage to adopt a few resolutions in favour of the Common Fund  as well as some measures concerning the conclusion of agreements on certain commodities and some international arrangements to stabilize prices. This was only a reaffirmation of an existing consensus. On the other hand  the Conference did not reach agreement on substantive problems  in particular the causes of the present crisis and ways of overcoming it.143.	For the same selfish reasons  the new United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  the result of more than 10 years of laborious negotiations  is now the object of manoeuvres aimed at obstructing its implementation. Certain developed countries are no longer concealing their bitter disappointment at the lack of cooperate and solidarity which has become evident within the restricted framework of the summit meetings of the industrialized countries that share the same philosophy and are linked by many agreements.144.	The signs of recovery that have emerged in certain developed countries do not reveal any sustained and lasting growth. Even if this recovery strengthens in those countries  its effects on the economy of the developing countries seems uncertain  the so-called locomotive theory having shown its limits through the present machinery governing the world economy.145.	The persistence and deepening of the present economic crisis show that it is futile to try to overcome  through piecemeal measures or expedients unilaterally worked out and applied  a crisis which is both profound in its effects and global in its scope. Hence  in this era of interdependence the only way to overcome the crisis is through a global  integrated approach both to the analysis of situation and in the search for solutions. This is the very basis of the patiently developed global negotiates project  the opening of which is unfortunately blocked by the unjustified hesitation of a tiny minority of rich countries which are excessively attached to the present archaic economic system  and this endangers international peace and security. This project appears more than ever to be the most appropriate framework  because the approach to a global challenge to the international community must be global.146.	There is not and will never be any security based on exploitation and the impoverishment of the third world. Development is and will remain the key to peace. That is why we renew here our appeal  the appeal of the non-aligned countries for collective action for world prosperity. Will this appeal at least be heard? We venture to hope that it will. We hope this most sincerely  because the tragic situation now prevailing  the present crisis  demands this.147.	Our support for world-wide co-operation cannot conceal our deep conviction that the task of development is in the last analysis a matter for the national will and our own efforts. Thus Mr. Paul Biya has said: Our common task is to persist with ever-increasing determination in our national development effort; to develop a strategy that will make it possible to bring about social change; to modernize our structures and make them factors in increasingly self-reliant  endogenous and balanced development. 148.	But our internal dynamics  our efforts to achieve ethical development and to make the best and most rational use of our resources will not be enough  we well know  if an unfavourable international environment systematically nullifies what we have worked so hard to achieve.149.	Having described from this rostrum its vision of international relations  Cameroon has tried to make its own contribution to the search for suitable means of guaranteeing peace and security  which are so gravely threatened  by recourse not to weapons but to co-operation. Could there be any more appropriate forum in which to do this than that of the United Nations  which was established precisely to safeguard these ideals and to strengthen co-operation among nations in order to guarantee for all an equal chance of achieving well-being?150.	In the face of the persistence of colonialism  the increase in hotbeds of tension  the growing inequality among nations and the erosion of the spirit of co-operation  there is a great temptation today to question the capacity of the United Nations to fulfil its essential mission. Indeed  its Secretariat shows signs that its means of action are insufficient.151.	The Security Council  the supreme body for the safeguarding of our collective peace and security  is consistently paralyzed because of the immoderate use of the right of veto possessed by some of its members. Those that enjoy decisive influence in international relations and should therefore act for the common good too often find their judgment clouded by their own interests.152.	The time has therefore come to revitalize the Council. The authority of the United Nations depends on it. That is why Cameroon reiterates its appeal for the convening of a special meeting of the Security Council  as proposed by the Secretary-General at the thirty-seventh session. We hope that the members of the Council entrusted with considering this question will give the matter priority and propose positive measures as soon as possible. We will continue to support the expansion of that Council  as we have in the past  since this is necessary because of the new geopolitical configuration of the world.153.	It is high time to make it possible for the United Nations to organize effective solidarity among all peoples  to co-ordinate and promote development  to bring order to world economic relations  in accordance with the principles and objectives of the new international economic order.154.	By committing ourselves to that process we shall be restoring credibility to the United Nations  enhancing its prestige and meeting the three-fold challenge that we face: to be worthy of the architects of this Organization  who  learning from the sufferings of the wars of the past  dreamed of harmony and peace; to meet the expectations of present generations for a better life; and to respond to the aspirations of the poor to freedom  progress and well-being  to their urgent appeal for greater justice.155.	Only in this way  as stated by Mr. Paul Biya  will the United Nations  remain not only an enlightening and stimulating moral authority  but also a force for the benefit of the harmony  development and betterment necessary for peace  liberty and progress in a difficult world  an instrument for the solution of such major international problems as those of disarmament  the situation in the Middle East  southern Africa  the resumption of the North-South dialogue  the just distribution of the riches of our world.  "
"29",1425,"COD",38,1983,"ï»¿173.	First of all  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of Zaire and on my own behalf  I warmly congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.174.	It gives me particular pleasure to see you presiding over the work of the General Assembly because you are a son of the third world  a statesman well versed in the arena of international life and closely acquainted with the United Nations. Your political and diplomatic experience  together with your thorough knowledge of the workings of the United Nations  are  we believe  an earnest of the success of our deliberations  which are taking place in an international context which is complex and difficult in all respects. I assure you of the wholehearted co-operation of the delegation of Zaire.175.	I should also like to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  for the distinction with which he conducted the work of the thirty-seventh session.176.	Lastly  I should like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his outstanding report on the work of the Organization. It contains a lucid and detailed analysis of the major problems of international concern  of positions taken and of courageous suggestions made. It bears the imprint of special concern for international peace and security  law  co-operation and particular attention to the development of the countries of the third world. Indeed that is so because he is convinced that the prosperity of the North  and indeed the recovery which has been glimpsed in the industrialized countries  cannot continue without an increased effort for the benefit of the developing countries in the southern hemisphere.177.	We have noted with particular satisfaction all the efforts made by the Secretary-General to enable the United Nations to fulfil the vital role it is called on to play to safeguard peace and security in the world and to bring about a new ethic based on greater sensitivity  solidarity and harmony in relations among nations and peoples.178.	I should also like most warmly to welcome the new State of Saint Christopher and Nevis  which has joined the United Nations family as the 158th Member State. We should like to assure it of our friendship and cooperation.179.	There is no need to recall that the work of this session of the General Assembly is commencing in an international atmosphere characterized by the continuation of wide-ranging crises and the exacerbation of tension and contradictions in international relations.180.	The world in general  and the United Nations in particular  are thus faced by a dual challenge: the challenge to law and to the values of humanism  and hence a challenge to the primary mission of the United Nations; and the challenge to co-operation conceived as a rational and equitable organization of the interdependence of States  and to international solidarity. The first compounds the second and the second explains the first  although in no way justifying it.181.	Peace and security in the world  the Fine non for progress and development  indeed for the survival of civilization and the restoration of confidence in international relations  can be secured only if we are prepared to pay the price to meet that double challenge  and first of all  the challenge to law and to the values of humanism.182.	There is a challenge to law and to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations in the case of Chad  in Namibia  in South Africa  in the Western Sahara  in the Middle East  in Afghanistan  in Kampuchea  in the case of the destruction of a Boeing of the South Korean civilian air transport company and so forth. There are many sources of tension that draw the concern of world opinion and rightly provoke all sorts of questions concerning the future of mankind  at a time when we are less than 20 years from the end of the twentieth century. 183.	In Central Africa  and more particularly in Chad  we witness the dramatic calling into question of the principles of international law  principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the charter of the Organization of African Unity  particularly with respect to sovereignty  political independence  territorial integrity  non-interference in the domestic affairs of States  non-use of force in relations between States and the peaceful settlement of disputes.184.	That situation constitutes a serious threat to peace  stability and security in central Africa but  above all  it is a threat to the maintenance of the necessary balance throughout the African continent.185.	The present problem in Chad is neither more nor less than a challenge to law  to the Charter of the United Nations and to that of the OAU  because even recourse to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations by a legitimate Government which is the victim of blatant outside aggression has been criticized by certain States Members of the United Nations  illogically  since any of them could be attacked tomorrow by an outside force.186.	I say illogically because at present States other than Chad are also partially occupied by armed forces supported and equipped from outside  inspired by a determination  which they in no way conceal  to overthrow the established governments. If we are unanimous in recognizing that such de facto occupations are illegal and constitute threats to peace and security  why should anything be different in the case of Chad?187.	We noted with satisfaction the recent statement by Mr. Hissein Habre  President of the Republic of Chad  in which  on behalf of the State and people of Chad  he made a moving appeal to all the nations of the world to help Chad preserve its territorial integrity  sovereignty and national unity. The head of State of Chad furthermore said he was fully ready to establish the conditions to enable Chad  with the assistance of all its sons  to set about the restoration of peace and reconciliation so as to ensure the development of the country.188.	We  in turn  appeal to all the sons of Chad and address our encouragement to the OAU in order that no honest effort be spared to find a peaceful solution to the drama of Chad  taking into account the rights of that country.189.	Speaking of the withdrawal of foreign troops  I take this opportunity to note that Zaire dispatched its troops to Chad at the request of the legitimate Government recognized by the United Nations  because uninvited forces had intervened there illegally  thereby threatening its security  territorial integrity and sovereignty. If those forces were to leave  the troops from Zaire would not remain in Chad one day longer.190.	Since the adoption in 1966 of General Assembly resolution 2145 (XXI)  which put an end to South African administration in Namibia and placed that Territory under the jurisdiction of the United Nations  defiance of the rights of that African Territory continues with quasi- impunity.191.	The United Nations plan for a negotiated settlement of the Namibian question  accepted by the whole international community  has been particularly difficult to apply  especially by those who initiated it and whose influence over the South African regime is  as everybody is aware  enormous.192.	However  Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is fully consistent with the spirit and letter of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.193.	In May 1983  on the initiative of the group of non- aligned countries  the Security Council  after debating the question of Namibia  adopted resolution 532 (1983)  inviting the Secretary-General to undertake further efforts with the parties concerned to guarantee speedy implementation of Council resolution 435 (1978).194.	However  it does not seem that the response of South Africa to the recent approach by the Secretary- General  who went to that country  is likely to accelerate the accession of Namibia to independence.195.	We should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the sole basis for negotiations for the peaceful settlement of the Namibian problem. For the five members of the contact group which initiated the United Nations plan to resolve the Namibian problem  there is a question of credibility. They must implement the plan and not set aside its objectives.196.	Africa intends to keep out of power rivalries  and it is for that reason that it asks that the Namibian problem be seen as a problem of decolonization and that all the parties abstain from introducing into the Namibian question extraneous elements which could distort the problem and present it in Manichean terms as part of the East- West conflict.197.	We hail the heroic struggle being waged by the Namibian people under the leadership of SWAPO  and we appeal to all nations of the world to contribute to the rapid implementation of the United Nations Plan for the settlement of the Namibian question and to lend their support and assistance to SWAPO  the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people.198.	We reiterate our condemnation of the repeated acts of aggression carried out from Namibian territory by South Africa against neighbouring African States  and in particular the violations of the territorial integrity of our sister republic of Angola  which have resulted in enormous damage to the economy of that developing country.199.	South Africa's continuing illegal occupation of Namibia  coupled with its denial of the rights of the Namibian people and use of Namibian territory as a base for attacks against neighbouring countries  constitutes a serious threat to peace and security in that sensitive region of southern Africa.200.	In South Africa itself  the perpetuation of the policy of	condemned by the international community as a crime against humanity  is repugnant to the conscience of all right-thinking people  to all men devoted to peace and justice throughout the world. Although apartheid has been unanimously condemned as a crime against humanity  there are some who refuse to draw the logical conclusions of that condemnation both with regard to their own attitudes towards the Pretoria regime and with regard to the actions of that regime and the legitimate struggle for national liberation being waged by movements recognized by the United Nations.201.	What the Africans are demanding is the emergence in South Africa of a truly democratic multiracial society governed by the majority and respecting the rights of all minorities. In an era when the defense of human rights is on the agenda of international gatherings as well as bilateral meetings  particularly between the countries of the North and those of the South  how can we explain the silence of one side in the face of the most serious violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of all time  namely  apartheid 202.	It is dear that a State is entitled to organize the repression of crimes  offenses and other breaches in the law in order to protect law and order and the common weal. apartheid  which is a crime  is at the core of national life as organized by the Pretoria regime  and it forms the basic notion upon which the constitution and all official activities of that country are based. Therefore  apartheid is a crime unpunishable in South Africa  and South Africa is not a State based upon and governed by law  since its constitution must be regarded as being the instrument par excellence of a crime against humanity. Is there a Nuremburg Tribunal or a Tokyo Tribunal to punish this crime  which is unpunishable in South Africa  as there were for the crimes of nazism that were unpunishable in Hitler's Germany? If we are unwilling to punish the crime of apartheid what are we to do  since the idea of with a human face is incorrect  as apartheid has been defined as a crime against humanity? These are questions that demonstrate once again that any approach employing double standards is not calculated to strengthen trust in international relations and undermines the credit of those nations the adopt a compliant attitude towards apartheid.203.	What meaning can we give to this contempt for law on the part of States based upon and governed by law that do not hesitate to preach humanism and democracyâindeed  respect for human rightsâto the States of the third world? Does it reveal the predominance of a unilateral and therefore totalitarian  monopolist and monopolizing approach to human rights  or does it reveal a deliberate indifference to the humiliation of and denial of basic human rights to the black man of Africa or to the so-called coloured of the third world?204.	South Africa's timid approach to this issue  which takes the form of granting some rights to certain mixed or Indian communities or by granting limited trade-union rights to the black mine workers  must be replaced by a clear policy aimed at restoring to the blacks all their rights in the interest of peace in South Africa and of trust and co-operation among all nations and races throughout the world.205.	As it did with other regional organizations  the United Nations  in keeping with Article 52 of the Charter  recognized the competence of the OAU with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security in Africa. On many occasions we have noted that  when either the Security Council or the General Assembly is faced with an important African political problem involving peace and security  it does not hesitate to refer it to the OAU. This happened in the case of Western Sahara. Yet at the same time certain Member States are attempting to impede the actions of OAU by adopting positions contrary to law and to unanimous OAU resolutions.206.	Just and lasting solutions to the problem of Western Sahara can be found only through respect for the decisions adopted at the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  as reaffirmed at the nineteenth session held at Addis Ababa last June  namely  by organizing a referendum for self-determination in Western Sahara and through the implementation of the measures drawn up by the Implementation Committee of the OAU. If we wish to achieve real progress on the basis of those measures it is essential that they be scrupulously implemented by the OAU.207.	We therefore appeal to all nations of the world to support the efforts of the OAU in this area. We have noted with satisfaction recent developments in the Arab Maghreb  and we hope that the political thaw and detente emerging there can contribute to the restoration of peace in that important region of our continent.208.	In the Middle East there is obviously a problem of peace. Peace is indeed the crucial element in a region that has known no peace since 1947.209.	The recent International Conference on the Question of Palestine  at Geneva  in addition to seeking to create a better awareness of the underlying causes of the Palestinian problemâthe underlying causes of one of the oldest and most serious hotbeds of tension and warâ and to finding ways of enabling the Palestinian people  through a comprehensive international effort  to exercise their legitimate rights  also embodied the will of the international community to achieve peace and called for a comprehensive international effort to enable the protagonists to overcome the psychological  historical  legal and other obstacles to the exercise of the rights of the Palestinians.210.	Peace presupposes  first justice and equity  because the Arab people of Palestine  like the people of Israel  are entitled to a homeland  to a State. The General Assembly understood this at an early date when  on 29 November 1947  :t set forth the principle of a Jewish State and a Palestinian Arab State by adopting resolution 181 (II) containing the Plan of Partition for Palestine.211.	Secondly  peace presupposes respect for law  namely  for the principles of international law concerning friendly relations and co-operation among States  or  in other words  of the recognized principles of peaceful coexistence. The Security Council understood this when it adopted resolution 242 (1967) on 22 November 1967  which set forth the conditions for the establishment of a just and lasting peace and the principles for a comprehensive peaceful settlement of the Middle East crisis.212.	Peace presupposes  thirdly  recognition of the rights of the Palestinians  because it is the breach of those rights that lies at the very heart and origin of the Middle East conflict. The General Assembly recognized this  first in 1969 when  in resolution 2535 (XXIV)  it turned its attention towards the search for a comprehensive solution recognizing that the question of Palestine was at the heart of the Middle East conflict  and later  in 1974  in resolution 3236 (XXIX)  when it reaffirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.213.	Fourthly  peace presupposes the adoption by all parties of the spirit of dialogue and negotiation. This has been the view of the Security Council since 22 October 1973  when it adopted resolution 338 (1973)  deciding that negotiations between the parties concerned should start immediately.214.	Within the framework of a comprehensive international effort the United Nations has a vital role to play  based on its historic responsibilities. The United Nations gave a State to the Jews of the Diaspora and decided upon a Palestinian Arab State. It must now succeed in giving that State to the Palestinians.215.	The United Nations  whose work in establishing rules has become part of the heritage of international law  must ensure the triumph of law and justice in the Middle East. The United Nations  whose mission is to preserve present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war  must replace the spirit of war and confrontation with that of dialogue and co-operation. The United Nations  which is the catalyst of the aspirations of peoples to self- determination  must provide all necessary assistance in order to make the Palestinian entity a reality and to foster its economic and social development.216.	If the protagonists were able to solve this thorny problem by themselves we would hot be discussing it here. Each member of the international community must lend its assistance  in keeping with its own approach  resources and conscience  because this is a tragedy that contains the seeds of a serious threat to world peace. If such contributions are to be positive and useful  they must be supportive of efforts made in the spirit of peace  supportive of law  justice and equity  dialogue and co-operation. Then and only then will our debates mark a new and decisive stage in the painful history of Palestine since the end of the Mandate era.217.	Today it seems to us that all the ingredients for a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the crisis are present  for all the essential resolutions are mutually complementary.218.	General Assembly resolutions 181 (II)  194 (III) and 2535 (XXIV) and Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  to cite only those  taken together and linked to all the plans  agreements and peace initiatives put forward to date  offer  we feel  a consistent and integrated approach and contain all the elements of a just  comprehensive and lasting peace plan. On these bases the Security Council can  or could  either draw up a plan for the settlement of the Palestinian question or mandate the Secretary-General to attempt to formulate a proposal for consideration by the Security Council and by Member States.219.	Given the fact that since 1947 war has not provided a solution  we conclude that no strategy based on force can make it possible to resolve the thorny problem of the Middle East and Palestine  and that everybody should refrain from becoming involved.220.	What is the problem that arises  objectively speaking  in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  other than the right of all peoples freely to make their own choices and to live as they wish  free from pressure and acts of force  aware that their rights and liberties stop where the rights and freedom of other peoples begin?221.	It is without any doubt the violation of the principles of the sovereign equality of States  respect for the sovereignty  political independence and territorial integrity of States  non-interference non-use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputesâthe violation of the very principles of the Charter of the United Nations  of which we are all Membersâthat underlies these conflicts.222.	Hegemonist expansion and the desire of some people for political and cultural uniformity throughout the world  with all the disorder  clashes of interest and frustration that would provoke  are possible only through the violation of these principles. We say this to stress the vital importance of these principles and of law in relations between nations and peoples  because the purpose of these principles is precisely to prevent hegemonist expansionism and the desire for domination and political and cultural standardization of the world in the name of peace  international security  trusting co-operation among nations and peoples and the survival of universal civilized values. That is why these principles are impersonal  general and universal.223.	It was the spirit of lawlessness which developed in the world and led to the economic and financial crisis  which gave rise to the crisis of humanism  which we must light together in order to overcome the demons of insecurity  instability and mistrust in international relations.224.	Otherwise  let us have the courage  after the failure of the idealistic conception of history  to proclaim the failure of the rule of law and justice and yield the Held to the excesses of the forces of irrationality.225.	It is because we are all aware that in a world without law no one is safe from anything that we are so anxious to attempt to justify the frequent violations of law  in the name of narrow interests  thus giving rise to the phenomenon of the automatic rejection of anything coming from the other side  hostile propaganda  hysteria  disinformation  pressure of all kinds  the attempts to force weaker States to become clients and satellites.226.	Even the spirit of Yalta and the division of the world into spheres of influence which flowed from thatâ and only God knows whether we had a hand in that or opposed itâis no longer respected by those responsible for it  so that peoples are left to their own devices  prey to new dangers.227.	That is why in Zaire we believe that a just and lasting settlement of the Afghanistan crisis and the crisis of Kampuchea necessarily entails the withdrawal of all foreign troops from those territories  which they entered in disregard of law and the principles of the United Nations.228.	Without wishing to associate itself with any campaign or political propaganda gratuitously hostile to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  but in all objectivity and quite calmly  the Executive Council of the Republic of Zaire was outraged at the attack which occurred on 1 September 1983 over Sakhalin Island on a South Korean civil airliner  with hundreds of innocent victims  in defiance of the rules of international law and morality.229.	Over and above the massacre of 269 innocent civilian passengers  the gravity of this act  repugnant as it is to our consciences  lies in the fact that if such a precedent  which no appeal to national interest can justify  were to become more general  this would be a deadly blow to international relations and trustful cooperation among States.230.	This act  which occurred in a tense international context  dominated by the resurgence of mistrust  violence and insecurity in relations among States  must be condemned unambiguously by all right-thinking people in the world and by all Governments that cherish peace  if we are to have any confidence in the future.231.	The fact that this act was committed by a superpower which bears international responsibilities for peace in the world and which is a permanent member of the Security Council is something we find particularly troubling.232.	Here again it can be seen that it is respect for law and humanistic values which has dictated our stand regarding a country with which we maintain excellent diplomatic relations  and we hope that the USSR will make amends for this act and preserve its prestige in the world.233.	Latin America  which has so many affinities with Africa  needs peace and security in order to develop autonomously. We are in full solidarity with the peoples of that region in their desire for peace and to safeguard their own identity in order to create the conditions necessary for growth and bring to the building of a more just and equitable new world order the fruit of their genius. Here again  peace can only be achieved for us all through respect for the principles of international law and of the United Nations.234.	As if all the sufferings of humanity at the present time were not enough  the senseless arms race  particularly the nuclear arms raceâa true threat to life of apocalyptic dimensionsâadds every day to our distress  indeed our anguish.235.	While the alarming decline in the quality of life is becoming more perceptible from day to day in vast regions of the world  the race in engines of death is accelerating and swallowing up  as frequently repeated  more than $800 billion a year. Of course  the stench of the corpses of the victims of hunger  malnutrition and endemic disease is overpowered by the sulphurous fumes of gunfire.236.	It would seem that we have already forgotten the Programme of Action and the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament.237.	The sound of the feet of the thousands of citizens of the world who invaded the United Nations Headquarters during the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to protest the arms race  the appeals of scientists  philosophers  public figures throughout the world  people from the world of art  letters  religion  economics and politics  the entreaties of those crippled in Hiroshima and Nagasaki  underlining the senseless nature of the arms race  seem already to have been consigned to oblivion or to the indifference of those whose power today is measured by the number of their guns  missiles and nuclear warheads.238.	Yet all of us belong to a civilization which teaches us that man is superior to the animal by virtue of his spirit and that true immortality is innate in thought.239.	Yet a consensus had already emerged among all the nations of the world at the end of the tenth special session that the arms race is the centre of the present world crisis  when we perceive it  as we should  from the standpoint of peace  security  development and the measures necessary to establish confidence in international relations.240.	It is for this reason that the General Assembly has called for special studies on the relationship between disarmament and security  disarmament and development  and disarmament and confidence-building measures to make everyone more aware of the many dangers inherent in the arms race and to create the necessary conditions for halting and reversing this race to death.241.	Our common concern to educate man in the spirit of peace and to include peace studies in national programmes has led us to agree to the establishment of a University for Peace in one of our Member States.242.	Now  what is happening today? Have the great Powers forgotten that  in terms of peace  security  progress and development  the arms race is at the centre of the present crisis in the world and is jeopardizing civilization's essential values? Could it be that this race is designed to challenge the values upon which the United Nations is based  values from which certain great Powers seem to wish to depart ever further?243.	The arms race constitutes a powerful lever of the policy of the resort to force in international relations  the policy of intimidation  subjugation  hegemony and expansionism. More weapons no longer provide more security. Since the end of the last world war  how often has a great Power used its sophisticated weapons against another? But then the question arises: against whom are these weapons being manufactured?244.	The arms race widens the gap between the developing and the industrialized countries. It wrecks the efforts to establish the new international economic order  which the industrialized countries are so reluctant to join.245.	Without overlooking the danger of conventional weapons  weapons that have indiscriminate and excessively harmful effectsâbacteriological or toxic weapons  chemical weapons which we see being increasingly used in the third world countries  where proxy wars are going onâZaire wishes to reaffirm its attachment to the philosophy of the Final Document of the Tenth SpecialSession of the General Assembly  which gives high priority to nuclear disarmament.246.	We express again our determination to see the nuclear-weapon States give explicit and solemn guarantees to the non-nuclear-weapon States  or States that have renounced the acquisition of nuclear weapons  that they will never use them or threaten to use them against such States.247.	The ease with which weapons are circulating in the world today  either because of the profit motiveâwithout any considerations being given to the use to be made of them  even if that use is known in advanceâor to serve the designs of power and illegal causes  must be a subject of concern to the United Nations and the international community.248.	We very much hope that the negotiations on the reduction of strategic arms will prove successful as soon as possible. Zaire also appeals to the conscience of all those concerned; we ask them to respect the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons   particularly in regard to zones of peace and co-operation and nuclear-weapon-free zones throughout the world.249.	Confronted by all the political problems and problems affecting the maintenance of international peace and security to which I have just referred  we have the duty to meet the challenge to law  to eradicate the flouting of law in international relations. And ""law"" here means the ensemble of positive rules and norms governing relations between States  but also the ensemble of acknowledged rules of conduct which entail only moral obligations in relations between men and peoples. For the erosion of the essential values of civilization and of humanistic values benefits the various conflicts confronting us. The present crisis in the world is a political crisis  because the rules upon which the human city is based are sustaining severe blows today. And if they are finally swept away  what alternative do we have to offer our children?250.	Man is a reasonable being and is innately motivated to enter into society with his peers. This need to live in a society satisfies  above all  a moral feeling for the welfare of others; it responds to the desire for a condition in which we can at one and the same time find our own satisfaction and ensure that of others.251.	I therefore share the opinion of the Secretary- General that we are now witnessing the collapse of a number of agreements concluded over the years as the result of arduous and lengthy negotiations and that it is vital to reverse this trend  not only in order to confront immediate conflicts but also in order to build a lasting framework of life for future generations.252.	We in Africa can live very comfortably with the principles of international law and of the United Nations. The third world  which is forging the instruments to master its destiny and its future  needs these principles. The small  medium-sized and weak States  which are the majority in this Organization  and which do not produce weapons or have the means to buy them  shelter their sovereignty  their independence  their integrity  their own identity behind these principles of international law  because they know that in a world without law it is essentially they  not the powerful and the rich  who will be the losers. Has Europe turned its back on the rays of light coming from ancient Greece and its own gods?253.	No subject other than that of the arms race could have served as a better introduction to the second challenge of today's world: co-operation and solidarity.254.	We have repeatedly said that the present economic system is unfair and that  if we are not to wreck our world  we must replace it by a new economic order that is more just and better adapted to the new requirements of the times. Facts confirm this every day. Our protagonists in the Northâalso facing this crisis  which is the reflection of a profound disarray in structuresâhave not succeeded in proving the contrary. But they seem to wish to resistânot all of them  happilyâchange and the establishment of the new international economic order.255.	Certainly  the United Nations has undertaken considerable efforts to this end. Thus  the relevant resolutions adopted at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assemblyâcontaining the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and concerning development and international economic co-operation âas well as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States fully justify the international community's desire to face up to the present crisis in the world together and responsibly. Democratization of international economic relations is an imperative of our time.256.	Zaire continues to believe that the crisis now afflicting the world results primarily from the policies pursued by the industrialized countries  despite what is often proclaimed by those who have an interest in ensuring that we create no industries of any kind  no steel plants  no airports  no large-scale transport infrastructures. This crisis is the result of basic inadequacies of a world economic system that no longer responds to the requirements of a world in constant evolution  and of the structural gaps and the imbalance in interdependent spheres of which we are all awareâthat is  commodities  trade  development  energy  currency and finance.257.	The developing countries have been the most severely shaken by the effects of this crisis because of the decline in international trade caused by inflationary pressures imported from the developed countries and the resurgence of protectionism in those countries; a sharp decline in commodity prices  the principal source of export earningsâa $20 billion-net loss in export earnings for the year 1981-1982; an appreciable reduction in development aid  increasingly weighed down by unacceptable political conditions; a sizeable decline in the inflow of international capital to the developing countries; a disturbing increase in the indebtedness of the developing countries  which in 1982 reached the sum of $630 billion for the whole of the third world; and  finally  the tendency on the part of financial circles and international financial institutions to harden their positions and concern themselves more with the establishment of harsh programmes of economic and financial adjustment in the countries with the greatest indebtedness  without any regard to the social obligations of our States. The international financial institutions are becoming agencies for the recovery of the public and private debts of the States of the third world.258.	The economic crisis which has now gone on for almost a decade has attained such a scope that sectoral or partial solutions will not work.259.	Thus  the new international economic order that we seek implies a radical break with the laws and principles that have regulated the economic world since the end of the Second World War. The solutions to this crisis must be global and laid down in a spirit of complementarity and interdependence  for the greatest good of all.260.	This economic crisis  in the face of the unaccommodating attitudes we have noted  calls for our commitment to solidarity and interdependence and our ability to adapt to change.261.	It calls  first of all  for solidarity. We have in many of our statements in the past stressed this aspect of the problem. Solving the world crisis requires the commitment of all. It is not a question of winning at the expense of anyone else; we shall win together or we shall lose together. We have to share equitably in world prosperity. We must be sensitive to the suffering and misfortunes of others and give each people  each nation and each region of the world the opportunity to take part in the recovery of the world economic situation. If we agree that it is only the North that can put the world economy back on its feet  must we also agree that the salvation of the world will come from the North?262.	Interdependence  in our view  is based on mutual interest. In spite of the acceptance of the principle of the interdependence of the States of the North and South  we note with regret that the developed countries  since the fifth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  at Manila in 1979  have shown a marked hardening of their positions and turned their backs on any constructive and mutually advantageous dialogue. The deplorable results of the sixth session stem from this negative attitude of the rich countries.263.	We are told of the economic recovery taking place in the Northern countries  which is going to increase the volume of world trade by about 4.5 per cent. For our part there can be no doubt that the success of the North and its recovery can be sustained only with an extra effort to help the countries of the South. It therefore depends largely on consistent efforts to help the developing countries. Much is said about the magic of market laws  and we are asked to contribute to the expansion of world trade  to produce more and to export more. We are told that we should have fewer loans and more trade and commerce. With what are we going to produce if capital and development aid are so parsimoniously doled out to us? Why export unless commodity prices are stabilized? These are questions which militate in favour of a coherent  integrated and global approach in the search for appropriate joint solutions to the present crisis.264.	We in Zaire do not see interdependence as the subjugation of some to the interests of others but rather as an awareness of the fact that the fate of the North is intimately connected with that of the South. The present prosperity of the North is certainly due to the labours of its own people but everyone knows it is also in many respects due to the labours of the people of the South.265.	I turn now to adaptation to change  for the world is in a state of constant evolution.266.	Adaptation to change means for the North its capacity to understand that the maintenance or improvement of the development of its economies necessarily entails the abandonment of certain privileges born of the Bretton Woods system  which no longer exists except in name. If they fail to understand this truth and seek refuge in delaying tactics  the rich countries will only be maintaining ambiguity and creating a desperate situation with no way outâat least  no satisfactory way out for us all.267.	As for the South  adaptation to change means its capacity fully to assume its new role as an equal partner of the North in the search for and the taking of decisions concerning world matters. In the view of Zaire  this harmonious understanding constitutes the essence of international co-operation  for without real co-operation we should be calling in question the very principles of sovereignty and interdependence. We must therefore revise the tendency towards the erosion of multilateral co-operation and curb the excesses of politically inspired bilateralism. 268.	It was to face all these problems responsibly that the North-South dialogue was started and the new international economic order was conceived.269.	Today  we must note with regret that very little progress has been made in the face of the obduracy and  sometimes  the selfishness of the rich countries.270.	The virtual indifference of the Summit of Industrialized Countries at Williamsburg with regard to the concerns of the developing countries  the recent failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  at Belgrade  and the scanty results achieved by the mini-summit organized by Mrs. Indira Gandhi  the Prime Minister of India and chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countriesâ to whom we should like to pay tribute for her initiativeâ do not give any grounds to hope for a reversal of these trends in the near future.271.	We must therefore continue to show imagination and alter this state of affairs because  as we were quite rightly reminded by the Secretary-General:""Unresolved economic conflicts can be  and usuallyare  a breeding ground for dangerous political tensions.""A major economic imperative of our times is theaccelerated development of the developing countries.""272.	The Organization must always embark upon its debate on the question of divided countries with the utmost circumspection and responsibility so as to highlight common ground and seek ways and means which could bring the parties to the negotiating table in an atmosphere of trust. Acrimonious debates and maximalist positions which strengthen the division of peoples are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.273.	We have in mind particularly the questions of Korea and Cyprus.274.	The reunification of the two Koreas  desired by all the Korean people  must be brought about on the basis of the patient and determined continuation of the negotiations begun in 1972 between the North and the South. For our part  we do not reject any peaceful initiative in keeping with the Charter which could help to bring this about. In this context we have noted with satisfaction certain suggestions put forward in this general debate  particularly by the representative of Luxembourg meeting. We must avoid the crystallization of opposing positions. We must think about this and show collective imagination.275.	Similarly  if we are to bring about a lasting solution of the question of Cyprus  acceptable to all parties  it must be tackled in a comprehensive and impartial manner  because we must guarantee to the two communities the same right to existence. In this context Zaire favours a continuation of the inter-communal talks on an equitable settlement under the auspices of the Secretary-General. The auspices of the Secretary-General means  going beyond mere form  that those talks must be aimed at objectives and must be conducted in conformity with the principles of the Charter. Here again  as can be seen  if sides have to be taken the only side we can take is that of law.276.	I cannot pass over in silence the painful problem of some 13 million refugees in the world who are living in extremely precarious conditions and for whom the future is most uncertain. Most of these refugees are in Africa and Asia  that is in developing countries which are in the most dire straits in view of their poverty.277.	While appreciating the considerable humanitarian work of the United Nations in this field  we believe that all Governments in the world  particularly those of the rich countries  and also the charitable agencies  must redouble their efforts by devoting particular attention to the elimination of the political causes underlying this phenomenon. These refugees  victims of racism and discrimination  intolerance  poverty because of economic conditions  apartheid and  political conflict  today weigh heavily on the conscience of the world.278.	The organization of a second international conference on African refugees should  we believe  command the attention of the international community.279.	After having reviewed the disconcerting picture of the present world economic  political and social situation  I cannot conclude my statement without saying something about the role of the United Nations in international relations.280.	At a time when the concepts  notions and ideas which have hitherto governed the life and relations of societies seem to be increasingly challenged  the United Nations stands as the last outpost of great humanistic principles and civilized values against the assaults of intemperance and the claims of the irrational which are born of the present world crisis. For Zaire  the United Nations remains an irreplaceable instrument in the search for and the safeguarding of peace  the centre for peaceful coexistence  a guarantee and a bulwark of the weak against the powerful and of the poor against the rich  the ideal place for dialogue among national differences in the search for a true policy of international co-operation where each can find some advantage and each  with due respect for his right to be different  can contribute to the search for equitable solutions to the many problems facing the international community.281.	The United Nations has existed for 38 years now. If its record is not one of unqualified success  let us give it credit for giving rise to  if not supporting  the positive changes in the world and sustaining all just causes. The failure of the United Nations flows essentially from the inconsistency of States  certain shortcomings in its functioning and a certain lack of adaptability of its machinery to world development. Its principles remain valid and its primary mission remains as noble as ever. Machinery in the service of those principles and that mission can and must be adapted to the lightning speed of the evolution of the world over the last thirty years. The report of the Secretary-General to the thirty-seventh session identifies very clearly all aspects of the problem and thus makes it unnecessary for me to dwell on them.282.	Zaire will always support the multilateral approach and the purposes and principles of the Charter. Despite our difficulties  our limitations and our modest means  we shall always resist fragmentation and the erosion of an international instrument which has all the necessary tools and resources to bring peace  security  stability  progress and justice to humanity.283.	Let us therefore make the United Nations the instrument capable  as it was 38 years ago  of preserving present and future generations from the scourge of war and the indescribable sufferings which would result there from and the appropriate framework for defining a new world order.284.	To the extent that we strengthen the role of the United Nations and translate its decisions into national realities within our States shall we come closer to the advent of a more reassuring world order.285.	This new world order involves a profound restructuring of the relations of production and distribution of wealth at the planetary level within the framework of international solidarity. 285. International solidarity will consist  for the developed countries and for the others  of their active participation in the historic task of establishing a more just and equitable world  transcending short-sighted national interests and compensating for any inequalities  in order to improve  on this earth on which mankind lives  the condition of all."
"30",1471,"COG",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 I extend to you  Sir  my delegation's very sincere congratulations on your outstanding election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. You succeed Mr. Imre Hollai  a distinguished representative of Hungary  who guided the work or the thirty-seventh session so effectively.2.	In you  Mr. President  we recognize not only an astute statesman and an accomplished diplomat whose career testifies to his commitment to the causes of the poorest and weakest countries  but also the representative of Panama  that country friendly with mine whose actions at the international level always provide evidence of a fervent dedication to the guiding principles of international relations  in particular those of self-determination  independence and territorial integrity. There can be no doubt that under your wise guidance the thirty-eighth session will be a milestone for the Organization.3.	I take this opportunity also to say how happy my delegation is about the admission of Saint Christopher and Nevis as the 158th Member of the United Nations and to express again to its delegation the readiness of the People's Republic of the Congo to promote mutually advantageous co-operation between our two countries and our peoples.4.	Throughout this session eminent heads of State or Government  responding to the wish expressed at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March  and by its Chairman  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  have spoken from this rostrum to draw the attention of the international community to the serious problems which are proliferating throughout the world. Many of those problems arise in Africa  and it is about them that I wish to express the concern of the People's Republic of the Congo.5.	Prominent among the frustrations which have dashed the hopes of the African peoples is the question of southern Africa. The solution of the problem of Namibia has been deliberately torpedoed by part of the Western contact group which has sided with South Africa by introducing into the negotiations with the South West Africa Peoples Organization and the front-line States conditions which are totally extraneous to the spirit and letter of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).6.	The right to independence of the Namibian people is not merely peremptory  considering the special responsibility assumed by the United Nations in respect of that colonial Territory  but also an indispensable element for promoting lasting peace in southern Africa.7.	Thus there are no grounds for the establishment of any link between the presence or absence of Cuban troops in Angola and the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations plan of action  or for any other false pre-conditions  such as the guarantee of the impartiality of this Organization  much less the guarantee of neutrality that the Republic of South Africa seeks to obtain from Namibia before the people of that country is allowed to exercise the full range of its inalienable rights.8.	Hence we are determined to continue to support any collective effort to resolve the situation in Namibia in order to secure the total withdrawal of South Africa from the whole of Namibia  including Walvis Bay  the Penguin Islands and all the other offshore islands  as well as the unconditional withdrawal of the Pretoria troops from Angolan territory  part of which they occupy with  apparently  the complicity of certain Powers.9.	It is the guaranteed impunity which enables racist South Africa blithely to pursue its criminal policy of  rationalization of apartheid . To the frenetic establishment of bantustans it now wishes to add a bogus constitutional reform which would divide the majority of the people by conferring on Indians and Coloureds a dubious representation which it denies to the majority black population.10.	We hope that no effort will be spared to put an end to this masquerade  which has lasted all too long and the price of which is paid every day by the front-line States  in particular  Angola  Lesotho  Mozambique  Zambia and Zimbabwe.11.	While the South African tragedy continues  defying all the principles of law and justice  another tragedy has arisen in the centre of Africa with the deterioration of the situation in Chad. There has been a lot of fuss and manoeuvring on this subject  giving the problem of Chad an international dimension and an ideological element for which the people of Chad have no use.12.	Last August  at Brazzaville  several heads of State and Government of central Africa  in the presence of Colonel Mengistu Haile-Mariam  the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity  set down in a statement which was distributed in the Security Council the basic principles for a solution to the tragedy of Chad. They proposed negotiations as basic action  recommending a cease-fire rather than the continuation of the fratricidal war  followed by the withdrawal of all foreign military forces from Chad  and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Chad.13.	As has been stated by President Denis Sassou-Nguesso  the Congo does not believe in a military solution to the problem or in the illusion that it is possible for one group alone to govern Chad. So far this has led only to a dangerous pendulum movement  arbitrarily favouring the periodic domination of one group by another  as the result  constantly called into question  of the use of arms. In our opinion  the only solution to this tragedy of the brother people of Chad lies in the reconciliation of the sons and daughters of that country in order to combine their efforts to bring about national reconstruction.14.	It is towards that end  and that end alone  that all efforts should be directed by those that claim to be thefriends of the people of Chad and guarantors of its security. For we believe the degree of concern for Chad is not measured by the amount of weapons and munitions supplied to that country for its self-destruction but by the quantity and quality of economic and human assistance granted  which is the only evidence of the respect and friendship felt for Chad and its proud and worthy people.15.	It is encouraging at this point to see already signs of the commitment of the Organization of African Unity tQ4U] to carry out its rightful task in respect of Chad with a view to restrict the tragic situation of that country and its people to its true dimensions.16.	Hence we can but support all efforts in that direction made by those who  at the international level  can truly contribute to the success of efforts to achieve the goal of national reconciliation  with strict respect for the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of its people.17.	Given the many affinities between the peoples of the Congo and Chad  my country expresses its willingness to participate in such action as far as it is able.18.	My delegation feels similar concern with regard to the situation in Western Sahara. Instead of providing excuses year after year for the worsening of the situation  the Moroccan Government should seek to create the best possible conditions for the organization of a fair and equitable referendum whereby the Saharan people could exercise their right to self-determination.19.	The OAU already has a committee whose mission is to monitor the implementation of OAU resolutions  in particular the one adopted at the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity.20.	Africans have a duty to ensure that this referendum is meaningful and to find an appropriate solution to this conflict which has recently threatened the very existence of the OAU. We also ask that the United Nations assist the OAU so as to ensure the full success of efforts to resolve the problem of Western Sahara.21.	As the years have passed  the crisis in the Middle East has reached its most critical state of tension. The absurdity of such a development is undoubtedly encouraged by two extremely negative factors. First  there is the refusal of Israel and those supporting it to recognize the Palestinian fact and to draw there from the necessary conclusions; secondly  there is the internal interference which  under the pretext of miracle solutions  merely further complicates the situation  which  s viewed only from the point of view of spheres of influence and so- called vital interests.22.	Among the adverse consequences of this state of affairs are the continuing occupation by Israel of territories that do not belong to it; the alteration of the human and material structure of what should be the Palestinian homeland; the disorganization of Lebanon  whose sovereignty and the integrity have been flouted; and  finally  the massacres  the genocide and the desolation.23.	Since the question of Palestine is the central element of the overall situation in the Middle East my country endorses the conclusions of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September  and especially the appeal for an international peace conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all the parties concernedâin particular the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  as well as of all the great Powers which have any influence at all in the affairs of the region.24.	In order to guarantee the integrity and authority of such a conference the United Nations should sponsor it through the Security Council  which has the necessary powers.25.	Is it not failure to use this pre-eminent instrument for promoting peace  which is the United Nations  that has led certain Powersâoverestimating their capacity as peacemakers and blithely confusing might and wisdom  selfish ambitions and the general interestâto become more like aggressors at the very time when they think they are serving peace?26.	In this regard our questions are the same as those asked by the Secretary-General  who again this year  in his report on the work of the Organization J[y4/?d/7]  has highlighted the dangers of the growing disaffection of some States for the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations to which they have all subscribed.27.	Further evidence of this danger is given by the threats inherent in the situation in Central America. It is clear that as long as social peace is not encouraged in most of the countries in the region by a speedy response to the most elementary aspirations of the peoples concerned  and as long as the tragedy of the exploited social classes is analysed in terms of the cold war or ideological influences  we are right to fear a worsening of the situation and an extension of the conflicts  which the demonstrations of military power one sees in the region will do nothing to help resolve.28.	The initiatives and efforts of the Contadora Group are clear evidence of the ability of the countries of the region to resolve their differences themselves through dialogue and negotiation. To us those efforts testify to faithfulness to the basic principles of international law concerning mutual respect  non-interference and the non- use of force.29.	The Congo hopes that those principles will prevail in settling the question of the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands  in ending the blockade of which Cuba is a victim and in removing the pressures being applied against Nicaragua  Grenada and Suriname. My country also hopes that the progress in the talks between Guyana and Venezuela  which has brought agreement on the procedure to be followed  will lead to a final solution to the border problem between those two countries.30.	I express similar wishes with regard to the situation in Asia  where we believe the main requirements for international peace and security are understanding between the great peoples of China and the Soviet Union and peaceful coexistence between the peoples of Indo-China and their neighbours.31.	By supporting the Secretary-General's efforts  the Soviet Union  China and other Powers can play an extremely positive role in creating a climate favourable to clearing up the misunderstandings in Afghanistan and those artificially sustained with regard to Kampuchea.32.	In our view  the international community has no choice but to assist all those peoples  which are linked by culture and history  to promote conditions favourable to the restoration of peace in this important region.33.	Only regional co-operation  particularly by those concerned  can reduce the constant danger of locking East and West in confrontation that is inherent in certain problems that are incorrectly viewed  such as the Korean question. For the peaceful settlement of this question  we see no alternative to the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Korean peninsula and the ending of manoeuvres intended to intimidate  in order to make possible a direct dialogue between the sons of the Korean homeland themselves. 34.	If there remains one field in which the most insidious dangers are accumulating unceasingly  it is that of international economic relations.35.	Because of the acute manifestations of the crisis afflicting us  the end of which is scarcely in sight  uncertainty about the future is becoming a basic element in the lives of hundreds of millions of men and women throughout the world. The disruptions in the world economy are severe  and the panic  tension and aggression they engender in people who are deprived and driven to despair are threatening.36.	My delegation gives a cautious welcome to the first indications  albeit uncertain  of economic recovery seen in certain advanced capitalist countries. However  in the field we see no real change of policy. On the contrary  we are continuing to experience a growth in well-known recessionary factors  particularly in the developing countries  as is borne out by the World Bank in its most recent reports.37.	The shocking selfishness of the rich countries remains the unshakable basis on which many developed countries believe they should perpetuate their own anachronistic views of the international economic order. This attitude was recently highlighted by the disappointing failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  at a time when there is hesitation with regard to the launching of global negotiations.38.	There is no need to give further proof of the pains that some developed countries are taking to resist any change intended to give our planet a little more solidarity.39.	In stressing in its conclusions the need to adjust and strengthen relations between North and South  the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries was only expressing the conviction of the developing countries in this respect. My delegation repeats this appeal  while requesting those developed countries that are tempted to abuse their positions of power to resolve to lift the outdated protectionist barriers which are paralyzing the sound development of trade and uncontrollably perpetuating bottlenecks that have the most adverse consequences.40.	It is certainly the clever transnational corporations that take advantage of this situation  just as it is the imperialist States that hasten to indulge all forms of economic aggression  blackmail and other coercive practices against the weakest countries in order to maintain and increase their profits.41.	But our countries will not rest until we see put into effect  in the name of equity and solidarity  the just proposals made in many national and international forums to establish improved structures and rules that can protect the fortunes of everyone in all circumstances.42.	The strategy formulated at New Delhi gave pride of place to the speedy convening of an international conference on monetary and financial matters  with universal participation  to examine the possibility of reforming the international system in these fields. Once again the ball is in the developed countries' court.43.	We intend to do everything in our power to see that there is  as an indispensable way to improve the present situation stronger and more extensive co-operation between the developing countries in order to reach the goal of collective self-reliance  without which the resources and energies of the third world will always experience a fate unworthy of the capabilities of the human genius.44.	The complexity of the problems and the meagre progress made in solving them appear clearly to have given rise to lethargy and alarming scepticism which sorely test the creative imagination of mankind and the effectiveness of the machinery for the settlement of conflicts and the easing of tensions.45.	Thus it is that in the sphere of disarmament the dialogue of the deaf engaged in by the nuclear superpowers has led to a genuine headlong rush reflected today in the allocation of more than $750 billion to weapons  to the disturbing popularization of a theory holding that a limited nuclear war is possible and  worse  to the frenzied militarization of outer space.46.	This absurd diversion of energy  determination and intelligence to irrational ends is often carried out  unfortunately  without the agreement of the peoples themselves  for inadequate mobilization holds them further and further away from the things which most basically concern their destiny.47.	But what is taken into account in the pursuit of these hasty policies are the selfish interests of the military- industrial oligarchies  which are ready to sacrifice even the happiness of mankind and the social progress of millions of human beings throughout the world to guarantee their positionsâtheir hollow positionsâof domination.48.	The present cold war is unique in that some have  with some justice  called it  the third world war . The generalized insecurity it has caused comprises both the  hot  wars which are scattered throughout the worldâ and especially in the third worldâwhich serve the ends of those who stir them up  and the state of poverty which marks the end of the twentieth centuryâparadoxically given the astonishing scientific feats of the age.49.	Justice and well-being remain basic needs  access to which should be denied to no country  no people  no race  and neither sex.50.	It is towards that end that efforts should be directed  and the shape of the international community's activities should be redefined by giving fresh impetus to the United Nations. I am convinced that there is no way to stave off the risks of the irrevocable other than by all of us together devoting our efforts to bringing about understanding among all the peoples of the world. To this end  the United Nations offers the machinery and the ways and means to fulfil this plan. Altogether  let us devote our generosity and our enthusiasm to bringing about the success of this noble cause.  51.	"
"31",1518,"COL",38,1983,"ï»¿1.		On behalf of Colombia  I would like first of all  Sir  to congratulate you most sincerely on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. It is a source of satisfaction to us that this honour has been conferred upon the Vice-President of a country with which Colombia has such brotherly relations. Your diplomatic skills and experience are a guarantee of the objectivity and effectiveness of the work of the Assembly.2.	I would also like to avail myself of this opportunity to welcome most cordially the delegation of Saint Christopher and Nevis  a country which  in accordance with the goal of universality  has just been admitted to membership in the United Nations.3.	It is easy to amuse oneself by putting together  like the pieces of a familiar jigsaw puzzle  the transformations which in recent times  through the magical power of commitments which changed collective behaviour  have swept away values once held to be immutable  among them the concept of sovereignty  on the basis of which each nation once withdrew into the isolation of its national borders as into a shell.4.	The conflict for power  even while it sacrifices consciences to opposing ideologies  characterizes every stage of the march of history. There is more profit in exploring its motives than in seeking to control it  in an age when those practising traditional diplomacy are displaced by incompatible factions determined to participate  whose precipitate pace is that set by the warning on the ancient Egyptian sundial: ""It is later than you think"".5.	Amidst the maelstrom of the Second World War and rising from its charred remains  the United Nations carved a place for itself in the preservation of the most urgently desired of all thingsâpeace.6.	Since then 38 years have passed and  despite our constituent Charter  the world is moving farther away from that ideal. An objective review of its acts of insanity reminds us that since that time there have been in succession 150 armed conflicts  waged in the name of the most senseless causes  each one reflecting an apparent yet absurd polarization.7.	But the victims have come from the low-lying lands of the weak  not from the centres of arrogant power  and the Mood has flowed in remote provinces  and not in the fortresses where the interests truly engaged in the conflict are to be found.8.	Can such a paradox be attributed to a disintegration heralding a conscious regrouping? Let us  inspired by our faith in the survival of mankind  assert that it is so  offering the testimony of a free country turned both to the Caribbean and to the Pacific  located at the point of junction between the Central American isthmus and South America  and close to the heart of disturbances which imperil the future of the world.9.	At one time we cultivated the illusion that  but for a few deviant exceptions such as the Malvinas Islands  colonialism came to an end with the Second World War  as nations emerged and claimed their right to produce and to market what they produced. But the cold war drove them into client bands which competed with one another for the unheard-of privilege of being able to set fair prices for their products and to have access to technology and finance. That competition  the weakness of the weak and their inability to work together kept down the prices of oil and basic commodities. The detente of the 1950s saw the emergence of the first blocs of developing countries  which came together to transcend the capitalist-socialist dilemma by establishing an independent existence. With the dispersion of the West the developing world forged its own path  and there followed the discovery of modernization  demonstrated by Japan  Germany  Korea and China.10.	The price of lack of understanding was exacted with interest and without advance notice. The world is simpler than it appears  and the new oil prices and the reforms in the world economic system  which had gradually to be accepted  marked the advent of a new order. That has been Colombia's goal in adopting a position of balanced impartiality and coexistence within the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  at present under the charismatic leadership of Mrs. Gandhi.11.	By what means are we to bring the two great world Powers  each a centripetal nucleus for friendly nations  to reopen the dialogue  to give more thought to mankind than to their own sometimes warped interests? Three great men who have left their imprint on this century strove to break that vicious circle: Nehru  heir to the legendary wisdom of the Hindus; Nasser  restorer of the spirit of Islam; and Tito  archetypal exponent of pragmatic nationalism. Their philosophy  with its concern to defend the cultural identity of peoples defined by Sukarno at Bandung  advocates the gradual and dignified attainment by mankind of a single world identity  in contrast to the bipolar Manichean divisiveness of the Yalta agreements. It puts faith in dialogue  in the opening up of channels through which peoples may develop autonomously and in peace instead of war among the powerful of the earth.12.	Satellite of nor and dependent on none  as well as the enemy of none.13.	This stance of Colombia's has been fundamental to our foreign policy since the foundations of our nationhood were laid  when the Liberator Bolivar called upon us to strive for a universal balance. Now  as we maintain those of our friendships that are based on respect  dignity  ideological plurality  democracy and rejection of colonialism  we believe that the time has come for the birth of the new world cultural order proclaimed by the African prophet of Negritude  Leopold Sedar Senghor  a spiritual adventure in which members are warmly invited to join us.14.	The time is now  because the polarization of the world into two menacing and mutually suspicious blocs is endangering peace with the appalling possibility of nuclear destruction.15.	The struggle for supremacy is the spur to acts of madness which shatter the measure of that which is rational and that which is not. The arms build-up is disproportion in its most tragic manifestation. It is always possible to assess the relative cost-benefit ratio of undertaking an act or leaving it undone  of expanding or diminishing its scope  of controlling or limiting itâsave in the case of the arms race  whose excesses attain such a pitch that in the minutes it takes me to utter these words the world will have spent $50 million on refining its techniques of destruction.16.	One of the simplest arguments on the side of peace states that war is not possible without weapons. There are those  like the Harvard University group  who believe that now that mankind has lost its nuclear innocence it will never be able to regain it  and that Promethean man remains bound to such weapons as to fire. He will never be able to free himself from his knowledge. But conflict springs not from weapons or the expansion of arsenals  but from political decisions. Peace is not achieved solely by the abolition of the arms race; it is necessary for us to disarm in spirit and in actionâamong other things  to deny any further confirmation to the theory that the models of hatred are monstrous offspring of the West which materialize in all their brutality in the South  and to avoid confirmation of the anguished thoughts of Nehru when in prison:""Evil often triumphed  but what was worse was to see how that which had seemed so just became degraded and deformed. Was human nature so essentially evil that repeated suffering and disaster would be necessary before it learnt to behave rationally and to raise mankind above the level of the greedy  violent and deceitful being that he now was? And  in the meantime  was any effort to change that nature in the present or the near future doomed to failure?""17.	I shall not succumb to the attractions of Utopia  but I could not be at peace with myself if I did not cry out for all of us to be at peace with one another. Never has man held within his grasp so much technology beneficial to his welfare; never has he been so far from applying it to that end.18.	Such advancement  which belongs as naturally to everyone as air or water  flows from accumulated Knowledge in the gathering of which human beings have played an active or a passive part. It follows that the fruits of that harvest should benefit all mankind. Yet millions  the majority of the peoples represented by the men and women assembled here today  are prisoners of their own ignorance.19.	Science should not be twisted into dogma or exclusion  for every scientific theory is biodegradable  and to make science into a cult rather than a culture is to exalt irrationality and obscurantism.20.	They should not be exalted in space  for instance  that being one of the great arenas in which to project the ideal of justice. The fascinating adventure of outer space should make us sensible of our interdependence and of the community  which must husband precious resources in order that the species to which all nations belong may survive. For as we ascend to gaze more closely into the face of God we become more truly equidistant from any given point on earth. Consequently  we should not permit space to be traversed by the artefacts of war  to the helpless consternation of those countries which are not affiliated to the club of the powerful because they lack the means or are held back by philosophic inhibitions.21.	Our common heritage encompasses our crops  our mines  our coasts  the riches of the seas  our forests and riversâin other words  our health  our education  our survival; that precious essential  peace. It is our very souls that are at stake.22.	Part of that heritage too is the intricate network of our communications  the sound and images which fill the privacy of our homes  affirming the right to information and enhancing the quality of our lives. To convert space into yet another dimension of w&=fare above the fragile and defenceless heads of the dragon-flies of the universe is a diabolical form of domination. Let us rather return to the appeal made by the great Austrian statesman Mr. Kreisky:""What were once the railway  road and canal networks are now the telecommunications  information  computer  education and training networks using the most modern technology. Peoples seeking to develop have an absolute right to access without delay to these networks. We are witnessing a revolution in the concept of human resources. And we must avoid what is known as 'electronic apartheid"" . . ."".23.	Like the other countries of the geostationary orbit region  Colombia is aware of that privileged position. Accordingly  we have no wish to become the exclusive users of a resource of priority importance to the regions where its effects are felt  which is essential to peace and development and in which exploitation for the purposes of destruction or of undermining the sovereignty of nations or ecumenical stability has no part.24.	Despite my scepticism about rhetorical exhortations concerning peace and the deterrence-based arms race  there is a place for creative thinking such as that offered by the Club of Rome in its draft forum humanum. It has never been easy to learn from the lessons of history. Just as we are generous to ourselves in praising our few virtues  so we are circumspect and sparing in speaking of our defects. Voluble and contrary by nature  we are more so under the intoxication of power than in the melancholy of defeatâone of the relative advantages of being on the side of the weak.25.	Helmut Schmidt  that citizen of the world  recently explored the stormy seas of the crisis and concluded that we in the least developed countries had fared worst in the recession. The new fair prices for oil were paid ""only in small part"" by the industrialized countries  the brunt being borne by our terms of trade  which were shattered beyond repair. This fact was recalled a few days ago by Jorge Illueca  the President of this Assembly  and also by Osvaldo Hurtado Larrea  the brilliant young President of Ecuador. Someone with a black sense of humour commented that we  the poor  had been left to cope with an air-conditioned poverty.26.	There can be no lasting balance founded solely on the destructive capability of the super-Powers  much less on a division into spheres in which those in the subordinate areas row like galley slaves towards the power centres. The East-West polarization and the vertical dichotomy between the rich of the North and the poor of the South has no part in a just concept of reality  and we refuse to resign ourselves to it like slaves to the treadmill.27.	We of the South hold to our commitment to Western values  the organic meaning of our militant striving for peace  a striving which is not diverted from its purpose to serve an ideology. Secretary of State George Shultz  a man of intellectual distinction  has suggested that the refinancing of the developing countries  their external trade deficits and the prices of their exports should attract greater concern than communist subversion or other traditional sources of anxiety. I would add blind protectionism to the list.28.	It is evident that the tempting option of protectionism  one of the most unjust forms of discrimination  poses an obstacle to the third world  whose debts amount to some $600 billion. The refinancing of these debts must be made a priority  as the only alternative to the insolvency of the debtors. At the same time it would have a dynamic catalytic effect on the creditors. In spite of lacking so much  the third world plays a decisive part in the productive machinery of the industrialized countries.29.	Someone has cast doubt on the way in which Edward Heath  former British Prime Minister  presents these bold facts when he says:""One in every 20 industrial jobs in the United States is dependent on exports to developing countries. Those countries furnish 25 per cent of manufactures  imported at prices 16 per cent lower than those of the industrialized counties. They are also the source of two thirds of the service-related earnings of the United States trade balance. And 60 per cent of the external debt of the non oil-exporting developing countries is owed to financial institutions in the United States  in which 300 000 jobs were cut last year as a result of the effects of the recession on peripheral areas.""30.	This mutual dependence proves the urgency of reactivating the world economy as a whole and of redistributing financial resources through the conversion of a part of such countries' debts into investment in the social area  which will be discussed at the Latin American economic conference to be held at Quito in January 1984.31.	My voice is the voice of the ordinary man or woman  the beneficiary or victim of wise or misguided policies. A few hours journey away from these Headquarters lies a seething continent cut off from means of communication  banished from the attention of the powerful and currently the epicentre of events which in one way or another make us all actors in its tragedy.32.	The problems of Central America and the Caribbean did not develop overnight as if until yesterday those areas had been filled with dancing and the joyful strains of prosperity. Since attaining independence the region has followed a painful progress towards forms of genuine democracy  a journey in which development has lagged behind in the shadow of colonialist arrogance. But in the souls of our peoples  in the newly opened eyes of our starving children  there is potential. It is simply that their creativity is interrupted by interference alien to their aspirations.33.	Central America is an example of structural problems which must be solved by its peoples  and by them alone  within the sovereign framework of their genuine aspirations and their institutions. This is the purpose of the actions of the Contadora Group  which seeks to meet a need in the process of bringing peace to the region. It takes as a basis the common objectives of Mexico  Venezuela  Panama and Colombia  together with the firm support of all Central American countries  in working for conditions of freedom in which each country may determine its own future.34.	Violence  tensions  incidents  underdevelopment and injustice are all symptoms of a crisis in which coexistence and self-determination have been forgotten and which sees the super-Powers shamelessly interfering in lands where peasants leave the sowing of seeds to take up unfamiliar weaponsâand to dig their own graves.35.	In the joint endeavour within what is known to the world as the Contadora philosophy  I and my fellow heads of State  working together with our foreign ministers and advisers  made our diagnosis and are calling for understanding and seeking to foster dialogue  agreements and compromise solutions. And we are engaged in knock- in g on the doors of the powerful in our quest for peace.36.	To that end  on 17 July I and the Presidents of Mexico  Panama and Venezuela signed the Cancun Declaration	in which we make positive suggestions and reaffirm our belief in the search for peace  democratic institutions  respect for human rights and social justice. We expressed our concern to other heads of State  whom I wish to thank for their support. For the encouragement received from Pope John Paul II and many members of the world community  I wish to express my gratitude. It is clear to the Contadora Group that its mission as a herald of peace in Central America is in line with the objectives of the United Nations  and  within the context of Security Council resolution 530 (1983)  we are assisting the Secretary-General in the task entrusted to him by providing reports on the peace-making process.37.	America  Asia and Africa are the scenes of similar conflicts. In all three continents unjustified outside intervention is endangering peace  fomenting hatred  enriching arms merchants and provoking violence. Notwithstanding the particular characteristics of each case  those conflicts have in common the factor of foreign intervention  whether as a root cause or as a concomitant element.38.	That is why the head of State of a small country like Colombia  which is not an economic  military or political power but which is certainly a moral one  which at home is endeavouring to achieve peace  development and change with equity  feels morally bound to declare that it is essential as a matter of urgency for foreign troops and military advisers to leave Nicaragua  El Salvador  Honduras  Lebanon  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Namibia  Mozambique  Angola and Chadâwherever they are blocking the self-determination of the peoples of the world.39.	It is my country's fervent hope that in Central America  in the Near and Middle East  in South-East Asia and in any part of the world where man is engaged in destroying man  dialogue may silence the voice of the guns and that the sowers of death may depart. The sowers of death are the volunteers or mercenary troops and the great private or State corporations which  in the arms- producing countries  work to refine their diabolical inventions and build their power on their destructive capability.40.	I who now have the honour to address the Assembly am the second of 22 children of a semi-literate Colombian peasant family. I am not a technocrat  to my regret  but a former university professor who has stared hunger in the face  slept on park benches and taken any kind of work to survive. I am  then  a child of underdevelopment and a survivor of that dread disease  economic retardation. I know from personal experience the joys and sorrows of that branch of the human tree  the most numerous  the most long-suffering and perhaps the wisest of all. It is from that wisdom that I have spoken to the Assembly  without Messianic gestures or any pretension save that of having been made President of my homeland through the free vote of my humble people. It is in their dear  forthright and candid language that have spoken to you today.41.	As I look back  seeking a way to touch the Assembly's understanding  I recall the chiaroscuro world of my youth. How many changes there have been in one generation While horizons were shrinking  life expectancy was expanding. Then we numbered 2 billion; now we are 4 billion; in the year 2000 we shall be 6 billion.42.	Then  as now  we lived amid the din of the hurricanes which the powerful nations unleashed upon the world. Today we have shaped this Organization  in which nations that before were deprived of a voice express their sovereign opinions freely on an equal footing with all others.43.	In spite of the omnipresent spectre of war and of the barbarism masquerading in the insidious disguise of terrorism  and in spite of the lunatic sway held by a reason of state which could dictate the shooting down of aircraft with the sacrifice of innocent lives  and generate a plainly absurd distinction between ""authoritarian"" friends and ""totalitarian"" enemies  as if in all cases there were Hot human lives at stakeâsomething very noble has emerged from the Assembly's deliberations: dialogue between adversaries  no longer just theoretical but practical  a dialogue between equals in the world community.44.	I hope that you will forgive this reiteration of my rural creed  but I believe in the triumph of freedom over fatality  I believe that revolt against injustice is the driving force of history  and I believe that justice among the peoples will prevail.45.	For the African visionary Albert T6vo6djr6  the poverty of the peoples is converted into riches by means of a solidarity pact which acts upon spirits as a spur to progress. A man of this century  Bertrand Russell  controversial and provocative  whose lucidity and intellectual honesty not even Ms most vehement opponents dared to doubt  uttered these frighteningly optimistic words:""Neither poverty nor madness are an inevitable part of man's heritage. I am convinced that intelligence  patience and persuasion will succeed in liberating the human species from its self-imposed torment  provided it does not first exterminate itself . . ."".46.	To paraphrase my compatriot  Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez  I urge members to work to give those sections of humanity condemned to 100 years of solitude a second chance on this earth.47.	Let us work together for a single race  the human race; a single language  that of peace; and a single purpose  progress. "
"32",1559,"COM",38,1983,"1.	I should like first of all  Sir  to offer you on behalf of my delegation our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that your long experience in the important posts that you have held  in particular as Permanent Representative to the United Nations and as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Panama  ensures the smooth functioning of our work as our Assembly once again tackles the serious problems threatening the equilibrium of our planet.2.	I wish also  Mr. President  to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  whose dedication and competence led to the smooth functioning of the work of the Assembly at the preceding session.3.	I should also like to pay a particular tribute to the Secretary-General for his constant efforts in the defence of the sacred principles of the Organization and to safeguard world peace.4.	My delegation is pleased to see in our midst Saint Christopher and Nevis as the 138th Member of the Organization. We offer our friendship to that country and wish it full success in its independence.5.	As in past years we are meeting here in this Assembly to carry out an exhaustive assessment of the political and economic situation in the world. Unfortunately  we must face the facts: far from improving  the international situation  both politically and economically  has only worsened. How can we come to any other conclusion when we see that at the present time there is no continent in which there are not one or more sources of tension. The sacred principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations have been flouted  and even at times deliberately violated. Force and domination have taken precedence over law and justice. Dialogue and co-operation have yielded to hatred and violence.6.	The tragic incident of the aircraft of the South Korean Air Lines which was shot down by a Soviet fighter  with the loss of more than 260 lives  is a vivid example of the serious consequences which can stem from the rivalry between the two super-Powers. It is obvious that whatever may be the cause and origin of the diversion of the aircraft from its itinerary  nothing can justify the destruction of the aircraft and the consequent loss of so many human lives.7.	A few weeks ago we observed the sad anniversary of the massacres in the Palestinian camps of Sabra and Shatila. The direct responsibility of Israel in this collective assassination has been demonstrated unequivocally by various inquiries in the field. Today we must acknowledge that the situation in the Middle East has hardly changed.Israel has refused to evacuate occupied Arab territories  notwithstanding the relevant resolutions of the Organization. Even more serious  Jewish settlements have increased in number in these territories  and this has been accompanied by a ferocious repression of the Arab- Palestinian populations  whose only fault is to want to continue to live on their own land. We realize that the Zionist entity would not have committed these acts had it not had the material and diplomatic support of its allies.8.	We shall never cease to repeat that there can be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East until the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are recognized  guaranteed and effectively exercised. Moreover  this is the spirit of the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva last August.' On the basis of this principle  it goes without saying that any negotiations aimed at settling the problem of the Middle East must necessarily involve the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. I should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm once again the unstinting support of my country for the Palestinian people in its tireless struggle to regain its dignity.9.	The situation today in Lebanon  formerly a land of peace  is more than alarming. We are greatly disturbed by the presence of the foreign forces which continue to occupy the country illegally  thus flouting its absolute right to exercise its sovereignty. It is high time that the Lebanese people  who wish only to live in peace and security  regained their dignity.10.	The recent cease-fire in Lebanon  thanks to the mediation of Saudi Arabia  whose efforts we salute  has given rise to certain hopes. That is why we support any initiative to reconcile the children of that country so that its legitimate Government can exercise its authority over the whole of the national territory. This obviously implies the cessation of the rivalry among foreign Governments in Lebanon.11.	The fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq continues to cause the loss of many human lives in both camps. In spite of efforts of the United Nations  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Gulf Co-operation Council to bring the two belligerents to the negotiating table  the war continues amid intransigence and hatred.12.	My country  which has already sent a mission of persuasion to Teheran and Baghdad  remains concerned about this situation  especially since this confrontation endangers two Moslem countries which are both members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement. We welcome the offers of a cease-fire which have frequently been made by the Iraqi Government  but which so far unfortunately have not met with a favourable response from the Iranian Government. We reiterate our appeal to these two countries to cease hostilities immediately in conformity with the sacred principles of solidarity and Islamic fraternity taught us by the Holy Koran.13.	In spite of the resistance of the Afghan people  whose courage we hail  Afghanistan continues to lose its life-blood. More than 3 million Afghans have perished in the war so far and others have gone into exile. There can be no doubt that this situation is a serious threat to the peace and security of the region. I wish to reaffirm the complete support of my country for the Afghan people. We call for the immediate withdrawal of the foreign forces from that country  in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.14.	Turning to Kampuchea  we note with great disappointment that the General Assembly resolutions calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from that country remain without effect. The people of Kampuchea  who have long suffered from the war  are entitled to peace and freedom. However  this will be possible only if they are allowed to choose for themselves  without any foreign interference  the system of government that most suits them.15.	The situation in the Korean peninsula remains at a standstill. In spite of the affirmation by the two States of the north and south that they wish to reach agreement  no decisive action has yet been taken for the peaceful reunification of the country. We appeal to both parties to persevere in the search for a just and lasting solution  since a united Korea will be a guarantee of peace and stability in that region.16.	The situation in southern Africa remains explosive and is of great concern to the international community. My country  which condemns the odious system of apartheidpracticed by the Pretoria regime  unreservedly supports the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative  the South West Africa People's Organization17.	We remain convinced that only the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which was the subject of an international consensus  can lead to a peaceful negotiated of that distressing problem. We welcome the recent initiatives of the Secretary- General  who went to several of the capitals concerned in order to make the necessary contacts to facilitate the settlement of the conflict. The contact group of five Western States must now make the necessary effort to complete the mission assigned to it by the Organization in spite of all the obstacles. The international community also must do its utmost to safeguard the existence of the front-line countriesâAngola  Mozambique  Zambia  Zimbabwe and Botswanaâso that they can pursue their development in peace and security.18.	The situation in Chad calls for special vigilance. That State  a founding member of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  has for more than 16 years suffered from a civil war that has brought untold suffering and loss of life. Today this conflict  as the result of interference by foreign forces  is reaching a stage of internationalization that may jeopardize the chances of national reconciliation.19.	We have welcomed the recent appeals by the N'Djamena authorities to all Chad citizens to make the necessary effort to set aside their quarrels  be reconciled  and achieve national harmony and peace. We urge them to follow the path of reconciliation  but we remain convinced that any solution of the conflict in Chad must be based on respect for the territorial integrity of that country and consequently on the withdrawal of all foreign troops.20.	Turning to Western Sahara  we welcome Morocco's commitment  given from this rostrum on 27 September by His Majesty King Hassan II  to accept the results of a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara. The holding of this referendum  which is in conformity with the decisions taken at the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Nairobi  would constitute a step towards the peaceful settlement of this problem.21.	My country  like all the other littoral countries of the Indian Ocean  is concerned over the increased military presence in that zone. This situation creates tension and accentuates the rivalry between the great Powers. We reiterate our desire that that region should become a true zone of peace in conformity with the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  contained in resolution 2832 (XXVI)  and we earnestly hope that the international conference scheduled to be held at Colombo will finally take place.22.	The gloomy picture of the international political situation I have just sketched out is unhappily reflected in the world economic situation  which is undergoing its worst crisis since the 1930s. The causes of this crisis are obviously inflation  the disorder in the international monetary system  with the resuming soaring interest rates  the restoration of certain protectionist practices in trade  the recession  the unequal development of nations  and many other factors.23.	This session is being held exactly three months after the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July last.24.	The discouraging results of that meeting are a reflection of the intransigence of certain developed countries which stubbornly concentrate only on the defence of their own interests. The recovery that has been so anxiously awaited has not yet occurred  which demonstrates the inadequacy of the various piecemeal efforts made to solve the structural problems of the world economy. In our humble opinion  only a global approach that covers all aspects of this complex situation  including the grave financial difficulties of the third world  is capable of ridding us of this scourge.25.	The countries of the third world have seen a steady decline in the prices of their raw materials; this reduces their export earnings  and thus the resources of the State at the very time when the debt burden has become intolerable.26.	This crisis which has afflicted the fragile economies of the least developed countries inexorably accentuates their underdevelopment and makes it even more difficult for them to gain access to the international financial markets  where there is an increasing tendency to lend only to the richer countries.27.	The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  like the other least developed countries  has been one of the main victims of the disorder in the international economic system. Being an island country newly independent and with limited resources  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros has had since 1977 a continuing decrease in the average growth of its purchasing power and a steady falling off in per capita foreign exchange earnings.28.	This situation seriously jeopardizes the efforts to bring about economic and social recovery of the Comorian Government  which is doing all it can to rescue our young country from the vicious circle of underdevelopment. Under the leadership of the President of the Republic  Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane  the Comorian Government has implemented a development policy whose objectives and priorities are based on the recommendations of the new programme of action  the Monrovia Strategy and the Plan of Action and Final Act of Lagos.29.	This development strategy has been set forth in our interim plan for 1983-1986 and in the national document prepared by my Government for submission to the next round-table meeting of donors at Moroni  our capital  to be held at the end of the first quarter of 1984.30.	The main aim of our Government for the next three years is to achieve a substantial increase in our growth rate. To that end a number of measures have been taken that are designed to restore public finances to a sound footing  restructure the productive structure and stimulate private and foreign investment through a loan allocation policy.31.	We are convinced that the Government's efforts to improve the situation  however praiseworthy and often with disturbing social consequences  cannot alone solve the structural problems which impede my country's economic development. That is why increased support from the international community is indispensable. Moreover  that is what is recommended in resolution 37/154 of 17 December 1982  entitled  Assistance to the Comoros . On the basis of that resolution  I should like to make an earnest appeal to the entire international community  to all donor institutions and organizations and to all the wealthier countries  to come to the assistance of the Comoros in its struggle against underdevelopment.32.	We are thoroughly convinced that the round-table meeting of donors in support of the Comoros  to which I have just referred  will be an opportunity for us to gather all good will in our country and for them to show us proof of their solidarity and support.33.	I should not like to conclude my statement without speaking briefly about a problem which is of major concern to the Government and people of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros. This is not just a Comorian problem  since it concerns in more than one way the African continent and the entire international community. I am referring  of course  to the problem of the Comorian island of Mayotte. We must return to this question because  as in past years  it has not been resolved  and it is on the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. It will therefore be the subject of a separate debate later.34.	For the present  I should like merely to reaffirm the Comorian Government's determination  shared by its people  to fight until their just cause triumphs. What is really at the heart of this question? It is nothing other than the flagrant violation of one of the sacred principles of the Charter of the United Nations  namely  the violation of the territorial integrity of my country  thus depriving it of its most legitimate right to exercise its sovereignty over a part of its national territory.35.	All States  regardless of their size  are equal before the law. Hence  we must not have a double standard in securing respect for the sacred principles of territorial integrity and national sovereignty.36.	As far as we are concerned  we are completely open to dialogue and to a meeting of the minds in an effort to bring about a just solution to this problem  in conformity with the recommendations of the relevant resolution of the Assembly.37.	It is therefore time for our voice to be heard. It is also time for our country  which has been insultingly referred to as  a three-legged cow  to get back its fourth leg  the island of Mayotte  and be given a chance to develop harmoniously and serenely to the benefit of all its inhabitants.38.	It is therefore in a very friendly spirit that we would appeal to the French Government to take the necessary steps that would lead to a settlement of this problem.39.	In conclusion  I should like to express a few thoughts which  even if they are already in the minds of some members  need to be stated over and over again.40.	In this troubled world where  if I may put it this way  the law of the jungle may soon be the rule of law  now is the time more than ever before to give to the Organization its proper role as arbiter and to comply with its judgments and resolutions without any false pride. That is in keeping with the noble mission we have entrusted to the Organization  that of safeguarding peace in the world. However  that will only be possible when each Member of the Organization scrupulously respects the sacred principles embodied in the Charter.41.	It is only if we act in that way that the world today will enjoy a calmer climate in which relations among nations will be based on mutual confidence and reciprocal interest  and no longer on distrust and discord  or even hatred and contempt."
"33",1599,"CPV",38,1983,"ï»¿  1.	 I am addressing this illustrious and sovereign General Assembly for the first time on behalf of the heads of State of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel. I do so keenly aware of the importance of the praiseworthy work taken on by all of you  the representatives of States of all continents.2.	If man now has everything that mankind has always dreamed of possessing in order to live in harmony with nature and to merge into a coherent and single whole  he nevertheless also possesses other means of unequalled power  which can reduce everything to ashes and annihilate thousands of years of civilization.3.	That is why so many hopes are placed each year in the General Assembly  which people expect to be a gathering of clear-minded people anxious to preserve the future of nations  united by the same determination to overcome all obstacles to the progress of mankind.4.	Millions of men and women expect of your resolutions and recommendations concrete acts which will help to transform the tears of the victims of colonialism  racism and apartheid into smiles of hope  to provide the comforts so long awaited in the refugee camps  to provide the encouragement indispensable for the freedom- fighters  or  to put it in the simplest terms  to provide bread for those who are hungry  and the will to live for those who see death as the best option.5.	I do not think one can live a carefree life when one knows that although world-wide agricultural production today could satisfy the food needs of the people of the Earth  hunger and malnutrition condemn the majority of the inhabitants of the planet to live in sub-human conditions.6.	The truth is that in the era of computers and space exploration  human society has still not proved able to satisfy the most elementary needs of a large majority of its members. Those people who live today in abundance and comfort are forgetting how precarious their situation can be  that sooner or later the consequences of poverty  which is rife in vast regions of the world  will affect them too.7.	World leaders live with their eyes focused on the year 2000  trying to fathom the enigmas of the next era. But at the same time there is a growing awareness of the risks involved in the fact that humanity has carried with it so many vestiges of the servitude of the past.8.	We live in insecurity and anguish  knowing that a critical limit to tensions has been reached and that every day sees a dramatic reduction in man's ability to control and restrain his own actions  which in. most cases are born of attitudes condemned by the conscience of mankind.9.	That is why the 30 million people in the Sahelâ whom I have the honour  but above all the responsibility  of representing in this forumâbase their hopes on overcoming the scourges that threaten their very existence  that is to say  drought and desertification  in the conviction that :t is possible to change the present system of relations between peoples and States and devote the vast energies and resources that man has at his disposal to action that would correct the present dangerous imbalance and increase material and social well-being.10.	We are convinced that there is now an urgent need  in order to preserve the hopes of peace among men and harmony among nations  which constitute the very essence of the Charter of the United Nations  to mobilize without delay all available resources and technologies to face with courage and a sense of responsibility the serious problems affecting mankind  which are a challenge to our consciences. This has been the motivation in discussions at previous sessions and testifies to a profound awareness of these problems within the Assembly. It seems to us  therefore  that we should pursue a thorough analysis of the various aspects of the situation and implement policies which will make it possible to carry out decisions already taken or to be taken.11.	I should like at this time to greet all representatives as the messengers of hope. The world in which we live needs your efforts to spare it further tragedies or even annihilation. We know today from the consensus within the Assembly that the future for which the United Nations is working cannot be based on hatred or injustice or the abdication of our individual and collective responsibilities.12.	It was undoubtedly this understanding that led to the choice of Mr. Jorge Illueca to direct this session. He is a man of dialogue and an expert in the problems of our day  and we have no doubt that he will succeed in conducting the session to a successful conclusion  following in the footsteps of Mr. Imre Hollai  whose human qualities  combined with those of a distinguished diplomat  made it possible for him to carry out so brilliantly the formidable task entrusted to him last year.13.	However  even though it is not in the character of the Sahelian to give way to pessimism  I must say that the present unfavourable factors and the known facts of the world situation give no grounds for much optimism for years to come.14.	We are therefore very pleased to have at the head of the Organization  as Secretary-General  a man who in a short space of time has given proof of his sense of responsibility and calm determination in the face of the innumerable challenges which have confronted him day by day since he took office. Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar's efforts to reduce international tension  enhance the credibility of the United Nations system and create conditions which will bring us closer to the fundamental objectives of the Charter encourage our belief that his actions will have positive results and strengthen our hope that  despite the present difficulties and the complexity of the problems besetting the international community  mankind will succeed in overcoming these problems and the world will recover from its sufferings.15.	We are also pleased by the admission of Saint Christopher and Nevis  which has expanded the United Nations family and strengthened our conviction that the struggle of peoples for self-determination and independence is part of the historical evolution of mankind and a legitimate and irrefutable right.16.	Drought and desertification are today among the principal causes of the evils afflicting large areas of our planet. More than one third of the arable land throughout the world is situated in regions of the globe affected by drought. As far as the African continent is concerned  the extent of arid and semi-arid zones is alarming  at present 44 per cent of the land area. Furthermore  low- fertility land in Africa covers 18 per cent of the total surface area. It has been calculated that every year 50 000 to 70 000 square kilometers of arable land are lost to the advancing desert  thus posing a direct threat to the survival of 14 per cent of the world's population  about 628 million people.17.	The United Nations Conference on Desertification  which was held at Nairobi from 29 August to 9 September 1977  produced a plan of action and concluded that  if man is one of the principal agents of desertification  today he possesses the technological means to combat it. In the course of that Conference  the Secretary-General declared that priority should be given to the most vulnerable countries and that internal efforts should be focused more on the population than on the land.18.	If we focus attention on the region which encompasses the members of CILSSâleaving aside for the moment the overall pictureâwe can see that without the shadow of a doubt this is the most affected zone. The geographical and human area known as the Sahel is at present experiencing difficult and worrying times  brought about by the terrible drought ravaging our countries and the desertification which is inexorably gaining ground despite all the efforts of the Governments and peoples of the region to check the degradation of the Sahel.19.	In the face of this situation  we believe it appropriate to set forth in the Assembly the concern of our countries and to give an account of the efforts we have made to eliminate or at least reduce the causes of this problem. Toughened by the bitterness of the struggle for survival  the Sahelian peoples have learnt to accept only the language of facts when what is at stake is food and the creation of the necessary conditions for a decent life.20.	Situated in the wide belt of the arid and semi-arid zones of the continent  the Sahel covers an area of approximately 146 million hectares. In countries concernedâChad  Mali  Mauritania  Niger  Senegal  Gambia  Upper Volta and Cape Verdeâ45 per cent to 66 per cent of their territories is made up of arid and desert zones.21.	A certain number of known factors have combined to bring about accelerated deforestation  an increase in the process of desertification  and hence an imbalance in the whole ecosystem of the region. For example  if the present rate of exploitation continues  it is calculated that Mauritania's forests will disappear in five to 10 years.22.	In Niger forestry resources will satisfy barely 45 per cent of the energy needs over the next 20 years  if consumption is not reduced. In Mali the situation is similar to that in Niger. In Cape Verde the problem is the same  or worse.23.	If nothing is done to modify the present trends  such as the reduction of the fertility of the soil  increasing desertification and other similar problemsâthe Sahel will move inexorably towards ecological catastrophe.24.	Since the sixteenth century the Sahelian region has suffered the consequences of more than 20 major droughts  but it was the droughts of the 1960s and 1970s which called mankind's attention to the suffering of the peoples living there. Really tragic circumstances were experienced throughout that period.25.	The great drought which devastated the Sahelian countries in 1972-1973 had tragic features. During those two years harvests shrank by one third on average  and between one third and two thirds of the cattle were lost. The population that survived shows the effects of the chronic malnutrition to which it is subjected.26.	Although the drought has abated somewhat  it has become endemic. Thus  in addition to desertification  the Sahel is confronted with other very serious problems  suchâ as the food and energy crisis  which is becoming more acute with each passing day. Water supply for the population is also a problem  as is water for agricultural purposes  which is indispensable.27.	According to estimates made by the Economic Commission for Africa  the degree of food self-sufficiency  which was of the order of 80 per cent in 1975  will be about 60 per cent in 1990 and only 50 per cent in the year 2000 if the present trends are maintained. From the same source we learn that the cereal deficit will double by 1990  and so will the number of people suffering from malnutrition.28.	To be specific  while between 1973 and 1980 the cereal imports of the eight Sahelian countries were of the order of 800 000 tons a year  they exceeded a million tons in 1982. According to estimates of FAO  consumption may amount to 7 million tons in 1985 and 9 million tons in 1995  with import needs estimated at two or three million tons over the last decade of the century. Indeed  cereal production has shown an increase of 1 per cent a year while the population has increased at a rate of over 2.5 per cent a year. It is estimated that the population of the Sahel  which today numbers about 31 million  will reach about 50 million by the end of the century.29.	We are aware that to meet the growing food shortage  an increase in production is absolutely indispensable  and that is why Sahelians have been devoting substantial efforts to the difficult struggle thus imposed upon them. For this  it is necessary not only to lay down a coherent policy for development but also to find ways of bringing about more active participation on the part of the people  to adapt structures to the needs of development and undertake large-scale action in the fields of training and research.30.	Similarly  the development of rain-watered and irrigated crops must be accompanied by action to protect growing and stored crops.31.	The struggle against pests that damage and destroy crops m6st also be intensified  side by side with the development of cultivation  and be the subject of joint programmes both nationally and regionally.32.	As water is a rare commodity in the Sahel and the existing supplies are seriously threatened by drought and even by pollution  special attention must be given to the problem of water supply for the people. Of the 70 000 water-supply points which it is estimated will be needed by the year 2000 to ensure the minimum supply of drinking water in accordance with the recommendations of WHO  there existed about 18 000 at the beginning of 1982; that is  only 25 per cent of the needs were covered.33.	Thus it is understandable that our organization  CILSS  should give priority to water supply projects in the Sahel  and we are sure that the international community will once again understand our concerns and thus make it possible to alleviate the burden that the search for this precious liquid represents for Sahelians at present  particularly for the women. The gravity of the situation confronting the Sahelian countries does not admit of partial or improvised solutions. That is why the application of a rural development strategy which would lead to self-sufficiency and food security and the restoration of the ecological balance is a fundamental priority of our regional organization  CILSS  which has since its foundation in 1973 undertaken a series of actions to remedy agricultural deficits  to curb desertification and to create the necessary conditions for integrated development throughout the region.34.	CILSS reflects a profound awareness not only of the dangerous degradation of the environment in the region but also of the need to meet the challenge of nature in a coherent and coordinated manner. If the work of CILSS has had repercussions beyond the frontiers of the Sahel  it is because all those who in one way or another are sensitive to the problems of the region have found in it an appropriate framework for demonstrating the human solidarity which today is more necessary than ever.35.	At the time of its foundation 10 years ago at Ouagadougou  our organization was given the task of coordinating all activities in the fight against drought and its effects at the subregional level. It was also given the task of making the international community aware of the problems of drought and mobilizing the resources needed to carry out the emergency programme laid down by the States and to finance operations. There was also the task of seeking financing for common programmes.36.	In 1976 CILSS  in co-operation with the Club du Sahel  laid down a development strategy for its member States up to the year 2000  and for the period 1977 to 1982 it worked out a series of integrated projects known as first generation projects I shall try to retrace the most significant stages covered by CILSS in the course of its existence.37.	The result of the historic decision to establish the organization in 1973  CILSS reflected the combined efforts of member countries to confront the grave situation which threatened to exterminate our peoples. In 1976 the secretariats of CILSS and of the Club du Sahel produced short-term  medium-term and long-term strategies for development based on preliminary FAO studies. From 1977 to 1982 our organization moved towards the initial programming of its work  which could be described as short-term programming. As a result  a number of projects were identified. The third Conference of Heads of State and Government or CILSS  held at Banjul in 1977  made its First-Generation Programme the sole sphere of action for CILSS for the period 1977 to 1982  and thus it became the first joint enterprise by the member countries in their struggle for survival. At its fifth Conference of Heads of State and Government  at Praia inJanuary 1982  a progress report for the First-Generation Programme was presented. An analysis of the situation demonstrated that the financing obtained was about 60 per cent of the project costs.38.	In the medium-term  for the period 1982 to 1990  we had to reformulate all the policies of CILSS by working out sectoral assessment programmes  which will make it possible to go into further detail on the work of each sector. We might characterize this medium-term period as the second-generation programme  the purpose of which is not only the establishment of a diagnosis of action carried out in the framework of the First-Generation projects but also a reformulation of programmes  with new guidelines which would make possible a transition to a new generation of projects that would no longer be confined to limiting the consequences of the drought but would become a true development project for the Sahel  giving pride of place to water supply.39.	Over the long term CILSS proposes to bring about the full restoration of the Sahelian ecosystem and food self-sufficiency  which are the ultimate objective for which we are mobilizing our joint efforts.40.	Although the international community is continuing to assist our organization  I had to appeal for an increase of their assistance on the occasion of my visit to FAO last November  in the light of the progressive decline of the Sahel and the size of the problems facing Sahelians. Indeed we know that  in spite of joint action on the part of the States in question and considerable external aid  the situation in the Sahel has hardly improved in its fundamental aspects. Climatic vicissitudes and the international situation have something to do with this. The Sahel has made no progress towards food self-sufficiency. Food aid is perpetuating itself. Certain countries are in an alarming economic and financial situation.41.	In my capacity as current Chairman of the Conference of Heads of State of CILSS  I am once again appealing to the international community to increase its help to member States of the CILSS in their development programmes and their campaign against desertification. This help is needed for carrying out development projects already designed and approved by the respective Governments; for executing already designed and approved regional projects to fight desertification; for basic studies needed for learning the potential for development at the national and regional levels; for establishing and/or strengthening research and training institutes at the national and regional levels to find solutions to the limitations of the programmes already mentioned; and for strengthening national and subregional capacity in the planning  management and evaluations of integrated development action.42.	We are aware that food aid is not the solution sought by the people of the Sahel for the problems confronting them  but we should like to reiterate the fact that it is essential to maintain this type of aid  particularly in view of the disappointing rainy season during the present harvest season  which has made it necessary for us to plan for considerable food shortages.43.	Various agencies of the United Nations family have participated in the development efforts of the Sahel. In recent years they have increased their activities  and we are sure that with the support of all  this improvement will become even more tangible.44.	In particular  we must mention the important role played by FAO and UNDP  either directly or through the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office  in the struggle to achieve the priority targets of CILSS.45.	Permit me  on behalf of the heads of State of the member countries of CILSS  to extend our thanks to ail the countries and organizations which have joined us in this titanic struggle against desertification and its consequences.46.	However  we must not lose sight of the fact that the work of CILSS began and is being carried on in a period of international recession  with a strong tendency towards a decline in development assistance.47.	The difficulties of financing the action advocated by CILSS and which various United Nations agencies have undertaken for our benefit are obvious. However  financing such action is urgent  since only the implementation of these programmes will enable us to prevent further catastrophes. Without this action  the Sahelian peasant will have to continue waging a bitter struggle for survivalâa struggle in which so many of his predecessors have lost their lives and which is based on empirical methods which  more often than not  only make the situation worse.48.	Desertification knows no frontiers and is a process which feeds on itself. If the international community is not capable of making available to our countries means to enable us to halt its progress  problems will persist without any lasting solution and the granting of aid to ease hunger caused by drought will have to go on  while desertification will continue to extend until all life becomes impossible in the affected regions. If this should happenâwe hope that it will notâthe very survival of mankind will be at stake. History has examples of civilizations which have disappeared because of such lack of foresight.49.	In making known to the international community our profound desire that it give more attention to the threats hanging over the Sahel and grant assistance to overcome them  we hope that it will adopt  as a basic principle that such assistance be extended to us on acceptable and tolerable conditions.50.	A Sahelian contribution is necessary  even in a precarious and fragile ecosystem. Sahelians have imposed such a contribution on themselves. Proof of this is the affirmation of our joint political determination and perseverance in efforts even when any investment seems  at first sight  to be useless and doomed to failure. We are fighting tenaciously to create more decent living conditions  investing the bulk of our efforts in the elimination of the scourges which threaten our future.51.	We also think that CILSS stands at a decisive point and that a reorientation of its strategy has become necessary. Its activities must be adapted to new and urgent needs in the region so that it can focus its efforts on well- defined priority areas  thus making a greater contribution to the development of the Sahel.52.	When we speak of the Sahel  we cannot lose sight of the overall context in which we live and in which we are trying to resolve the problems of this region.53.	The current crisis is a structural crisis of a system which has already demonstrated its inadequacy in today's world and its inability to meet the just demands of the peoples. It is not by indefinitely postponing the establishment of a new international economic order that means will be found to overcome that crisis.54.	However  we cannot allow the present difficult situation to discourage us. We believe that the developing peoples and countries must persist in dialogue and consultation  because  in the absence of any alternative other than total failure and collapse  this approach is an historical imperative.55.	The touchstone of our struggle is the full blossoming of our potential for independence  which will make it possible to revive our development efforts on the basis of full use of the productive capacities of our countries. In this context international co-operation is an external complement to the creation of bases for development aimed at satisfying the elementary needs of each community.56.	In Cape Verde we know that  in order to meet the challenges we have consciously set for ourselves  we must rely above all on our own efforts. But as we have developed as a people  we have also learned the value of solidarity among men.57.	We are proud of the fact that although our country is small and has been devastated by drought  the international community has judged us worthy of benefiting from significant assistance. It is thanks to this assistance that drought  which has persisted since the mid-1960s  no longer necessarily means death by starvation in Cape Verde. It is thanks to this assistance that our country has since its independence recorded economic growth indicators which have been encouraging even to the most sceptical among our development partners.58.	However  we must manifest our concern at the increase in disquieting trends in official development assistance  which belie the relative optimism with which two years ago we ended the United Nations Conference  on the Least Developed Countries.59.	For us  development assistance will be attaining its true objectives only if it ceases to be a mere palliative for emergency situations and becomes an actual stimulus and support for the mobilization of internal productive forces. The task is not to maintain artificially a moribund corpse  but to give it the proper treatment so that at the end of a reasonable period of time it can walk on its own feet.60.	Furthermore  there can be no doubt that increasing development assistance is the only path leading to true integration and the expansion of the world market and thus to a reversal of the trends towards recession affecting it at present.61.	The right to peace  security and development is a corollary of the sovereign equality of States. Theoretically  all States are equal. However  even though this principle may be valid juridically speaking  there is no analogy on the sociological level  where differences between States are enormous. There are rich countries and poor countries  countries possessing weapons capable of massive destruction and others that are defenceless  countries highly developed economically  scientifically and technologically and others that have not even reached a stage of economic viability and are struggling for the most elementary survival. The listing of differences could go on indefinitely to lead us to the conclusion that  internationally  the prevailing reality is that of unequal development.62.	The non-aligned countries and the developing countries have demonstrated by their actions that countries can enjoy equal sovereignty only if their development is equal.63.	Since peace is an indispensable condition for social progress and economic development  only a climate of detente  disarmament and renunciation of the arms race can be conducive to the rational utilization of their potential on the basis of co-operation from the more favoured countries.65.  The right to a peaceful life is not only an individual right but also a right of peoples which can be achieved only through the institution of a new international economic and legal order. However  respect for such a right is far from being the rule in the practice of international relations.66.	Over the last 30 years the world has seen more than ISO armed conflicts  most of which have been fought in third world countries. It is not surprising that the violent and systematic denial of the right of peoples to development and to peace and security has been reflected in a series of violations of individual rights  beginning with the most elementary such as the right to life  to the free development of the personality  to food  to education and to work. The individual will never be protected as long as the right of his people to exist is called into question  as well as its right to become free from domination by all means at its disposalâwhether it be the case of a colonised people or an occupied countryâthe right to choose freely the political system to assure its economic and social development  according to the role its has selected for itself  the right to dispose freely of its wealth and natural resources  and the right to eliminate any form of foreign economic exploitation.67.	Traditionally  international law proclaims equality without taking into consideration the profound differences existing among States. From this standpoint  the non-aligned countries have made a decisive contribution to the strengthening of international law and to the defence of sovereign equality  taking into account the facts of international life today.68.	Always  and especially at this time  peace has represented the profound aspirations of all peoples of the world. It is here that the instinct for survival as a human community has prevailed over the forces which are provoking an unbridled arms race  so-called limited wars  the devastation of countries  the annihilation of peoples  destabilization and permanent crisis.69.	The struggle for peace is being waged on several fronts and must always guide the work and actions of governments  both internally and externally. This is why in Cape Verde  a strategically located archipelago at the crossroads of the Atlantic  we proclaim and repeat our firm wish to provide a haven of peace and dialogue and to prevent by all means our country ever becoming a source of tension among nations and peoples.70.	That is why the Government of Cape Verde has based its conduct on the relentless defence of the principles of non-alignment and on the charters of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity  on non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries  on the search for relations of mutually advantageous cooperation and on the protection of the prerogatives of sovereignty  independence and freedom of thought and action. It is upon the vital necessity of struggling for peace that Cape Verde bases its action as a country which can be useful in the search for means of extinguishing hotbeds of confrontation which still exist on the African continent.71.	The United Nations is more than ever necessary for the international community. It is evident that we are living at a decisive turning point for mankind. On the other hand  we know how delicate are the transition periods  particularly when the world has witnessed an accumulation of an unimaginable potential for destruction which has been building up over the last few decades.72.	Coming generations will judge us on our capacity to manage this transitional phase. The United Nations is therefore increasingly called upon to play the role of guarantor of mankind's ability to cross the frontiers of the new era opened to it by the technological revolution  on the basis of peaceful relations and lasting co-operation among States.73.	In this context  I cannot conclude my statement without expressing my confidence in the determination of all Member States to continue to support effectively the institutions of the United Nations  and in particular the Secretary-General  in the efforts to promote peace  development and international security. "
"34",1643,"CRI",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 The people and Government of Costa Rica welcome the accession of a new State  Saint Christopher and Nevis  to independent life and to the United Nations. We were pleased to be present at the solemn celebration of its independence. We extend to its people and Government our wishes for prosperity in freedom and a national life full of accomplishment and constant development.2.	International co-operation is an essential element in achieving the principles embodied in the San Francisco Charter in the sphere of human rights. In pursuance of those principles  the United Nations has adopted  among other instruments  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol  thus upholding the principle that the human being is the subject matter of international law.3.	A great deal has been done in this Held. Regrettably  none the less  there still remain victims of discrimination by reason of colour  race  sex  religion or national origin. Millions of people  particularly in the third world  live in conditions of poverty unworthy of the human being. Regrettably also  the numbers of refugees increase because of persecution for ideological reasons  foreign occupation and forced displacement caused by military conflict.4.	I should like to take this opportunity to express thanks on behalf of the Government and people of Costa Rica to UNHCR and the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration for the attention given to the great problem of refugees in my country. We have registered 11 464 refugees thus farâone third of the total numberâbut the flow of refugees in the past months  particularly that of Nicaraguan refugees  has increased rapidly. In March this year 45 refugees per week entered our country  and in October the average rate is 175 per week. This is a tremendous burden to Costa Rica  and we hope for international co-operation to resolve the conflict.5.	So much violence  injustice and poverty illustrate the vast task we must carry out in the human rights Held in order to make them a reality for everyone. States' compliance with the principles and legal instruments protecting those values is an indispensable factor in that urgent endeavour  which is intrinsically related to peace  but we must rely on other machinery as well to make the work of the United Nations more effective and expeditious. Eighteen years ago Costa Rica  understanding that need  proposed the establishment of a United Nations high commissioner for human rights. That initiative has had many ups and downs  but the need for it is felt increasingly. It is not the first time in the United Nations that a good idea takes a long time to yield fruit.6.	We hope that at the next session of the Commission on Human Rights  of which Costa Rica is a member  the resolution recommending the creation of a high commissioner's of the will be adopted. The proposal is not intended to be a panacea for the ills afflicting the world in the field of human rights  but the high commissioner could be an important factor in improving the situation and going beyond rhetoric. We urge all delegations to give careful attention to that initiative  which has been given serious study by the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. That Sub- Commission has helped to dispel doubts concerning the mandate of the high commissioner  whose work would provide the United Nations with another tool in the struggle which has already given it so much prestige.7.	One serious danger to peace is what was so eloquently described by President Betancur as  this insidious disguise of barbarity which is terrorism   whose most recent manifestation was the Rangoon tragedy  where a group of high government officials from the Republic of Korea were killed  where an attempt was made on the life of its President and where the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was plunged into mourning. The United Nations must wage an intense struggle against that dangerous scourge of modern man.8.	There is a need to reactivate the process of peace through national reconciliation in Central America  Cyprus  Korea and Chad. This is true of Lebanon as well  where such reconciliation requires the withdrawal of foreign troops. It is as urgent there as in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. There is also an urgent need for peace for the noble Palestinian people. I reiterate here what I stated last year: Costa Rica is confident that we are not far from the day when that long-suffering people can at last live at peace with its neighbours in a territory where it can assert its national identity.9.	Another terrible scourge is that of racism  which is so odiously manifested in South Africa. The international community must redouble its efforts to convince that country that its behaviour violates the fundamental values of mankind today. The tension caused by the conflict in South Africa is also a threat to world peace.10.	One other manifestation of institutionalized racism and continuing colonialism is the illegal behaviour of South Africa in Namibia. Costa Rica had the honour of hosting the first regional symposium organized by the United Nations concerning that situation. On that occasion  the President of Costa Rica  Luis Alberto Monge  reaffirmed our determination to contribute  within the United Nations framework  to efforts to bring about the self-determination of Namibia and affirmed that  no force  interest or consideration alien to the legitimate will of the Namibian people to establish the Government of its choice should be allowed to weaken the pressure of the international community on the Republic of South Africa to comply with the United Nations resolutions on the problem of Namibia. 11.	The thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly is taking place in the midst of an unprecedented crisis which particularly afflicts the developing countries. It is a crisis which  as President Mitterrand has said  widens the gap between the rich  who are increasingly rich in spite of the crisis  and the poor  who are increasingly impoverished because of the crisis.12.	The experience of recent years demonstrates that the world economy cannot work properly with the restrictive policy of the industrialized countries  the high rates of interest  the increasing indebtedness  the squandering of resources on weapons in both North and South and the social inequalities that exist within both poor and rich societies and lead to increasingly superfluous consumption. The stagnation of the financial system and the weakening of the sources of the growth of production have created untenable imbalances and generated a crisis which cannot be resolved through the traditional economic policies. The seriousness of contemporary problems makes necessary a reformulation of existing relations in the world economic order.13.	What particularly concerns us in this bleak general picture is the foreign debt problem of the developing countries. The non-industrialized nations today have debts amounting to $700 billion  loaned for the benefit of creditors and debtors alike. On the one hand  the efforts to control inflationary pressure in the industrialized countries by restricting the supply and demand of money moderated the growth of production and trade and reduced the demand for local credit. On the other hand  in the developing countries it was necessary to compensate with external credits for the income lost through a decline in the value and volume of exports and the further imbalances caused by an increase in the price of oil for the importing countries. The convergence of excessive liquidity in the hands of the international banking system and the developing countries' growing need for external financing resulted in the creation of a situation whose seriousness calls for joint action by the industrialized and the developing nations.14.	It is essential that the entire international community heed the appeals to begin the urgent task of global negotiations. The first signs of an economic recovery that is restricted geographically and limited to certain sectors should not be a reason for closing the door to those negotiations  which concern the future of the entire international economic system. We should not make the mistake of thinking that a few nations can by themselves bring about lasting well-being.15.	The heavy burden of indebtedness of the third world nations endangers the health and the future of the world economy. Several developing countries  including Costa Rica  have shown an unprecedented sense of responsibility in imposing upon themselves austerity programmes which in many cases endanger their political and social balance. For example  Costa Rica has managed to control inflation. At the beginning of 1982 the inflation rate was 85 per cent per annum  and it has now been reduced to 17 per cent per annum. It has acted similarly to tackle the phenomenon of currency devaluation. Our exchange rate in 1982 was 64 colones to the dollar  and today it is 44 to the dollar. All this has been done at a high social cost which has tested the strength of our democratic institutions. This has taken place  and is taking place  during critical times  when the contraction of international trade  the marked deterioration in the prices of primary commodities and the ruinous terms of trade all work against us and the sacrifices that have been accepted by our people. Today  when the poor nations give daily proof of their good will and sense of responsibility  North and South must work together to formulate a new pattern of international economic relations so as to bring about justice through equitable distribution of the fruits of progress  giving new momentum to the process of development and also distributing responsibilities equitably.16.	It must be clear that partial actions taken by some countries in collaboration with the major international institutions  although necessary and useful  can be only a first step towards more complete structural action.17.	At the thirty-seventh session from this rostrum  I commented on the initiatives promoted by Costa Rica to bring about peace in Central America. I spoke of the Forum for Peace and Democracy and the peace plan for Central America adopted at the San Jose conference held on 4 October 1982  with the participation of eight foreign ministers. The immediate result of the Forum was the creation of the Centre for Electoral Consultation and Promotion. That Centre is now establishing a group of experts able to provide  on request  services to Governments and public bodies in regard to the better conduct of voting procedures. It functions in San Jose and is part of the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights  which also has its headquarters in the capital of my country.18.	What we are seeking to ensure through the activities of the Centre is that the will of the people  respect for which is essential to the exercise of the right of self- determination of the peoples  is expressed as authentically as possible through periodic  free and honest consultation of the people. Elections must be not only a means of expression of the people's acceptance of the system of governing the destiny of the nation  but also an essential criterion for deciding whether or not in any given country democracy is working. This is so because the exercise of electoral rights  together with that of all the other human rights  makes the ordinary individual's participation in the Government of his country possible  genuine and significant.19.	The realistic and imaginative San Jos6 peace plan was followed by other joint efforts when the Contadora Group was formed  with its own commendable and sincere initiatives. Costa Rica was pleased to welcome that Group because it saw in it the development of the ideas put forward at San Jose  strengthened and enriched by the political will of four Governments that foster harmony and international solidarity. After many months of determined work  in September in Panama  the five Central American foreign ministers and the four from the Contadora Group prepared the Document of Objectives ' which is to play such an important role in the future. Costa Rica participated constructively in its drafting  with initiatives that were reflected in another document  entitled  Bases for peace in Central America   which was presented by Costa Rica  El Salvador  Honduras and Guatemala. My Government also proposed a link between the ideas of peace and democracy  and that concept too was welcomed. All that work gave a strong impetus to the Contadora process and made it possible to progress beyond the initial statements and begin a stage of talks in which the political will of the Central American Governments would be tested. The parties concerned will soon set about giving legal form to the Document of Objectives with a view to its implementation. We are approaching the moment of truth.20.	In the last analysis  we must ensure real freedom  and to achieve that noble and fundamental purpose we must promote the establishment in Central America of truly democratic Governments  so that in each country there will be  as is already the case in Costa Rica  political arid legal mechanisms capable of dealing with the social demands and problems with respect for the essential dignity of the human person. That is possible only when the citizens participate in the political process and in all social activities in complete freedom.21.	Therefore  Costa Rica is confident that the Contadora process will soon reach its ultimate goal. Of course  many difficulties will have to be overcome. Some will arise as a result of the complex nature of the problems at the root of the crisis  others as phenomena promoted in order to hamper the work being done to bring about peace.22.	The achievement of detente in Central America now and of lasting peace subsequently is basically the responsibility of regional bodies or mechanisms. Regional bodies are more suitable and appropriate than universal ones because they are closer to the circumstances and are better able to appreciate the causes of the occurrences and the reasons underlying the attitude of the countries involved in each problem or conflict. In the view of Costa Rica it makes no sense to confuse the issue and bring into the debate  as Nicaragua has done  those who have little basis for judgment and might  in spite of their good faith  be victims of harmful manipulations.23.	My Government today reiterates its support for the Contadora process  because peace is its earnest aspiration. Why does Costa Rica want peace? This question might seem at first glance to be redundant  because peace is essential in any society. None the less  a careful examination shows that there are some that impose peace in order to eliminate any vestige of a free  creative or even rebellious spirit. That is the peace of the totalitarian State  of a monolithic societyâa peace that subjugates. Others  on the other hand  promote peace so that all ideas may merge irrepressibly and assert themselves with full vigor. That is the peace of a democratic State  of a pluralistic societyâa peace that is life-enhancing.24.	Since the dawn of its existence  Costa Rica has had the good fortune to live in peace and develop a democratic society  in the constant and zealous search for styles of life consistent with the dignity of every inhabitant of the country. Democracy works in Costa Rica because it is a faithful reflection of the nature of Costa Ricans. There is nothing artificial or imposed in our political system. Democracy works in Costa Rica because Government institutions correspond to the way of thinking  the feelings and the beliefs of the people  that is to say  to its culture. It is the people that determines its destiny through periodic free and honest elections and participates in public office through its representatives or directly by constant control of the leaders  helped by the free expression of opinion. Similarly  in order to fulfil civic obligations and other social and individual tasks  the citizens make an intelligent use of the law. Costa Rica is a country that believes deeply in law as the fundamental means of bringing harmony to the society and making it possible for a constant process of change to take place. That is why electoral rights are enshrined in a special chapter of the Political Constitution  separate from the one that is devoted to the other human rights.25.	This highlights its great importance. In that chapter we have the guiding principles for the electoral process and the basic prerequisites for exercising it. At the top of the system the Political Constitution puts an electoral high court with full jurisdiction to act independently of the legislative and executive branches. The pluralism of ideas expressed in the country fully and without limitation daily strengthens and tests the political system. The right to establish political parties is guaranteed in a constitutional clause  and in practice those organizations fulfil the complex and essential functions assigned to them in the modem State for the progress of government. Four political parties are represented in the Legislative Assemblyâtwo major parties and two minority partiesâand they reflect the spectrum of contemporary political thought.26.	Pluralism is reflected as well in the functioning of the press  which is in the hands of private individuals and which acts with complete freedom  aware of its decisive role in safeguarding the democratic institutional apparatus. There are four newspapers and several weeklies  seven television stations and more than 100 radio broadcasting stations. The State has only one television station and one radio station  for cultural purposes.27.	Freedom of worship is complete and is constitutionally protected. Artistic performances are varied  rich in expression and free from interference by the State. This alone suffices to answer the question  Why does Costa Rica want peace? . But we have other data further underscoring Costa Rica's desire to continue to live as it has thus far.28.	Costa Rica allocates .2 per cent of its gross domestic product to education and 7.8 per cent to health costs. This contrasts with the 0.7 per cent allocated to the police forces in the country. Public expenditure per capita on education and health is 20 times higher than that allocated to the police forces. As a result of this allocation of resources to social development  life expectancy in Costa Rica today is 73.2 years  and 80 per cent of the population is covered by the social system  while there are other systems covering almost the entire population. Of the nine goals set by WHO for the year 2000  Costa Rica has already achieved seven. As to the other two  in 1983 we achieved 85 per cent of the target for one. With regard to chronic diseases  such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer  we hope to achieve the target in the near future. As regards education  at the present time 92 per cent of the population is literate  reflecting an educational system which is mandatory and universal.29.	Therefore  Costa Rica wants peace in order to continue its progress towards the goals of individual and community growth. It does not want peace for repressive purposes internally or for aggressive purposes externally. Of course  there are great obstacles and dangers that the people must overcome in its indefatigable struggle for individual freedoms and general well-being. At the present time Costa Rica is confronting the obstacle of the world economic crisis  to which I have already referred. The impoverishment of broad sectors of the population puts pressure on the political system almost to the point of preventing its emergency adjustment machinery from functioning effectively  with the consequent negative effects on social stability. Costa Rica wants peace in order to correct this situation  always within the framework of democratic institutions.30.	The upheaval which is afflicting the brother peoples of Central America also threatens the peace of Costa Rica. As the tyrannies of the past several times endangered the democratic vocation of Costa Rica  the Costa Rican people is now afraid that dictatorships of another character may interfere in the activities of a society which only pursues progress in freedom. Costa Rica wants peace in order to avoid the realization of its fears in Central America.31.	My country is not involved in the armed conflicts taking place in other parts of Central America. Its neutrality is a result of its respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and the fact that 35 years ago it banned the army as a permanent institution in order to devote its resourcesâas I have already pointed outâto social programmes of great priority. None the less  this does not mean that my country is not concerned by what is happening in the region. On the contrary  Costa Rica feels that it is bound to continue to promote vigorously and tenaciously the united participation of the international community  especially the democratic community  in the establishment of a climate conducive to freedom. In this way the Central American conflict can be settled  leading to the creation of genuinely democratic political institutions and thus to the firm establishment of the reign of peace which Costa Rica desires  for its own benefit and for the benefit of all its brother countries.

"35",1689,"CSK",38,1983,"ï»¿97.	 I wish to congratulate Mr. Jorge Illueca on his election to the office of President of the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly. I wish him and the Secretary-General every success in the?' responsible work.98.	I wish also to express appreciation for the work of your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  of the Hungarian People's Republic.99.	I welcome to our midst the new Member of the United Nations  Saint Christopher and Nevis  and sincerely congratulate it on achieving independence.100.	The period that has elapsed since last year's session of the Assembly has unfortunately been marked by a further escalation of the struggle between the two main diametrically opposed forces of the present day. On the one hand there are those that are nudging the world towards increased tension  escalation of the arms race and the possibility of nuclear war  and on the other there are those that are striving to strengthen peace  international security and co-operation.101.	The efforts of militarists to upset the existing military balance and to pile up more mountains of weapons have met with the growing resistance of the masses  whatever their political views or religious convictions. This was clearly borne out at the World Assembly for Peace and Life  Against Nuclear War  held at Prague last June. The capital of Czechoslovakiaâa country where the Second World War  the most horrifying war of history  both began and endedâthus became a forum for the exchange of the most humanitarian ideas.102.	From the rostrum of that forum  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia  President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  Gustav Husak  stated:""Despite the gravity of the situation that we jointly face today  we are convinced that there is still time to take the necessary steps to prevent world developments from continuing along the dangerous spiral of increased tensions  and to set them on the path of building confidence  developing mutually advantageous co-operation and lessening both political and military tensions. Everything possible must be done to avert the danger of war  whether it be a global war or a limited one  a major war or a small one.""103.	In the light of this requirement  the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and our Government were fully in accord with the recent statement made by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Yuri Andropov  concerning the fundamental issue before the world today  namely the safeguarding of life in peace  that most vital interest of mankind. They were also highly appreciative of the firm position of principle taken by the Soviet Union  which once again demonstrated to the whole world that the pursuit of peace  security and co-operation among nations is the basic principle of its peaceful Leninist policy.104.	Indeed  the current international situation shows convincingly how urgent it is to translate this position into concrete deeds. Over the past year  we have noted a further evident deterioration in that situation. It is an alarming state of affairs  which calls for immediate and radical therapy.105.	Why is this so?106.	What are the real causes of this unfavourable diagnosis? Where  figuratively speaking  should we look for the seat of this dangerously spreading infection that is undermining the stability of the entire international community?107.	After a thorough analysis and careful consideration of all the facts  we noted a few days ago in a joint communiquÃ© issued in Moscow following our talks with Andrei Gromyko  member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  First Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Foreign Minister of the USSR  that:"". . .the complicated nature of the present turn of events in Europe and in the world arena in general is a direct result of the actions of aggressive imperialist circles  especially those of the United States of America  which are trying to achieve military superiority so as to impose their will on others and to dominate the world. They are implementing unprecedented military programmes  fanning hotbeds of tension and conflict  and are ever more grossly interfering in the internal affairs of many countries and peoples. They are systematically undermining normal relations between States with different social systems by whipping up militaristic hysteria  by ideological sabotage  by shameless falsifications and slanders against the socialist countries designed to deceive the peoples and by staging major acts of provocation that flout the basic norms of international law.""108.	In this complex situation it is necessary above all  as we see it  to break out of the impasse that exists with regard to the question of eliminating the danger of an outbreak of nuclear war.109.	This sword of Damocles hanging over civilization constantly threatens it with catastrophe and devastation. Losses would not be counted in terms of cities  but in terms of whole continents. We reject the prospect of a Euroshima or a Eurosaki. We vigorously protest against the dangerous plans for the deployment of new United States medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe. Such deployment would upset the existing military balance in Europe in favour of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  We in Czechoslovakia cannot remain indifferent to such a deployment. After all  the Pershing II missiles are to be deployed a mere 180 kilometres from our borders. That represents a flight lasting only a few tens of seconds.110.	Along with broad sections of world public opinion  therefore  we wait for the United States to abandon its fruitless rhetoric at the Geneva talks and finally to show willingness to reach an agreement that respects the principles of equality and equal security. It is precisely this crucial principle that is the foundation of the recent significant Soviet proposals  which are further proof of its constructive  honest attitude. The proposed path towards an agreement justly takes into account the legitimate interests of both sides. The United States would refrain from deploying missiles in Western Europe and the Soviet Union would reduce the number of medium- range missiles in the European part of its territory to a level equalling the number of British and French missiles and would dismantle all missiles involved in such reduction.111.	The stakes are high. The success of the Geneva talks could steer world developments into calmer waters. On the other hand  their failure could be the harbinger of risks and uncertainty. Everything now depends on what position will be taken by the United States. Will it heed the voice of reason  or will it continue to temporize and place its stake on the deployment of the Pershing and cruise missiles in Western Europe  thus placing its European allies in the unenviable role of hostages  on whose territories the deadly weapons would be stationed  who would not be involved in a decision on whether they should be used  but who would bear the full brunt of the dreadful consequences entailed in the deployment of these weapons  including retaliatory strikes?112.	I therefore wish to emphasize that Czechoslovakia does not reject any realistic proposals for the solution of the current complicated situation. Nor  indeed  does it reject the zero option. On the contrary  Czechoslovakia is fully in favour of a zero optionâbut a zero option in which zero really means zero: zero for the medium- range nuclear missiles  zero for tactical nuclear weapons  zero for land-based missiles  zero for nuclear weapons launched from the air  zero for missiles launched from the sea  zero for aircraft carrying nuclear bombs and zero for aircraft carrying nuclear missiles; in other words  zero for all systems capable of delivering nuclear charges.113.	How many of these were stationed by the NATO countries in the continent of Europe alone  and where they were targeted during the last three post-war decades was generally knownâwhether these were the land-based Matadors  Thors  Pershing I  Honest Johns  Little Johns  Lance missiles and atomic howitzers of various calibres  or the submarine-based Polaris and Poseidon missiles  or the Starfighter and Phantom aircraft. To understand the threat that these weapons posed to our old continent  it was not really necessary to be a West Point graduate. On the other hand  the Soviet Union  ever since the United States held the atomic-bomb monopoly  has always been merely attempting to catch up with the United States superiority in nuclear weapons and  in the second half of the 1970s  merely responded essentially to the megatons of nuclear death already installed on the European continent through the modernization of its nuclear potential and the deployment of what in English terminology is known as ""surface-to-surface 20"" missilesâ that is  the SS-20sâby which the Soviet Union merely maintained approximate parity  something which at that time  by the way  nobody questioned.114.	It must therefore be stated quite frankly that if new United States missiles are deployed in Western Europe this approximate parity will be upset and an entirely new military-strategic and political situation will be created. This must be stated quite openly  particularly to those who seek to obscure reality with tricky computer games with numbers  with haggling about the number of missiles  with puzzles about ""dual decisions""  alleged ""zero options""  ""interim solutions"" or ""global ceilings""âall of which serve but one purpose: to confuse the public so that people can no longer make their way through this confusion of numbers  the maze of proposals and the tangle of declarations and thus can be intimidated by an alleged Soviet superiority or threat  and so that the situation can be used for the actual deployment of missiles.115.	It must be stated very unambiguously that if United States missiles are deployed in Western Europe  they will pose a strategic threat to the Soviet Union and to all the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. Our countries will be forced to take necessary measures to respond to this threat  in order to ensure their own security and to create a necessary counterbalanceâincluding measure that will affect the territory of the United States itself. This must be realized in complete seriousness and in the full sense of these words. The statements of the socialist countries on this issue are already a matter of record. Furthermore  the Czechoslovak statement made on 3 June 1983 remains fully in force; in that statement we give complete support to the position of the Soviet Government and the steps it feels are indispensable to ensure the Soviet Union's own security and that of its allies.116.	However  so long as the deployment of United States missiles in Europe has not yet begun  we are of the view that an agreement is possible. There is still time. Let us not forget that in politics chances that are wasted are not usually repeated. It is therefore in the interest of both Europe and the whole world that an agreement be reached at Geneva.117.	The socialist countries have through tangible deeds consistently promoted and continue to promote a constructive policy of peace. The continuity of that policy is reaffirmed in the Political Declaration adopted at the Prague session of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty. The backbone of that document is the proposal for the conclusion of a treaty on the mutual non- use of military force and the preservation of peaceful relations between States parties to the Warsaw Treaty and those in NATOâthe two strongest political-military alliances in the world. Having been entrusted with the dissemination of that important document  Czechoslovakia duly brought it to the attention of the majority of the States Members of the United Nations.118.	The response that we encountered almost everywhere confirmed that the cause of peace is uppermost in the minds of the people of all the countries of the world. The Committee of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty  in their meetings at Prague last April  elaborated further procedures for the implementation of the peace proposals in the Declaration. Our readiness for a serious exchange of views between the two alliances was once again confirmed.119.	We emphasized in particular that the proposed draft treaty pursues the objective of elaborating in international law and making firm in different treaty documents the principle of the non-use of force formulated generally in the Charter of the United Nations. It proposes the adoption of the principle of not being the first to use either nuclear or conventional weapons against each other. Further  it contains the commitment to maintain viable peaceful relations and to develop them purposefully and actively on the basis of reciprocity. It provides for the right of all non-aligned and neutral countries of all continents to accede to this proposed treaty. In a word  it strengthens peace and averts the danger of war.120.	We are of the opinion that it is essential to start constructive negotiations on the draft of this treaty without delay.121.	The positive results of the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe offer proof that even in an aggravated international political climate it is possible to achieve concrete measures for its improvement. The conclusion of the meeting by the adoption of a substantive and balanced Concluding Document  which embodies the continuation of the policy of peace  detente  East-West dialogue and the development of comprehensive co-operation on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act ' represents a victory of political realism and confirms the incontestable truth that political will and action are the motive power in the solution of problems which at first glance seem insoluble. The results of this meeting may well pave the way to a new phase in the process initiated by the Helsinki Conference  whether at Vienna in 1986 or at any other working-level consultations and meetings. Particularly significant  in our view  is the decision to convene next January at Stockholm the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. The relevant Czechoslovak bodies were charged with the implementation of the provisions of the Concluding Document of the Madrid meeting in accordance with the laws of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.122.	The urgent need nowadays to search for and to find a common language and to strive through negotiations for mutual understanding and the solution of existing problems is in sharp contrast with certain negative phenomena of recent weeks. What I have in mind is  first of all  the ferocious anti-Soviet campaign surrounding the incident with the South Korean aircraft. This testifies to the fact that the whole purpose of the deliberate instigation of hatred and slander is to obscure the far-reaching and well-prepared military-political provocation against the USSR in the Far East. Equally unheard-of was the refusal to provide guarantees for the safe participation in this session of the Foreign Minister of the USSR  Mr. Gromyko  one of the drafters of the Charter of the United Nations  a participant in the founding conference of the Organization and the representative of a country which is a permanent member of the Security Council. This is a flagrant violation of the 1947 agreement between the United Nations and the host country  which explicitly states that the Federal  state or local authorities shall not impose any impediments to transit to or from the United Nations Headquarters of the representatives of Member States  irrespective of the relations between the Governments involved.123.	These and similar actions illustrate the psychological war unleashed by imperialism and extended  as a matter of policy  from the field of ideology to international relations. They represent attempts to draw public attention away from the fact that it is imperialism which tramples basic human rights under foot every day  in particular  the most fundamental rights  the right to equality of all people and the right to live in peace.124.	In vain  however  do the highest representatives of imperialism cast themselves daily in the role of arbiters of all things occurring in the world  arbitrarily falsifying history and describing the post-war map of Europe as the result not of agreements but of acts of force. In vain do they depict the socialist order as the source of all evil or the garbage heap of history. In vain do they  even from the soil of neutral countries  refer to socialist countries as savage and primitive  countries which long before Columbus produced schools of thought and jewels of world culture. In vain do they accuse the representatives of these countries of ""brutal acts""  manufacturing vicious and careless lies  and insulting them with expressions taken from the language of the gutter. In vain do they incite the peoples of socialist countries against their own Governments with frenetic rhetoric from the studios of their radio stations  which in itself is a political rarity that in every respect equals the most extreme verbal assaults from the time when the cold war was at its peak.125.	As far as we are concerned  ""we shall never stoop to such an undignified way of conducting a ""discussion"". Ideological non-coexistence  yes. Psychological warfare  no. We shall never answer lack of breeding with the same behaviour. Such an approach is not in keeping with our principles or cur policy. Our truth does not require blustering words. Its strength lies in the historic mission of our social order  which is scientifically predetermined to replace the departing order.126.	This is a fact nobody can change  not even those who exploit their fellow manâwho is also created in God's imageâand appropriate for themselves the surplus value created by his labour  the principal source of his capital and his wealth; not even those who leave millions of people unemployed; nor those who deny their fellow citizens the right to free education; nor those who do not provide free medical care. In other words  not even those representatives of monopolies and military-industrial complexes who  in defence of their class interests and profits  turn their ""humanism""  as Yuri Andropov noted recently  into ""new heaps of weapons of mass destructionâfrom MX missiles to nerve gas containers"" 127.	The proposals of the Soviet Union on such questions as the ""condemnation of nuclear war"" and the ""freezing of nuclear armaments"" made from this rostrum yesterday are  in our view  a constructive and  at this time  extremely significant contribution to the implementation of the ideals of the Charter concerning international security and the maintenance of worldwide peace. We fully associate ourselves with their purpose and content  as well as with the request that they be included in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly.128.	With regard to the course and the results of this year's session of the Committee on Disarmament  we cannot say that we are fully satisfied. Nevertheless  we continue to regard the Committee's activity as being of extraordinary importance. Experience so far has shown that  given sufficient political will on the part of its members  the Committee has in the past been able to work out and adopt important international legal documents which  to a certain degree  have curbed the arms race.129.	The development of the situation shows that it is also necessary to take further urgent measures to prevent the militarization of outer space. For that reason we welcome and fully support the significant new proposal made by the Soviet Union for the conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the use of force in outer space and from space against the Earth. We highly appreciate the unilateral commitment of the USSR not to be the first to launch any type of anti-satellite weapons into outer space  as long as other States  including the United States  refrain from so doing. We regard this proposal as a sound basis for the solution of the question of the demilitarization of outer space.130.	We are of the view that the whole range of disarmament issues can be resolved only through realistic  consistent and purposeful international co-operation on the basis of equality and equal security. The principles for such co-operation have been laid down in the Declaration on International Co-operation for Disarmament which was adopted  on the basis of our initiative  at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly on The timeliness and the lasting significance of that document were confirmed by the adoption of relevant resolutions at the two most recent sessions of the Assembly. We believe it would also be useful for the current session to deliberate seriously on this matter and to adopt appropriate recommendations. My delegation is prepared to take an active part in that work and to contribute to it by submitting a specific draft resolution.131.	The growing threat to peace is also reflected in the flaring up of old hotbeds of tension and in the creation of new ones. The imperialist circles are further escalating their policies of blackmail and diktat. They are interfering in the internal affairs of other States  and they are using force on all continents.132.	Developments in the Middle East are indeed alarming. The deterioration of the situation caused by the Israeli aggression against Lebanon and the Palestinian people is proceeding with generous support from world reaction. The reckless actions of the Israeli expansionists aimed at speedily changing the demographic character of the occupied Arab territories further increase the urgent need air a speedy  just and comprehensive peace settlement.133.	It is  moreover  deplorable that Washington is resorting here to direct armed intervention in an effort to expand a military-strategic bridgehead to allow it to interfere in the entire region. The cease-fire agreement reached by the parties to the internal Lebanese conflict must be welcomed. However  lasting peace can be achieved only through the complete and immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon and from ether Arab territories. The interventionist troops of the United States and other NATO countries should also leave Lebanon.134.	Of even more pressing urgency appears to be the need to halt the senseless war between Iran and Iraq and to reach a settlement of the disputed issues between them on the basis of mutual respect for their independence and territorial integrity.135.	We commend the efforts which have been made by the Government of Afghanistan to achieve a peaceful settlement of the situation prevailing around Afghanistan and to improve relations with neighbouring countries Pakistan and Iran. The Afghan-Pakistani talks held through the mediation of the personal representative of the Secretary-General made a significant contribution to that end.136.	We are in full solidarity with the struggle of the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea  which continues in difficult conditions for the defence of freedom  independence and unity against the interference of external forces and against open subversion. We support the peaceful policies of the countries of Lido-China  which are striving to resolve disputes in South-East Asia through dialogue. It is also high time that the General Assembly finally recognized the authority of the true representatives of the Kampuchean people  who have done so much to heal the wounds caused by the Pol Pot regime.137.	We support the efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful reunification of Korea and the withdrawal of United States troops from the southern part of the country.138.	We welcome the recommendation for the settlement of the question of Cyprus contained in General Assembly resolution 37/253. Respect for the independence and the sovereignty of Cyprus is a prerequisite for its implementation. The talks between the representatives of the two communities  which were positively influenced by the personal initiative of the Secretary-General  may play a significant role in this respect.139.	We formally protest the racist policies of the Government of the Republic of South Africa. It must terminate its unlawful occupation of Namibia  as well as its barbaric sorties against neighbouring independent States  particularly the People's Republic of Angola. The people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  must be given an opportunity to exercise its right to self-determination  freedom and national independence  as laid down in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. This should be done immediately without any pre-conditions and obstructions created by South Africa or the so-called contact group.140.	There is no peace or stability in that important region of the world  Central America. The pronounced deterioration of the situation that has occurred there since the last session of the General Assembly must be ascribed to the escalation of acts of aggression directed against Cuba  Nicaragua and Grenada  and against the national liberation movement in El Salvador. We denounce this hegemonistic policy of imperialism towards Central American countries. We appreciate the efforts of the State of the Contadora Group to resolve the crisis in Central America by means of political negotiation.141.	This applies equally to the southern part of the continent and some of its unresolved problems  among them the problem of the Malvinas Islands  which poses a threat to the peace and security of the entire region.142.	We appreciate the activity and the positive part played by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  its contributions to the struggle to restore the international situation to health  to halt the arms race  to establish lasting peace and to achieve the peaceful settlement of conflicts in various parts of the world. We attach considerable value to its seventh summit conference  held at New Delhi  which addressed an appeal to the nations and peoples of the world asking them to develop broad mutual co-operation in the solution of international problems as well as in democratizing relations among States through the establishment of a new and just international economic order.143.	Therefore  we watch with concern everything which stands in the way of these objectives. One such development in particular is the sharp increase of protectionism and discriminatory tendencies on the part of the West. In an effort to blunt the impact of the economic difficulties in their own ranks  the respective capitalist countries have turned their Ore against many of the countries in Asia  Africa and Latin America. They have also tried to export these difficulties to the socialist States. These are policies which we denounce.144.	In conclusion  I should like to express my belief that the United Nations will be even further involved in normalizing and improving international relations. May I in this context recall the position formulated in the Political Declaration of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty at their Prague meeting last January  which says that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of and to strengthen the role of the United Nations in international affairs as an important forum for uniting the efforts of States in order to strengthen peace and international security and to promote the resolution of pressing world problems. I can assure you that Czechoslovakia  which is one of the founding Members of the United Nations  will do its utmost to ensure that the Organization  the integrated expression of the aspirations of peoples to peace  may achieve the noble goals which it set for itself 38 years ago.  "
"36",1712,"CUB",38,1983,"ï»¿100.	 Mr. President  you have been entrusted with the enormous responsibility of directing the proceedings of this thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  which is taking place under exceptionally complex conditions. The fact that we know you and that you come from the beloved sister land of Panama  whose long tradition of struggle for the salvation of national sovereignty  along with its contribution to the search for peace and negotiating formulas for the long-suffering Central American region  are very well known  allows my delegation  after extending our warmest greetings to you   express our full confidence in the success of your mission and  at the same time  to assure you that you will always be able to count on the assistance of the Cuban delegation for the success of this session.101.	We also extend greetings to our friend Mr. Imre Hollai  President of the General Assembly during its thirty-seventh session.102.	We welcome the admission to the United Nations of another Latin American and Caribbean State  Saint Christopher and Nevis.103.	In a review of the long list of very important matters to be discussed at this session and which command our attention  the imperative necessity of avoiding the eruption of a confrontation that could bring to an end the very existence of mankind must be given the highest priority.104.	Never since the end of the Second World War has the international situation shown signs of such extreme peril  nor has mankind been so close to nuclear apocalypse. For this reason  I believe we all agree that once again  but with greater courage and dedication  we must endeavour to ensure that our deliberations and subsequent decisions lead to progress in the complicated and difficult process of disarmament and to the strengthening of the peace and security which our peoples demand in order to devote themselves to the noble effort of economic and social development.105.	Imperialist intransigence and the Reagan Administration's zest for supremacy and power  which is expressed on a daily basis in its obsolete cold-war rhetoric and gunboat policies  constitute the major obstacle faced by the international community in eliminating the dangerous climate in which we currently live.106.	For our part  we are fully aware of the fact that  notwithstanding the decisive role played by the international community and the peace movement throughout the world  the greatest responsibility for adopting disarmament measures ultimately rests with the nuclear Powers. Essentially  however  the main responsibility rests with the two mightiest Powersâand we all know exactly who complicates the dangerous present situation and prevents its being overcome.107.	The Government of the United States  dragging along its allies in NATO  considerably increases its war budget  extending the arms race to new horizons. It unilaterally interrupts important negotiations on specific questions  while blocking others it cannot stop because of the high political price attached to them; and at the same time it does everything possible to stifle the work of the international organ of negotiation  the Committee on Disarmament.108.	We must add that besides dashing the hopes embodied in the SALT II agreements  an attempt is now being made to destroy the limited legal order thus far achieved on the question of disarmament by alleging false violations or breaches of promise or the fallacious intention of strengthening them with new provisions regarding verification.109.	It is not enough for Mr. Reagan and his advisers to enjoy the destructive potential of the United States with all its weaponsânuclear or otherânor is it enough for them to extend the threatening language of weapons to other areas of our natural habitat. They are not at all interested in considering the wishes of other peoples when they station nuclear weapons and delivery systems in their territories to launch attacks on neighbouring borders  thus exposing them to a devastating riposte.110.	The United States Government refuses to commit itself not to be the first to use nuclear weapons; it does not accept the offer of a mutual freeze of existing nuclear arsenals  nor of their qualitative and quantitative development; it turns a deaf ear to the establishment of a moratorium on nuclear-weapon tests; it develops and produces lethal binary chemical weapons; it develops the neutron bomb; it reinforces old silos to deploy the aggressive strategic MX missilesâall of which is done without abandoning the continuous build-up of its submarines  ships  aircraft  tanks  guns and other instruments of aggression and destruction.111.	NATO'S United States-inspired plans to install 572 medium-range missiles in Europe are particularly serious. This decision constitutes an extremely dangerous  adventurist and grave step which threatens to bring the world to the brink of war.112.	Those of us who follow attentively and anxiously the development of negotiations being conducted on that subject at Geneva clearly assess the delaying tactics on the part of the United States  which  juggling deceitful options for propaganda purposes  vainly pursues unilateral concessions which would enable it to obtain advantages and establish its military superiority  thus upsetting the present balance. The international community represented at the United Nations must  as a matter of urgency  demand seriously and responsibly the results it expects from Geneva and save the old continent of Europe from the serious threat that hovers over it.113.	The ground on which we stand and the seas that surround us are no longer enough for the United States. It is now dangerously aiming at outer space  sending up space weaponry with which it dreams of imposing its supremacy  power and law on the whole world.114.	We must pool our efforts to defend the first right of mankind: the right to live.115.	It is necessary to strive to ease the present climate of tension and not to despair in the search for ways and means leading to agreements which  on the basis of parity and equal security  would contribute to the limitation and subsequent reduction of the levels of weapons  particularly nuclear weapons.116.	The States members of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries  meeting recently at New Delhi at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government  firmly reiterated the demand of the entire international community that the arms race be halted and that disarmament agreements aimed at establishing a climate of peace embracing all regions and benefiting all peoples be adopted.117.	The will for peace of the socialist countries is an unquestionable fact  made evident by various initiatives and at times by unilateral arms limitation measures  which  as everyone knows  are only rejected by the United States  when they are not simply ignored.118.	While the world yearns for peace  the United States is moving towards war. The tragic incident of the South Korean aircraft which was sent off without any qualms to commit an act of indescribable provocation falls within the framework of the attempts to exacerbate tensions.119.	The international community is faced with the tragic case of an aircraft which violated Soviet airspace and remained for a long time over Soviet territory  ignoring the warnings issued in accordance with international guidelines  and for that reason was brought down  with the regrettable loss of 269 lives. It became known later that this was a civilian aircraft which had strayed from its normal course. We are certain that Soviet military aviation would never have fired on that aircraft  even if it was on an espionage mission  had they realized that it was a civilian airplane carrying passengers. There is no doubt that it was mistaken for one of those spy-planes which are constantly probing the borders of the Soviet Union in that zone.120.	This tragedy  about which no one can think without grief and sorrow  has been used by President Reagan and his Administration as a means of fanning international hatred and enmity and justifying the arms race and their aggressive war-mongering policies.121.	Those who are against solving the problems of Central America through negotiated non-military solutions and whose brutal international policy supports the Salvadorian regime which has caused tens of thousands of deaths among the civilian population of El Salvador in recent years; those who see fit to disrupt the process of social change in Nicaragua  even if to do this they must carry out direct or indirect military intervention against that country; those who trained  instigated and supported the individuals who then committed a barbarous act of sabotage against a Cuban civilian aircraft over Barbados; those who stood by in silent complicity when  in February 1973  Israel shot down a Libyan passenger aircraft  causing 108 deaths  over Egyptian territory occupied by force; those who encouraged the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and must share responsibility for the genocidal acts which  a little over a year ago  left thousands dead in the Palestinian camps of Sabra and Shatila; those who support the South African racists in their illegal occupation of Namibia and their aggression against Angola and the front-line States  which have cost tens of thousands of lives; those whose spy-planes have been flying over Cuban territory for many years  shamelessly and openly violating our airspace  using first the U-2 aircraft and now the more sophisticated SR-71  flying provocatively over the whole island and trying in vain to frighten our people; those who do not even reply to the notes of protest sent by our Government  the most recent of which was in September this yearâthose it is who now hypocritically rend their garments and accuse the Soviet Union of an act whose roots lie in the international tension which they themselves create and in an act of provocation in which a commercial aircraft was used without any qualms and innocent people were sacrificed.122.	We believe that collective international measures should be taken to prevent tragedies such as this. We are all duty-bound to adopt codes of conduct forbidding the employment of civil aircraft in espionage activities. The use of incidents of this kind further to foment international hatred  justify armament and aggression and create a climate conducive to war rather than peace is wholly unacceptable.123.	The latest in the long list of provocative actions undertaken by the United States Government against the Soviet Union  using the South Korean aircraft incident as a pretext  is the preventing of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union from participating in this session of the General Assembly. To this act of provocation against the respected representative of one of the permanent members of the Security Council they have added proof of their disregard of their obligations as the United Nations host country.124.	If peaceful existence on our planet is to be achieved it is of paramount importance that the international situation be improved by eliminating current insecurities and restoring a climate of trust and detente in international relations.125.	The peoples demand an end to the arms race and the abandonment of the philosophy of military supremacy and the endless accumulation of weapons  which can lead only to the peace of the graveyard.126.	Today  perhaps more than ever before  mankind demands that decisions be made and agreements adopted which will pave the way to security  peace and development. 127.	As part of these efforts we include support for the United Nations and for the activities of the Secretary- General. It is well known that those who work against peace do not conceal their contempt for the Organization. We believe that the highest priority should be given to continuing action to attain the principles and objectives of the Charter and to strengthen the broadest international co-operation within the framework of the United Nations.128.	The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries is striving for peace and development and for the elimination of colonialism  neo-colonialism  imperialism  Zionism  racism  apartheid and every form of exploitation and domination. Its successful seventh summit conference was a new step forward in terms of unity and cohesion and made a contribution through its decisions to the achievement of those goals.129.	On the other hand  the economic crisis which in recent years has severely affected the economies of the capitalist world continues to make its effects felt increasingly in the countries of the so-called third world. The reduction in real terms of the transfer of resources for development; the unprecedented and increasing foreign debt  for which there seems to be no likelihood of a reasonable short-term remedy; the even greater deterioration in the terms of trade; monetary instability; the transnational corporations' activities and plundering; and the growing difficulties faced by underdeveloped countries in gaining access to sources of funds  food and technology continue to characterize the present state of international economic relations. Only the genuine restructuring of these relations  without unnecessary delay and through a comprehensive process of co-operation  can provide a true long-term solution of these serious and potentially dangerous problems facing the world today.130.	The proceedings and results of the important international meetings held this year have shown the determination of the underdeveloped countries to find solutions likely to reactivate the international process of economic co-operation. Regrettably  the reactions of the industrialized capitalist countries to their proposals have not permitted the resumption of a truly significant process of international economic negotiations aimed at restructuring international economic relations to provide for the effective establishment of a new international economic order  or  in the shorter term  taking measures immediately for the solution of the most urgent economic problems of the so-called third world. In short  we are witnessing the lowest point in international co-operation: economic co-operation is deteriorating daily  as are the prices of the main exports of our underdeveloped countries. For this reason  just as we must devote ourselves to the search for solutions to the world economic crisis  we must also devote all of our efforts towards rapidly overcoming the crisis in international economic co-operation.131.	The global negotiations continue to be the most important question before the General Assembly in the sphere of international economic negotiations. Consequently  the talks designed to lead to their speedy implementation must be given momentum and direction so that they can begin in 1984 in a comprehensive  interrelated and coherent manner  in keeping with the proposals of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries.132.	Cuba's positions of principle on the most urgent  serious and important problems of international relations are known. On every occasion the voice of our people has been clear in one way or another. Fighters for freedom and independence in any part of the world have never lacked our word of encouragement. Those who face oppression  discrimination and exploitation have never lacked our most active solidarity. Those who uphold the highest ideals of their peoples have never lacked the ready warmth of the Cuban revolution. Our word of encouragement  our friendly hand  our active solidarity  our fraternal warmth will never be lacking for all those  whether in Government or in opposition  whether in power or in the struggle against oppression  who confront the joint forces of reaction  colonialism  neo-colonialism  racismâincluding zionismâapartheid and imperialism.133.	From this forum of nations the Cuban people salute the Sandinist soldiers who defend with honour the sacred soil of their land; the Salvadoran fighters who with exemplary courage confront imperialist Power  displaying an extraordinary fighting capacity; the Guatemalan patriots struggling for more than 20 years against the genocidal regime imposed by the United States since 1954; the heroic and brave people of Grenada who face with determination all imperialist attempts to subvert their internal order and halt the powerful development of their revolutionary process. We also ratify our solidarity with Suriname  which is still being subjected to many destabilizing acts of aggression by the United States to frustrate the process of social change and national liberation that has begun in that country.134.	The Cuban delegation reiterates its unflagging support for the inalienable right of the fraternal people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence. On some not-too-distant day  Puerto Rico  freed from colonial ties  will join the group of independent and sovereign countries and  as such  will occupy its proper seat in this world Organization.135.	We also support the aspirations of the Government and people of Panama in their struggle for the fulfilment of the Canal treaties. We support the historic and just demand of Bolivia to regain access to the sea. We support the independence  territorial integrity and non-alignment of Belize. In accordance with its position of support for a negotiated solution of conflicts  and within that framework  Cuba is in favour of a peaceful solution of the border disputes between Guyana and Venezuela. Similarly  we hope that  in conformity with the General Assembly's resolutions  negotiations can be started immediately between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Argentine Republic to restore the Malvinas  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands to Argentina. We also express our deep concern over the British Government's decision to build a military base in the Malvinas  which not only hinders negotiations on the decolonization of the islands but also adds unnecessary tensions to the region. We salute the valiant Chilean people who are today unanimously rising up against fascist tyranny. We also salute all the peoples of the southern part of the Americas who are struggling for democratic freedom and for an end to repression and oppression in their countries.136.	We salute the efforts to guarantee peace and stability in South-East Asia  and we urge continued efforts to achieve that important goal. A spirit of mutual understanding and respect conducive to a climate of security must prevail in the region of South-West Asia also  and efforts to pursue a constructive dialogue between the parties in conflict must also be continued.137.	The Cuban delegation renews its support for the just cause of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea in its search for the peaceful reunification of that country and calls for an end to interference in its internal affairs and the withdrawal of the interventionist United States forces from the south of the Korean peninsula. 138.	We support the aspiration of the Comoros to recover its sovereignty over Mayotte. We support the restitution to Madagascar of its rights over the Malagasy Islands of Glorieuses  Juan de Nova  Europa and Bassas da India  and the just demand of Mauritius to recover the island of Diego Garcia. We support the sustained efforts of the people of Cyprus to preserve its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity in a united and non-aligned republic.139.	Cuba wishes to repeat once again its appeal to the Governments of Iraq and Iran to end the war that for more than three years has been inflicting enormous loss of life and of all kinds of resources on their peoples and that constitutes a threat to international peace and security.140.	We salute all peoples who  in other continents  are also struggling for their independence against imperialism and reaction. We salute the brave Saharan fighters for their legitimate right to live in peace and to occupy their rightful place among the independent States. We salute our dear Palestinian friends who  rallying around the PLO  their sole and legitimate representative  firmly hold high the banner of their just struggle. We salute the brave patriots of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole and legitimate representative. We salute the stoic and dauntless fighters of South Africa led by the ANC. We salute all the front-line States  which are resisting with determination the pressures  threats and attacks of the racists and imperialists. We salute the Arab States  permanent victims of imperialist and Zionist aggression. We salute the determined people of Libya  who face the threats and provocations of imperialism with serenity and resolve.141.	The current state of affairs in Central America has mobilized broad sectors of world public opinion. The ever-increasing concern over an irreversible escalation on the part of the United States is fully grounded.142.	The countries of the Contadora Group have made enormous efforts in the quest for a negotiated settlement of the explosive situation in that region. At its summit meeting at Cancun last July  the Contadora Group- made up of Mexico  Venezuela  Colombia and Panamaâ appealed to the Central American countries  as well as to the United States and Cuba  for co-operation and support in the quest for a political solution.143.	Nicaragua immediately responded to that appeal with a six-point programme  which includes its readiness to initiate multilateral negotiations in the presence of the Contadora Group and to sign a non-aggression pact with Honduras  and its willingness to reach an agreement regarding El Salvador that would include the cessation of all arms supplies to both sides.144.	The Farabundo Marti Front for National LiberationâRevolutionary Democratic Front reiterated its readiness to seek  through dialogue  channels of negotiation which would lead to peace in El Salvador. At the beginning of September it proposed the installation of a new Government  representative of all forces  which would be responsible for bringing about the conditions required to advance a comprehensive process of political solutions to the Salvadorian conflict.145.	Cuba also promptly and clearly responded to the summons by the presidents of the Contadora Group and let it be known that it unhesitatingly supports the efforts to bring about a just and negotiated settlement of the problems in Central America.146.	The United States  for its part  continued its brutal escalation clearly designed to destroy the Nicaraguan revolution  dismember the Salvadorian revolutionary movement and safeguard its full imperialist domination in the region. Under the pretext of joint military manoeuvres with other countries of the area  the duration of which has no parallel in history  the United States Government is attempting to create an intimidating situation which constitutes a real and dangerous intervention in the area and irrefutable proof of its aggressive militarist policy. Such an interventionist step taken by the United States under the pretext of military manoeuvres reminds us of the criminal actions of the military forces of that Power in the Lebanese conflict.147.	Nicaragua finds itself virtually blockaded  surrounded by military bases  troops  shipsâincluding aircraft carriers from the Mediterraneanâand fighter planes.148.	At this moment an unabashed and virulent aggression is being launched against Nicaragua from bases in Honduran territory. Thousands of former Somozist guards  drilled  trained and advised by American officers  are harassing the sacred soil of Sandino's land  cruelly assassinating the civilian population. Time and again they penetrate Nicaraguan territory and are repeatedly beaten back by the armed forces and Sandinist militias  fleeing terrified to the sanctuary provided by the immunity of the Honduran border. The Sandinist combatants have not allowed themselves to be dragged into a provocation and have respected the borders of their neighbours with the conscientiousness and zeal with which they would want their own respected.149.	Honduras finds itself under virtual United States military occupation  illustrated by the adoption of decisions on the entry and presence of United States troops in that country  without the so-called Honduran President or Congress being informed. The Green Berets are running a Honduran army infantry centre under construction in the Pacific port of San Lorenzo. In addition  600 members of the Corps of Engineers and Marines are engaged in the construction of new facilities  including a landing strip near the Nicaraguan border. In mid-September 1 000 new Salvadorian soldiers reached Tegucigalpa en route to the United States base at Puerto Castilla on the Honduran Atlantic coast. Previously 1 200 were trained at the Regional Military Training and Security Centre. Furthermore  the United States has more than a thousand experts in Honduras  of whom 950 form the logistical support contingent of Palmerola Air Base at Comayagua  in the centre of the country.150.	In the same way  Guatemala is becoming a possible springboard for Yankee military intervention in the area. United States and Israeli military aid to Guatemala is destined to strengthen the army in its effort to annihilate the Guatemalan revolutionary movement and to prepare it for the eventual intervention in El Salvador and Nicaragua.151.	American Government circles are obsessed with the idea that the imposition of a military solution to the conflict in Central America is possible and advisable. Under the feeble pretext of preserving the  third border   they are sliding down a slope that will plunge them into a quagmire  but what else can be expected of those who still think in terms of  spheres of influence  and endorse the feasibility of a  limited nuclear war ? Obsessed with creating a climate of terror and insecurity in Nicaragua in order to destroy the revolution and attack the national liberation movement in the area  the Reagan Administration may reproduce a new Viet Nam in America itself.152.	Peace-loving governments  the peoples of the world and those forces that struggle for international security and peaceful coexistence are called upon to make every effort to prevent the intensification and spread of this conflagration.153.	A war of larger dimensions in Central America would only add pain to pain and misery to poverty  but it will never mean victory for the imperialists. We therefore support the request that the General Assembly at its thirty-eighth session devote special attention to  the question of Central Americaâthreats to peace  sovereignty and the exercise by the Central American peoples of the right to self-determination and peace initiatives   as stated by the Co-ordinator of the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction  commander of the revolution Daniel Ortega Saavedra  in his address to the Assembly .154.	History shows us that in the long run force has never been able to prevent the triumph of freedom  social justice and sovereignty of the peoples. Our President  Fidel Castro  was unquestionably right when he recently said that  A truly revolutionary and patriotic people may be physically wiped from the face of the earth  but it can never be conquered .155.	History has also shown that fire will be met with fire  violence with violence  and that nothing and no one will be able to retard the progress of peoples towards their legitimate and true independence. Nevertheless  this is not the only road that our people are obliged to travel  nor is this always the price that they must necessarily pay for their freedom.156.	I wish to avail myself of the opportunity offered by my presence at this important international forum to reiterate on behalf of our Government and people Cuba's positions with respect to the Central American situation. Cuba advocates a proper and honourable solution based on mutual commitments. Neither intimidation  force of arms  blackmail  pressure  nor a vain hope of surrender and concessions will pave the way to a lasting and stable solution. A solution based on the bludgeon and on contempt for the most fundamental principles cannot be imposed on Nicaragua  nor can an unfavourable outcome of the conflict be imposed on the Salvadorian revolutionaries. Methods which ignore  evade or damage the primary interests of the Salvadorian revolutionary movement cannot be applied  nor can Nicaraguan interests be ignored.157.	Peace cannot be achieved or coexistence and security in the region activated on the basis of forcing one of the parties to suffer humiliation.158.	We support the spirit and proposals of the Contadora Group to find a political solution based on respect for the sovereignty of peoples and on non-intervention in the internal affairs of States. Indeed  we wish to draw attention to the fact that a political solution in Central America cannot be achieved unless a peaceful solution is found to the existing situation in El Salvador.159.	The problem in El Salvador today constitutes the crux of the regional conflict. The present state of insurgency in El Salvador is rooted in the centuries-old exploitation by colonialism  neo-colonialism and imperialism. Under the able leadership of their legitimate representative  the FMLN-FDR  the people are waging a tenacious fight against the genocidal regime already marked by infamy and ignominy.160.	The situation in El Salvador cannot be even remotely compared with that in Nicaragua  which from land  sea and air is being subjected to various forms of joint aggression by Yankee imperialism and its lackeys. A dirty  secret war  is being waged against Nicaragua which  although becoming dirtier every day  is each day becoming less secret. There is no internal conflict or civil war in Nicaragua  but external aggression aimed at destabilizing the process of national reconstruction and preventing the consolidation of the Sandinist revolution.161.	Cuba  I repeat  supports the Contadora Group's efforts and is prepared to co-operate in every way it can in the quest for an equitable and proper political solution.162.	With that in mind  I should like to quote the following words of Fidel Castro from an informal talk with a group of American journalists: I agree with Contadora's proposal to seek a political solution based on respect for the sovereignty of States and on non-intervention in the internal affairs of States. He added: It is not precisely a question of concessions; it is a question of seeking an agreement involving commitments by all parties  and in that sense we are sincerely prepared to assume such commitments. We cannot dictate a formula. I think that those who are directly involved in the conflicts are the ones that have to define a formula to reach an agreement. We would then support such a formula. 163.	That is Cuba's position. The path to a peaceful solution of the Central American conflict is still open.164.	Negotiation based on mutual commitments is still possible. The search for a formula that would involve neither capitulation nor unilateral concessions is still feasible. Cuba is quite willing to contribute to progress along that path  to undertake such commitments and to support a formula for solution whereby the parties directly involved in the conflicts may reach an agreement.165.	In its dangerous attempt to reverse the course of history  Ronald Reagan's Administration stubbornly maintains a policy aimed at destabilizing the Cuban revolution.166.	This United States policy against Cuba combines diplomatic  economic and military measures which violate both the spirit and the letter of the Charter of the United Nations as well as the most elementary internationally recognized and accepted norms of coexistence between States.167.	The continuous militarization process that the United States carries out in the area of Central America and the Caribbean is also aimed at military encirclement of our country. This process includes moving additional military units towards the southern coast of the United States and strengthening those already there to unprecedented levels  in addition to the increase in United States permanent military personnel in the area  the forced militarization of the countries of the region and threatening and provocative military manoeuvres and exercises.168.	On the other hand  the self-styled defenders of air navigation safety systematically violate Cuba's airspace with flights by their SR-71 spy planes.169.	The United States also illegally occupies part of the territory of the Republic of Cuba  where against the sovereign will of our people it maintains the Guantanamo naval base.170.	The strengthening of the criminal economic and trade blockade of our country  the efforts and pressures of all kinds exerted on third countries to make them end their trade and financial relations with Cuba constitute not only a form of aggression against our people but also an insult to the sovereignty and national dignity of those countries.171.	The United States has adopted as an unchanging official policy systematic attempts to obstruct and block Cuba's participation in international organizations and forums and unceasingly carries out covert and overt campaigns to harm the diplomatic relations of our country with other sovereign States.172.	In this obstinate determination to defeat the Cuban revolution  Reagan has worked hard to set up a radio broadcasting station with the aim of destabilizing our country through slander and the dissemination of false news to the Cuban people on facts about their own country. For this purpose he has used the illustrious name of Jos6 Martiâan affront to our apostle  who was the first Latin American to discover that the country which in 1776 the fathers of United States independence wanted to be an example of freedom had become an imperialist monster whose decaying entrails he denounced and fought. This effort is laughable but offensive. Neither the defects nor the difficulties of building socialism are ever concealed from the Cuban people  who face them with determination and enthusiasm. But that does not make Reagan's interventionism  less reprehensible nor does it diminish our resolve to reject it.173.	During the Reagan Administration the plans for blatant armed aggression against Cuba have been publicly discussed in an unprecedented manner.174.	These and other threats and measures of imperialism aimed at deviating us from our course  diverting our path and hindering our development will culminate in the most absolute and shameful defeat.175.	Our people are firm in their decision to fight off any attempt and any imperialist aggression  and nothing nor anyone will be able to prevent the impetuous progress of our socialist revolution.176.	The situation in southern Africa continues to deteriorate owing to the actions of the South African racist regime  which persists in its policy of subjecting the black South African people to the most ferocious oppression  exploitation and racial discrimination that history has ever known.177.	The contemptible regime of apartheid increases repression and terror as the patriotic and democratic movement becomes stronger and the opposition to that unjust system and the struggle for its eradication grow. The incarceration for more than 21 years of Nelson Mandela  a combatant of the ANC who has become a symbol of the struggle against racial discrimination on a world scale  is outrageous. The shameless disregard of the South African racists for General Assembly and Security Council resolutions is outrageous. They continue the tortures  massacres  executions and false suicides in South African goals. But even more outrageous is the fact that  despite repeated resolutions of the General Assembly opposing aid to the racists of Pretoria  the IMF continues to grant astronomical loans  while denying them or attempting to impose in exchange for those funds conditions detrimental to the sovereignty of Governments which struggle for a better life for their citizens. No one can deny that responsibility for this rests mainly with the Government of the United States.178.	The Government of Ronald Reagan has proclaimed the legitimacy of its strategic alliance with the racists of Pretoria  and that is the fundamental reason for the perilous situation which persists in southern Africa. We are all aware that only that alliance  accompanied by sordid delaying tactics and brutal pressures  has prevented the peaceful negotiated settlement of the Namibian problem.179.	That is why it has not yet been possible to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The United States Government is primarily responsible for dashing the hopes that many had placed in the efforts of the so-called Western contact group.180.	For more than two years South African troops have been illegally occupying parts of the territory of the People's Republic of Angola  a sovereign Member State of this Organization. The international community has demanded on numerous occasions the withdrawal of the invading South African forces from Angolan territory. The international community has also repeatedly demanded that the illegal occupation of Namibia be ended. But the response from Washington and Pretoria has been the so-called theory of linkage between the independence of Namibia and the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist forces from Angola. There is no record in history of such arrogance  cynicism or total disregard of the decisions of the Organization  which has unequivocally rejected this manoeuvre intended to perpetuate and extend the racist regime in the African continent. Cuba's position on the withdrawal of its internationalist forces from Angola is widely known and shared. The rejection of such a linkage has been reiterated by the front-line States  the Organization of African Unity  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations.181.	In these circumstances there is only one valid alternative: to increase our support for SWAPO as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people; to demand with increasing force the unconditional withdrawal of the racist forces from Angolan territory and the unrestricted implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978); to demand the cessation of all terrorist acts against the front-line countries  all acts of aggression against Mozambique  Botswana  Lesotho  Zambia and other independent African countries  which have resisted in an exemplary manner aggression of all kinds  in extremely difficult circumstances  in order to prevent the expansion of the racist dominion on the African continent.182.	Time and again the United States has impeded with its veto in the Security Council the imposition against the South African regime of the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter. That is why now we must demand more strongly than ever that the United States Government end its policy of blackmail and deceit regarding the African peoples and fulfil the commitments it has made.183.	The Arab peoples of the Middle East are living in a very critical situation. Israel  thanks to the support it receives from the United States  has become a military Power and has unleashed a bestial policy of expansion and domination against all Arab peoples in general and of annihilation of the Palestinian people in particular.184.	Today the danger posed by lack of a solution to the complex situation prevailing in the Middle East has increased  owing to the fact that the American forces stationed on Lebanese soil under the cover provided by the so-called multinational forces have taken an active part in the fighting in Lebanon  thus making a reality of the old dream of American imperialists of penetrating and dominating the Middle East.185.	Lebanon  which was the target of aggression by the Israeli hordes that are still present in its territory  is now also the target of direct aggression by the United States. The combined forces of zionism and Yankee imperialism will not be able to crush the independent spirit of the Lebanese patriots who are now defending their soil from external aggression. Some day  sooner rather  than later  Lebanon will be able to exercise its full rights as a free and sovereign nation. 186.	We do not doubt that the Assembly will try to set in motion the machinery necessary for reaching a just and lasting solution of the Middle East problem. This cannot happen  of course  until the Palestinian people are fully able to exercise their inalienable rights to self-determination and independence and to create their own sovereign State in Palestine  under the leadership of the PLO  their sole legitimate representative.187.	This is indeed a suitable occasion on which to support the right of the PLO to occupy a seat in this great assembly of the United Nations.188.	It is not possible to conclude our statement in the Assembly without directing our thoughts and recollections to the immortal figure of Simon Bolivar on the bicentenary of his birth. His revolutionary action  his efforts on behalf of independence  his dreams of unity for the peoples of America are neither forgotten nor consigned to history; they live in the life blood and the daily struggle of our peoples for a future of peace and development. 	"
"37",1758,"CYP",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 It gives me great pleasure  Sir  to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. This is undoubtedly a reflection of the great international appreciation of  and the prestige enjoyed by  your country and its people as well as of your eminent qualities as an experienced diplomat and an outstanding international lawyer  demonstrated through years of dedicated and fruitful service to your own country  to Latin America and to the United Nations. It is pertinent to state on this occasion how much we value the strong bonds of friendship existing between Panama and Cyprus  two small States but strong advocates of the principles and purposes of the United Nations.2.	At the same time  I wish to place on record our praise of and our profound esteem for Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  who during his presidency guided successfully and with singular distinction the thirty-seventh session  including its resumption. His diplomatic skills and wisdom won for him the respect of all. We in Cyprus shall always remember his official visit to our country  which gave us a most welcome opportunity to express to him once again our deep appreciation for his dedicated service to the United Nations and for his true feelings of friendship towards Cyprus and its people.3.	It is with particular pleasure that I refer to the Secretary-General and to his untiring efforts to strengthen the United Nations and ensure its effectivenessâsomething which is of absolute necessity for peace and security in the world. We sincerely hope that his endeavours to resolve international problems  including the Cyprus problemâpursued with the diplomatic skill  wisdom  patience and determination which characterize the Secretary-Generalâwill bear fruit for the sake of humanity. For our part  we must all do what we can to assist the Secretary-General in his high task. Peace and prosperity in the world can be achieved only if a genuine collective effort is undertaken by all the members of the international community. Such a collective effort is now more urgent than ever.4.	The threat or use of force in international relations  military intervention and interference  the revival of the cold war  great-Power rivalry and the intensified arms race  especially in nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction  constitute a gloomy picture of today's world.The implications of our failure to provide the United Nations with the necessary means to carry out its paramount responsibilityâthat of maintaining international peace and security  as provided in the Charterâare extremely grave.5.	If we are to meet effectively and on a lasting basis the dangers to peace and to the very survival of mankind  we must proceed resolutely and urgently to give the Security Council the means for creating an effective collective international security system in order to deter international lawlessness  to put an end to the ever- escalating nuclear arms race and to revive the prestige of the Organization  tarnished by years of contemptuous disregard for its decisions. It is high time to end the crisis of confidence about the United Nations by demonstrating courage and wisdom and adhering to its principles.6.	The technological advances of today have evolved to an admirable extent. Despite the diversities and the multiplicity of our particular interests and objectives  the human race has converged on a number of topics and has made great strides. We now have the means to greatly reduce the incidence of disease  to combat ignorance  to conquer our immediate universe and to eliminate distance  bringing together peoples and ideas from all continents through advanced means of transportation and telecommunications. However  these ingenious achievements in science and technology are characterized by such grave contradictions that their beneficial effects are countered by potentially dangerous aspects. Thus  nuclear energy could either benefit mankind  if used for peaceful purposes  or destroy our whole civilization and eliminate the human race from the face of the Earth  if used as a weapon of war.7.	The arms race not only increases this threat of human extinction but also diverts the attention and depletes the strength of those who have the material resources and the required technological know-how and who could contribute to the improvement of the quality of life in every corner of the world. It is perhaps pertinent in this context to mention that the estimate of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London is that a record of $800 billion was spent on weapons during the past year. In this century of space exploration it is inadmissible that famine  poverty  illiteracy and disease should still be plaguing significant sections of the population of our planet. With what conscience can we claim to have conquered our immediate universe when human beings are dying from hunger and disease and when thousands born daily will grow up in unacceptable conditions? These contradictions are fed and strengthened by the antagonisms that characterize big-Power relations; antagonisms that are translated into global crises  which in turn are translated into confrontational attitudes resulting in an intensified arms race.8.	The fruits of total and complete disarmament may be for the future generations to enjoyâand we sincerely hope that good sense will prevail in international relations so that there will be future generations. For the present  there must be some steps  even if only modest  in the right direction.9.	The lack of significant results at the twelfth special session  the second devoted to disarmament  should not discourage us. It should rather make us even more determined than before to spare no effort to realize the dream of mankind for development in an international environment of peace and security  without the threat of a nuclear holocaust.10.	It has all along been our firm belief that complete and effective disarmament cannot be achieved without simultaneously setting into motion the system of international security through the United Nations. This thesis was adopted in the Declaration in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session and constitutes its basic directive. It was similarly expressed in a relevant resolution of the General Assembly adopted by consensus  and its early implementation was urged in a subsequent Assembly resolution. Only after a collective security system convinces States that they will not be the victims of aggression can disarmament be effectively achieved on a lasting basis.11.	The responsibilities of the big Powers for the establishment of such a system are immense. But at the same time each and every one of us should carry his own share of the burden. Our responsibility to the human race is now greater than ever before. Cyprus  as a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and one of its founding members  has joined with those like-minded countries working tirelessly for the realization of this goal. At the same time  we shall continue our efforts in co-operation with others for the implementation of the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act ' as we are convinced that these provisions are essential both for detente and for the strengthening of peace  security and cooperation  not only in Europe but also by analogy and by extent in the whole world. Our dedication to the letter and spirit of the Helsinki Final Act  as well as to the principles of non-alignment  is unwavering. The prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations  non-interference in others' internal affairs and respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States are for us sacred principles for which we shall continue to strive hard.12.	Committed as we are to the fundamental principles of non-alignment  we shall continue to pursue a positive and constructive role in international relations  as we have been doing since our independence 23 years ago  in dealing with questions of peace and security and of economic  political and social justice. We shall spare no effort in defending human dignity and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms.13.	With regard to the world economic situation  the structural imbalance between North and South is increasing and the distress of impoverished populations in a number of developing countries is growing. This inadmissible state of affairs is not simply the result of cyclical fluctuations in the international economic system  but also a symptom of inherent structural maladjustments. In our contemporary world of interdependence  a system which fully serves the long-term interests of both the developed and the developing countries is a compelling necessity.14.	We regret that negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order have  for almost a decade now  failed to produce any results. The deadlock over the procedure and agenda for global negotiations has not been resolved  and the efforts to achieve progress in fields such as international economic co-operation  energy  money and finance and trade have not met with success. As a result  instead of development and improvement  we are witnessing an economic stagnation and even retrogression. Thus  the countries designated as least developed have recorded no real growth in recent years.15.	Under these conditions and in view of the reality of international economic interdependence  it is in the interest of mankind as a whole that we all work with sincerity  dedication and persistence for the establishment of the new international economic order. The right of survival  development and prosperity is the right of all mankind. Depriving a considerable portion of mankind of this right is not only unacceptable but also counterproductive. Unless we intensify our efforts to promote this goal  we shall be failing in our obligations towards our own people and towards future generations. No doubt the realization of this goal greatly depends on substantial progress  at least in efforts to ensure international peace and security.16.	The close link between the whole development process and a free  balanced flow of information is also widely recognized. We reiterate our support for the establishment of a new  more just and more effective world information and communication order  which would ultimately change the dependent status of the developing countries.17.	One of the greatest problems of the United Nations to which I have already referred is the lack of respect for its decisions by those to whom they are addressed  as emphasized by the Secretary-General in his reports on the work of the Organization to the General Assembly at its thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth sessions. This problem undermines the purposes and principles of the United Nations  having especially negative consequences for the Organization's efforts to maintain international peace and security.18.	The problem of non-implementation of United Nations resolutions not only impairs the effectiveness and tarnishes the image of *'e United Nations as an instrument for peace and justice  but it also justifiably raises serious questions as to its credibility. As I have indicated in the past  this vitally important item  which Cyprus has already inscribed on the agenda  is worthy of serious and urgent consideration by the General Assembly  where the concerted efforts of the international community could be best exerted to strengthen the authority and effectiveness of the United Nations. Recent developments within and outside the Organization render the examination of this question by the Assembly even more timely. It should be recalled that in the conclusions and recommendations in the Political Declaration of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  the Conference ""welcomed the consideration of the question of the implementation of United Nations resolutions at the forthcoming session of the United Nations General Assembly""  as proposed by Cyprus  Appropriate consultations and constructive ideas which could emanate from the debate in plenary would greatly contribute towards setting the guidelines and finding the modalities of how best we may deal with this most serious problem facing the Organization.19.	We firmly believe that only through implementation of United Nations resolutions can the peace and security sought by the international community be achieved and maintained.20.	My country's commitment to the full protection of human rights  civil and political as well as social  economic and cultural  is well known. This firm commitment is based on our conviction that the ultimate purpose of State policies and action should be the enhancement of human dignity and the full enjoyment of human rights globally.21.	At the same time  it is our strong belief that the standard-setting work  the promulgation of human rights instruments and their application  should be backed by an adequate international implementation machinery if it is to be truly effective.22.	The existence of situations in many parts of the world which involve massive  flagrant and continuous violations of human rights serves to demonstrate that the failure to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms  as expressly provided for in the Charter of the United Nations as well as in other international instruments  is at the very heart of many problems. By providing effective machinery that would guarantee the cessation of such violations  we could contribute towards solving these problems  thus promoting the cause of peace and security in the world.23.	The Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983 under the wise and dynamic leadership of the Prime Minister of India  Indira Gandhi  indicated clearly that despite differences in their social and economic systems  the members of the Movement have resolved to play  through their collective effort  a positive and constructive role for the solution of problems confronting the world today.24.	The Political and Economic Declarations of the Conference  as well as the New Delhi Message  constitute important instruments which we must strive to apply. For our part  we shall continue to do all we can  within our limited potential  at the bilateral  multilateral and international levels to implement the principles and measures for the promotion of peace and justice contained in the Message. We shall continue to oppose imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  apartheid  racism and all forms of aggression  occupation  foreign domination and interference.25.	The critical situation still prevailing in the Middle East is of special concern to us. Because of our historical and friendly ties with the peoples and countries of the Middle East and our proximity to the area of conflagration  we are deeply concerned and grieved about the bloodshed  turmoil and ensuing loss of life. The continuing deterioration in the Middle East poses a clear threat to international peace and security.26.	The Middle East problem  at the core of which is the question of Palestine  will not be solved until a just peace is achieved  based on Israel's withdrawal from all occupied territories and on the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to establish their own independent and sovereign State on the basis of General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX) of 22 November 1974. The Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestine people  must participate in any negotiations if the solution to be found is to be comprehensive  just  acceptable and lasting.27.	As to the situation in Lebanon  we once again reiterate our support for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon. While we hope that the cease-fire will be maintained  we believe that the implementation of Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982) will speed up the search for lasting peace in Lebanon. The Israeli occupation forces must withdraw from all Lebanese territory. We fervently hope that efforts for national reconciliation will be successful  enabling the Lebanese Government to exercise its sovereignty throughout its territory within its internationally recognized boundaries.28.	For three years now  Iran and Iraq have been ravaged by a destructive war with grave loss of life and resources. Over 100 000 people have perished in this grim conflict. The fighting must stop. We appeal to both countries and to all those who can help  to seek a peaceful settlement and to bring this conflict in that sensitive part of the world to an end.29.	The impressive record of remarkable progress in the field of decolonization  especially since the historic adoption of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) almost 23 years ago  should not conceal the fact that there are still  in the era of the United Nations  many countries and peoples which continue to suffer under alien subjugation  domination  exploitation and other forms of colonization. Cyprus  for its part  will continue to support actively and unreservedly all efforts which aim to end the anachronistic colonial era and to bring the membership of the Organization to universality. It is with particular pleasure that we welcome an independent St. Kitts and Nevis to membership in the United Nations.30.	Marring the remarkable record of decolonization is the denial of the inalienable rights of the Namibian people to self-determination  freedom and national independence in a united Namibia  including Walvis Bay and the Penguin and other offshore islands.31.	For the past 17 years  year after year  the international community has unfailingly expressed in this forum its full support for the independence of Namibia. Year after year we have had the opportunity to express our indignation at the intransigent attitude of the racist Pretoria regime.32.	More recently  the Security Council  in resolution 532 (1983)  indicated a time-frame for the implementation of its resolution 435 (1978). At the same time  the Council decided to enhance the role of the Secretary- General. Resolution 532 (1983) clearly articulates the deep dissatisfaction and impatience of the international community over the present impasse in the negotiations on Namibia's independence.33.	The position of Cyprus on the question of Namibia has all along been an unambiguous position of principles. Cyprus  a non-aligned country  a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  and a country which itself had to wage a liberation struggle to gain its independence  is fully committed to and strongly supports the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  as it provides the only peaceful procedure for a peaceful settlement of this major international problem.34.	The question of Namibia is a clear case of decolonization  and as such it should not in any way be linked to other extraneous issues in the region. The attempt of South Africa to link the presence of Cuban troops in Angola with the efforts to find a settlement in Namibia is untenable and only serves to prolong the conditions of injustice being inflicted on the Namibian people. We reiterate our solidarity with the people of Namibia as well as with the front-line States.35.	It is not only the attitude of the Pretoria regime towards Namibia which is inadmissible. Also inadmissible is its continued abhorrent policy of apartheid  which has been repeatedly condemned by the international community. It is obvious that more determined efforts and pressures are necessary to put an end to that intolerable situation.36.	The problem of Western Sahara  which has been of constant concern to the international community since 1975  drags on unresolved. The decolonization of the region is still to be achieved  and the parties to the conflict should strive hard to this end. The Saharan people must be left free to exercise their right to determine their own future. Only through a political settlement arrived at by the parties on the basis of the principles adopted on this matter by the General Assembly  the Organization of African Unity [CMU] and the Non-Aligned Movement will peace be established.37.	Central America also is confronted with a serious political  social and economic crisis  which should be resolved in a peaceful manner so as to avoid wider conflicts which might threaten peace and security in the region. We follow with grave concern the events in Nicaragua and other countries in Central America and sincerely hope that efforts within and outside the Urn led Nations  including those of the Contadora Group  will succeed. What is of paramount importance is that the right of all States in the region to independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity be fully respected  as well as the sovereign right of the peoples of the region to choose freely their own political  economic and social systems without any foreign interference.38.	We attach the highest importance to strengthening global peace  security and co-operation  as I have already stated. It is incumbent on us to seize every opportunity to encourage collective efforts to that end  indeed  in any area of the world. Being a Mediterranean country  Cyprus attaches particular importance to that sensitive area and calls upon all Mediterranean and other countries to test new means of bringing the countries and their peoples ever closer together  for the attainment and maintenance of peace  security and co-operation in the region.39.	The adoption and the signing of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982 by an overwhelming number of States was a notable achievement of the Organization and a source of gratification. This achievement marks a historic contribution of the United Nations in the progressive development and codification of international law for the legal and orderly regulation of world affairs. It is our earnest hope that the Convention will be signed by all States and will receive a maximum number of ratifications at the earliest possible date.40.	At its resumed thirty-seventh session in May this year  the General Assembly dealt once again with the problem of Cyprus and adopted by an overwhelming majority the very important resolution 37/253. This resolution and all the other relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly together contain all the necessary elements for a peaceful  just and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem.41.	The Cyprus problem has been discussed in the Assembly many times and its various aspects are well known to all members. In 1974 Turkey invaded the Republic of Cyprus and occupied almost 37 per cent of its territory. Today  over nine years after that invasion  the Turkish occupation troops are still on our soil  in violation of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations. Turkey has shown complete disregard of those resolutions  including resolution 3212 (XXIX)  which was unanimously adopted by the Assembly and later unanimously endorsed by the Security Council. Nine years after the invasion not one of the 200 000 refugees has been allowed to return; and the fate of missing persons remains unascertained. Over that same period Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership have pursued their plans to consolidate the division and the results of the invasion. They have tried to change the demographic structure of Cyprus by importing tens of thousands of colonizers from Turkey; they have illegally distributed the houses and lands of the forcibly expelled Greek Cypriots; they have issued so-called titles of ownership to those properties; they have replaced the legal currency of Cyprus in the occupied area with the Turkish lira  the currency of Turkey; and they have threatened secession and an illegal unilateral declaration of independence. In these circumstances our quest for a settlement of the problem cannot be successful unless there is a radical change in the attitude of the Turkish side. Only then can there be hope for progress.42.	We were gratified by the Secretary-General's willingness to undertake a personal effort pursuant to the mission of good offices entrusted to him by the Security Council. His effort was explicitly endorsed by the latest resolution of the General Assembly  last May. We have throughout encouraged and welcomed the personal involvement and initiatives of the Secretary-General. It is well known that he has already submitted  as part of his effort  certain soundings for the consideration of the two sides. We have already officially informed the Secretary- General that his personal involvement is welcomed and accepted and that the methodology he proposed is also accepted. We have furthermore submitted our response to his soundings in a most constructive manner and we are very pleased that the Secretary-General himself has described our response as ""a positive and constructive step"". I should like to reiterate once again our readiness to co-operate in absolute good faith with the Secretary- General in our sincere desire to promote a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem in conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations and the high-level agreement.43.	We are aiming at a just solution to the Cyprus problem which will ensure the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. Such a solution would certainly be in the interest of the people of Cyprus as a whole  but in the final analysis it would be in the interest of all countries in our sensitive region and of the cause of international peace and security.44.	We have already made a significant contribution to the achievement of this kind of solution by agreeing to a solution based on a system of federationâsomething which was totally unthinkable in the past. We have already made other far-reaching constructive proposals  such as the demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus  the effective guarantees of human rights and the security of all Cypriots under international supervision. But in no circumstances can we accept any kind of division or partition in any guise. We cannot accept the results of the invasion as a basis for a solution. The basis for the solution of the Cyprus problem is laid down in resolutions of the United Nations and the high-level agreements. The Cyprus problem cannot be solved without the withdrawal from Cyprus of the Turkish occupation troops and without the colonizers' return to Turkey. There can be no solution without the restoration of the unity  human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots  including the right of the refugees to return to their homes.45.	I would like to express the hope that all Members of the United Nations will do their best to assist the Secretary-General in his endeavours and act in conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations. Those countries which are in a better position to exercise influence in Ankara have a special responsibility to do so and must act without hesitation in an effective manner.46.	Our sole aspiration is to turn Cyprus from a place of conflict and strife into a place of happiness and prosperity for all its citizens  in conditions of freedom  democracy and justice  and also into a bridge of co-operation and understanding between the peoples of three continents.47.	the attainment of our goal not only is an imperative necessity for the survival of our own country as an independent State in conditions of freedom and dignity  but would also be an important contribution to the cause of international peace and security  in furtherance of the purposes and principles of the United Nations  to which we must all rededicate ourselves and which we must serve faithfully if we genuinely believe in a peaceful and happier future for mankind.

"38",1826,"DDR",38,1983,"ï»¿102.	 Mr. President  first I should like to offer you cordial congratulations on your election to your responsible office and to wish you and the Secretary-General success in your work.103.	Our sincere thanks go to the President of the thirty-seventh session  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the work he accomplished.104.	The German Democratic Republic congratulates Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission to the United Nations.105.	The period since the start of the last session of the General Assembly has seen a dangerous exacerbation of the international situation. Today  as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic  Erich Honecker  put it  ""the world situation is such that the danger of nuclear war overshadows the life of all nations  threatening an inferno which would amount to self-annihilation of the human race"".106.	The course of confrontation results in a systematic poisoning of the international climate. How unscrupulously the Soviet Union has recently been provoked yet again is shown by the refusal of the United States authorities to make proper arrangements for the safe participation of the head of the Soviet delegation  Andrei Gromyko  in the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Those who stage-managed that unprecedented act are overtly aiming to generate anti-Soviet hysteria and hence to disrupt the political dialogue which has been maintained with so much difficulty and which is so vital  particularly at the present time. That is a course of abandoning reason and good will and of turning towards political and military provocation and aggression.107.	The people of the German Democratic Republic lives at the dividing line between the world's two largest military alliances  those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty. It knows from its own painful historical experience what war means and is therefore committed to making maximum efforts to prevent the outbreak of another war. In this effort our people shares what are no doubt the hopes and aspirations of all peoples no matter in which geographical region they live.108.	The planned stationing of new United States medium-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe runs directly counter to the common desire for lasting security. Most of those weapons are to be deployed in our immediate neighbourhood  on territory where a host of nuclear weapons is already deployed  more densely than anywhere else in the world. Those new American missiles will not afford more security; on the contrary  they will add considerably to the danger of nuclear war. Obviously their only purpose is to provide those who possess them with a first-strike capability enabling them to ""decapitate"" the Soviet Union in a surprise attack.109.	These are elements of a strategy aimed at military superiority  as a result of which the world is already cursed with multiple overkill capacity. Let me be quite clear: super armament and confrontation  poisoning the international climate and fomenting regional conflicts in all parts of the world constitute a blueprint for direct and all-out preparation for war  a war which in our time would be a nuclear one from the very outset and would engulf the entire world.110.	The socialist States do not want to join in that course and they certainly will not do so. They are making every effort to make reason and good will prevail again in relations among nations. They are and remain prepared to seek a peaceful synthesis of the legitimate interests of all sides through patient negotiations. This holds true for all problems  but most specifically for the overriding concern of preventing a nuclear world war.111.	In the Prague Declaration and the Moscow joint statement of the leaders of socialist countries  the Warsaw Treaty States have set out a realistic solution based on the principle of equality and equal security. That principle also underlies the Soviet Union's proposals to negotiate with the United States at Geneva an agreed parity of nuclear potentials in Europe  with regard both to delivery vehicles and to warheads. Provided that the United States forgoes the deployment of new missiles in Europe  the Soviet Union would be ready to reduce the number of its missiles stationed in the European part of its territory to the level of the British and French missiles and to scrap its missiles covered by the reduction.112.	Success at the Geneva talks  which are now in their decisive phase  would be important for global peace and security. This requires  however  that both sides contribute their share. Thus far  only the Soviet Union has shown  by its unilateral moves  that it seeks results at Geneva which would strengthen peace. Looking at the other side  one cannot but gain the impression that it needs those negotiations only as an alibi for its resolve to deploy its missiles in Western Europe in any event and as quickly as possible.113.	In this situation  the recent statement by Yuri Andropov  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  is an urgent appeal to all those who bear political responsibility to let realism  reason and restraint prevail for the sake of humanity's survival.114.	It is the mandate of the United Nations to make every effort to save humankind from the scourge of war. That obligation  formulated in 1945  has never been more relevant than today. Meeting it requires vigorous action now.115.	The results of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries are evidence of the will of those countries to devote their energies to the attainment of these fundamental objectives. We highly value the responsible efforts of India  and notably those of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi  to ensure the continuation and encouragement of political dialogue  also and especially in the face of the present- day tense international situation.116.	It is encouraging as well that more and more people  regardless of political and ideological differences  are insisting on their right to peace as the elementary human right. We are confident that the forces of peace and reason will prevail over the forces of war  and those who are playing with fire and resorting to dangerous provocations against the Soviet Union and other socialist States  thereby seeking to plunge the world into another serious crisis  cannot change this certainty.117.	Whatever the purpose of the aircraft provocation in the Far East  it is a fact that it was with reference to and reportedly ""under the impression"" of this event that the United States Senate approved the requested record military budget. There has even been a demand by Senators to break off the disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union. People ask themselves with concern: how can it be that disarmament  in which all peoples are interested for the sake of their survival  should be made an element of a policy of sanctions and blackmail? The pattern and the circumstances of that provocation are certainly not new. World public opinion remembers only too well the pretexts fabricated to launch the First World War and the Second World War  as well as numerous conflicts in the post-war era.118.	What is really diabolical is the laying of the blame for the aggravation of the international situation on the Soviet Union and the intention to furnish ""fresh proof"" that it embodies the ""focus of evil"" in the world. Acting in that way gambles recklessly with the destiny of mankind.119.	The State that I represent here lives up to its people's profound commitment to make every effort to ensure that never again will a war emanate from German soil. Guided by this bequest of the 50 million dead of the last world war and of the fighters against Nazi barbarism  the Communist parties on German soil have urged all European working class parties  trade unions and youth organizationsâindeed all people on the continent desiring a peaceful lifeâto engage in joint action to safeguard peace.120.	Like the United Nations  the German Democratic Republic emerged from the anti-fascist liberation struggle of the peoples. That moulded and continues to mould its consistent and reliable policy at home and abroad. Hence  it has been submitting proposals to ban neo-fascist developments and to outlaw fascist regimes in the world. Thus  the German Democratic Republic has stood and stands for the elimination of the danger of nuclear war  in particular of the non-first-use of nuclear weapons  and for the prohibition of the nuclear neutron weapon and of chemical weapons.121.	The German Democratic Republic has always stood at the side of the peoples struggling for independence and self-determination and against aggression  oppression  racism and apartheid. It is an active supporter of the world Organization's efforts to settle international conflicts peacefully and in the peoples' interests and to develop international economic relations that are beneficial to all States.122.	At its thirty-eighth session  the General Assembly has the important task of contributing towards saving humanity from the danger of nuclear war  towards the speediest possible cessation of the arms race and towards the transition to disarmament. This presupposes that all have the political will and are prepared to scale down political and military confrontation  that no attempts are made to obtain security for oneself at the expense of the legitimate security interests of others  that there is an awareness of what is realistically feasible and that mutual agreements are strictly observed. That is what we understand by negotiating ""in good faith""  also in the difficult area of arms limitation and disarmament.123.	The German Democratic Republic is for pledges by all nuclear-weapon States to forgo the first use of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union's unilateral undertaking to that effect must now be matched by moves of the other nuclear-weapon Powers. The German Democratic Republic advocates an immediate freeze on all nuclear-weapon stockpiles and the non-deployment of new nuclear weapons either in Europe or elsewhere. It favours a moratorium on all nuclear-weapon tests  binding on all countries orâif that cannot be achieved at onceâonly on the Soviet Union and the United States. It also supports an agreement on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  an end to the qualitative arms race and  in particular  a ban on the production of neutron weapons.124.	Together with its allies  the German Democratic Republic advocates a ban on stationing weapons of any kind in outer space and on the use of force in outer space and from outer space against the earth. The German Democratic Republic supports the pertinent proposal submitted by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.125.	The work undertaken with a view to concluding a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations and to preparing an international convention on the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons should be pursued at a quicker pace.126.	The creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones is a matter of great importance. The German Democratic Republic at once endorsed the Swedish proposal for the establishment of a zone free of battlefield nuclear weapons on both sides of the dividing line between the Warsaw Treaty and NATO areas and has offered to make its entire territory available for inclusion in such a zone  provided that this zone is constituted in accordance with the principle of equality and equal security. Although that offer has met with a negative response from the Western countries so far  the proposal remains topical.127.	We also welcome all efforts aimed at establishing the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. If peace and security in that region are to be strengthened  the conference intended to be held for this purpose must not be postponed still further.128.	We should like to stress the significance of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959  which has proved to be a reliable basis for maintaining the demilitarized and denuclearised status of the South Pole region.129.	A few weeks ago the Madrid follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe came to an end. Its results open up prospects of a fresh impetus for detente and peaceful coexistence. This can happen  however  only if all the areas of the Conference's process equally guide States in their dealings with one another. The experience of Helsinki  Belgrade and Madrid tells us that results can be achieved only in a spirit of harmony. This also remains the prerequisite for implementing the Madrid agreements.130.	With its policy of seeking dialogue and promoting co-operation  the German Democratic Republic has played no small part in preventing the spirit of cold war from entirely arresting the momentum of detente. By engaging in normal  mutually beneficial co-operation at the bilateral level in the political  economic and cultural fields  the German Democratic Republic endeavours to help reduce international tensions.131.	Conscious of its particular responsibility for international peace and security that arises from both its history and its geopolitical situation  the German Democratic Republic conducts relations with the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of the generally recognized norms of international law and the mutual obligations agreed with that country. We think it will be necessary in the future also that agreements such as the system of European East-West treaties and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin  which have proved useful and beneficial and have generated confidence in international relations  be carefully guarded.132.	Any careless handling  let alone any non-observance  of these obligations  any insistence on unrealistic conceptions  would not only affect bilateral relations but also aggravate international tensions and  in the end  even erode peace on our continent.133.	The States Members of the United Nations note with concern how  in the wake of the arms build-up policy  international conflicts are expanding  sparing no region of our globe.134.	In Europe  almost 40 years after the defeat of Hitlerite fascism  those agreements of the anti-Hitler coalition  which have guaranteed the peaceful development of this continent and are also a basic element of the Helsinki Final Act ' were recently negated once again at Vienna in a statement by a Washington politician.135.	I want to put it as clearly as possible: it is not by accident that such attacks on the European post-war order are made by those forces which seek to begin the deployment of their missiles on European soil in the near future.136.	In Central America a crusade has been launched against social progress. Nicaragua has to defend itself against massive attacks on her sovereignty and independence; the people of El Salvador has to resort to the use of arms to fight for its rights. The German Democratic Republic reaffirms its solidarity with the peoples of that region. It supports such approaches to a political settlement of the crisis in the area as are embodied  for example  in the activities and initiatives of the States of the Contadora Group.137.	As for the conflict in the South Atlantic  the German Democratic Republic understands the growing concern of the Latin American States and peoples and advocates a settlement on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations and the Political Declaration of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi 138.	The German Democratic Republic emphatically demands that the Namibian people  led by the South West Africa People's Organization  be granted independence without further delay. It is imperatively necessary to implement the decisions adopted at the Paris Conference on Namibia and to enhance the responsibility of the United Nations for the settlement of the question of Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).139.	It is urgently necessary to settle the Middle East conflict  the most lengthy and dangerous conflict of all. This requires that the Palestinian people be enabled to exercise its inalienable rights  moulding its right to establish an independent State of its own. The decisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly point the way.140.	The German Democratic Republic supports the proposal  reaffirmed by the recent International Conference on the Question of Palestine  that the Middle East question be settled within the framework of an international conference with the participation of all interested sides  including the PLO. It demands Israel's immediate withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967. The German Democratic Republic strongly condemns the imperialist policy of force against Lebanon as well as the preparations for aggression against Syria  accompanied by a campaign against the PLO and other patriotic Arab forces.141.	We follow with sympathy the efforts being made by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the People's Republic of Kampuchea to ensure their sovereignty and security. This goes both for the current endeavours to find a political solution concerning the situation around Afghanistan and for the constructive decisions taken at the Summit Conference of the States of Indochina last February.142.	The German Democratic Republic supports the foreign policy activities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea designed to preserve peace on the Korean peninsula and the struggle to ensure the withdrawal of the United States troops from South Korea and for the peaceful  democratic unification of Korea without outside interference.143.	We note with great concern that more and more financial and material resources are being channelled into war preparations and are thus withheld from economic and social development. The current international economic and financial crisis is essentially due to the policy of an all-out arms drive. How can a State be proud of having spent some $222 billion on its armament in 1982? How can a State propose to spend over $367 billion on arms programmes in 1986 when  at the same time  tens of millions are jobless in the capitalist industrial States and when according to an FAO report 120 million people in the world are threatened with death from starvation? According to UNICEF data  every day more than 40 000 children die of hunger and disease. Is it not preposterous that  as the Secretary-General noted  at present as much money is spent on military purposes in 18 days as is spent in a whole year on all government assistance to developing countries?144.	A mere tenth of the amount currently going into armament world-wide would suffice to eradicate illiteracy and wage a successful war against illness  hunger and food shortages. The situation could be remedied by the sum representing the 10 per cent reduction in the annual arms budgets of the permanent members of the Security Council recommended by the Soviet Union.145.	At the current session measures should be agreed upon against the imposition of trade restrictions  blockades and other internationally illegal sanctions. This could help to re-establish confidence in international economic relations and to normalize international trade. Moreover  such a step would create the atmosphere needed for the earliest possible convocation of global negotiations on key economic problems  in accordance with the relevant decisions which the General Assembly has adopted by consents. 146.	Equal rights  respect for sovereignty  non-discrimination  mutual benefit and non-interference in internal affairs are the principles that guide the German Democratic Republic  in accordance with the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  in its relations with the developing countries. Last year my country provided extensive assistance to developing countries and national liberation movements. Indeed  it has continuously carried on its support and even increased it despite the fact that the world economic situation has become much more complicated.147.	For the future of mankind it is essential for the peoples to cope with the many challenges now facing them. These include the mastery of the scientific and technological revolution  the elimination of want and misery  the eradication of hunger and disease  the protection and sensible management of the environment  multiplication of the world's riches for the peoples' benefit and the realization of the right to work and to a life worthy of a human being. All these problems can be solved. Mankind has the experience  the knowledge  and the strength to do so. What it needs is peace. "
"39",1844,"DEU",38,1983,"28.	 I wish first of all  Sir  to take this opportunity to convey to you the congratulations of the Federal Republic of Germany on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. You are a person with exceptional qualities and wide experience  among other things in the work of the United Nations  as well as the representative of a country and a continent with which friendly relations are for us traditional.29.	I wish also to extend my country's thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Hollai  the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary  whose presidency of the thirty-seventh session bore the stamp of commitment and balance.30.	I am grateful to the Secretary-General and his staff for their dedicated work in the past year in the service of the Organization and in the cause of world peace.31.	On behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany  I extend a warm welcome to Saint Christopher and Nevis as the newest Member of the United Nations.32.	Ten years ago the Federal Republic of Germany became a Member of the United Nations. On that occasion  speaking from this rostrum  our then Foreign Minister  Waiter Scheel  said:""Peace takes first place. The times have gone when the family of nations allowed a single State or a political group to upset the coexistence of the whole family through the use of force.""In our time there is no longer any room for the law of the jungle.'"" Today those words ring more true than ever. All Members of the United Nations have solemnly undertaken not to use force of any kind. Yet what do we see around us? Afghanistan  Cambodia  South-West Asia  the Middle East  Chad  southern Africa  Central America and other regions of the world are scenes of ghastly wars and civil strife.33.	This year the world will have spent the staggering sum of $800 billion on arms. How ruthlessly force is resorted to is shown by the shooting down of a South Korean passenger aircraft by a Soviet military aircraft. That must never happen again. I appeal to all nations to participate in the efforts of ICAO to work out rules that will make a repetition of such a tragedy impossible.34.	The peoples of the earth long for peace and the absence of force  and they look to the United Nations in the hope that the Organization will accomplish its most noble task  which is to promote world peace. It was the desire to participate in this global task of fostering peace that motivated my country in joining the United Nations. We reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations and we shall do all we can to help it accomplish its task of safeguarding peace.35.	We laid the foundations of our policy for peace in the 1950s when we joined the European Community and the Western alliance.36.	The treaty policy with our neighbours in the East and with the German Democratic Republic followed. With our accession to the United Nations we assumed our full responsibility within the community of nations.37.	In 1973  the year of our accession  the efforts to achieve the goals of detente and co-operation between East and West were in full swing. No doubt all Members of the United Nations then hoped that the international community would from then on be able to concentrate its political energies and economic resources more and more on the three great global tasks of mankind: disarmament  the elimination of hunger and want  and protection of the natural environment.38.	This year 1972 was that of the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  and 1975 saw the commencement of the North-South dialogue. But hopes for the progressive  constructive development of East-West relations were dashed. Detente and co-operation have suffered severe setbacks since the end of the 1970s through the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  the events in Poland and the destabilizing arms build-up by the Soviet Union.39.	Today once more international discussion focuses on East-West tensions rather than on comprehensive North-South co-operation in pursuit of development in the third world. Once again the East-West confrontation is preventing the United Nations from doing its job of f serving world peace.40.	Yet we must not give up. Proceeding on the basis of its membership in the European Community and in the Western alliance  the Federal Republic of Germany will continue to work for the maintenance of peace in Europe. The European Community  the core of which is Franco-German friendship  is an organization ofEuropean democracies which have pooled their energies to shape their future together  as equals  in peace and freedom.41.	Referring to the goals of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's defence alliance  the heads of State and Government declared at Bonn on 10 June 1982: ""Our purpose is to prevent war and  while safeguarding democracy  to build the foundations of lasting peace. None of our weapons will ever be used in response to attack.""42.	Europe must be a continent of peace  must become a force for the peace of the whole world.43.	We shall continue to pursue detente and co-operation with our neighbours in the East. We shall continue to do everything in our power to help build a world order of peace in which nations  conscious of their interdependence  will work together as partners and human rights  the civil and political just as much as the economic  social and cultural rights  will be enjoyed by all.44.	At this moment the eyes of the whole world are on Geneva  the venue of the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic arms reduction and intermediate-range nuclear forces.45.	My Government welcomes the new American proposals for the intermediate-range negotiations which President Reagan outlined in his address to the Assembly on 26 September. We hope they will make possible at least an interim result in those negotiations before the end of the year. The United States has proposed the total renunciation of all American and Soviet land-based intermediate-range missiles. That remains our goal. Only such a result could render superfluous the deployment of Western missiles scheduled for the end of 1983. The key to that lies in Moscow. The Government and citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany and all nations of Europe and Asia long for nothing more ardently than the attainment of that goal.46.	We do not want to be constantly exposed to the threat of Soviet intermediate-range missiles. We shall not accept a Soviet monopoly of land-based missiles. As the Soviet Union does not at present seem willing to forgo that weapons system completely  we pin our hope on an interim agreement that would limit Soviet and United States missiles of this type to the lowest possible number.47.	The new Western proposals have opened up that possibility. They take account of Soviet interests and considerations. I appeal to the Soviet Union not to let the opportunity to achieve a concrete result pass. I appeal to the Soviet Union not to block the intermediate-range nuclear forces negotiations any longer by insisting that the British and French systems be included.48.	The Soviet Union should take careful note of what has been said by President Mitterrand and the British Foreign Secretary and also the Chinese Foreign Minister about taking into account and limiting strategic systems in terms of arms control policy.49.	We must view these disarmament negotiations at Geneva in the overall context of East-West relations. The fact that today the West and East are engaged in such intensive and comprehensive negotiations on confidence- building  arms control and disarmament is encouraging. We have never doubted that the military aspects of security pose the most difficult problems in the detente process  but the settlement of these issues is indispensable for real detente and for the development of a durable peace order in Europe.50.	Chancellor Kohl has reaffirmed that we recognize the Soviet Union's need for security in the light of history. We want for ourselves no more  but also no less  than equal recognition of our own security interests.51.	The process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe offers one of the most promising opportunities for resolving or reducing East-West problems through mutual understanding and compromise and for carrying out common tasks through co-operation. That Conference has linked human rights and human contacts with the process of detente and economic cooperation. It has become a matter which concerns not only governments but peoples as well. We made every effort to ensure that the follow-up meeting at Madrid took place in spite of critical international developments and that it was assiduously continued and eventually concluded at the ministerial level.52.	The result of that meeting shows our endeavours to have been worth while. The net woven by the Final Act of Helsinki2 has held up under many heavy strains. Now the Concluding Document of the Madrid meeting has brought important progress. It makes allowance for the interests of the people and for questions of co-operation  security and confidence-building. Now the aim must be to translate these results into practice and to let the positive impulses generated at Madrid give impetus to the disarmament negotiations also.53.	The Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe due to begin at Stockholm on 17 January 1984 will for the first time open the whole of Europe  from the Atlantic to the Urals  to arms control. Military stability in the field of conventional forces in Europe can become a reality only if confidence-building measures and arms control encompass all European territory. Thus that Conference is a necessary complement to the Vienna negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions  which cover only central Europe.54.	In the first phase of negotiations the Conference will seek agreement on verifiable confidence-building measures to reduce the danger of a conventional surprise attack in Europe. A further phase of the Conference could lead on to disarmament negotiations proper. The sooner stability in the conventional sphere is established at the lowest possible level of forces  the sooner it will become possible also to reduce nuclear capabilities in Europe step by step on the basis of agreements. We must remain constantly aware of this broad perspective. Disarmament directed towards the establishment of equilibrium is the aim of German peace policy. We want to achieve peace with ever fewer weapons.55.	Speaking on behalf of the new German Government formed after the March elections  Chancellor Kohl said that we would consistently pursue the policy of understanding  detente and co-operation with our Eastern neighbours on the basis of the treaties concluded in the seventies. That policy is designed for the long term. We shall continue our efforts to infuse those treaties with life.56.	We are convinced that positive developments in the political and economic relations between West and East can facilitate the settlement of the difficult security issues. Economic co-operation brings stability to East-West relations. We want neither a trade war nor any misuse of economic relations as a disciplinary instrument. That applies in relation to all countries.57.	We want to expand consistently our relations with the Soviet Union in the long term and improve their quality. We are conscious of the importance of German- Soviet relations for East-West relations. But this policy cannot be a one-way street. Chancellor Kohl said in his policy statement on 5 May 1983 that we judge the will for co-operation of the Soviet Union's leaders by the extent to which they actually help to reduce and eliminate all impediments.58.	We wish to keep on developing our relations with our other Eastern neighbours also. Europe does not stop at the Elbe. Europe has a common history and a common future. All of us in Europe can gain from progress in detente and in co-operation  but we can all only lose through confrontation.59.	Constructive development in East-West relations is greatly influenced by the relationship between the two German States. The Germans in West and East have a common responsibility towards peace in Europe  and the Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic must constantly be aware of that responsibility. We share the conviction that Germany must never again be a source of war but that it should rather generate impulses for peace.60.	The treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic laid the foundation for the development of comprehensive cooperation. We Germans in West and East must have the ambition not to be outdone by anyone else when it comes to putting into practice the Final Act of Helsinki and the declaration of Madrid. A peaceful and stable situation in and around Berlin is crucial both for German-German relations and for East-West relations as a whole.61.	Co-operation between the two German States strengthens the cohesion of the nation. Our aim is to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will regain its unity through free self-determination. Our aim is to work for a peace order in the whole of Europe that is characterized by trust and comprehensive cooperation.62.	All countries concerned must make their contribution to detente and co-operation between West and East. This means the following. The political dialogue between West and East must not stop; indeed it must be intensified precisely when the going is rough  and this applies in particular to the dialogue between the two super-Powers. My Government regrets that Foreign Minister Gromyko is not attending this session of the General Assembly. We strongly advocate a summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Andropov and welcome the readiness of the United States to attend such a meeting.63.	Co-operation in all spheres consolidates peace. Disarmament negotiations cannot bear fruit in a climate of confrontation  nor can they be conducted in a vacuum. They need to have a place in the framework of constructive East-West relations. This calls for a willingness to see and appreciate the other side's interests  needs  fears and problems. Presenting each other as demons poisons the international atmosphere. Reason  clear-headedness and cool calculation are indispensable.64.	All nations  in the West and in the East  must adhere strictly to the principle of the renunciation of force  as they have promised in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  to the extent that they are signatories. This includes the exercise of moderation in the pursuit of one's own interests. Referring to the further development of the concept of the renunciation of force  Chancellor Kohl  during his visit to Moscow on 4 July 1983  said that a further binding renewal of the prohibition of the use of force ""can help improve the international situation if it actually prevents the threat of force and stops it where it is still being used"" 65.	We do not want war  either a nuclear or a conventional one. President Reagan is right; a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.66.	All countries must contribute to arms control and disarmament directed towards the establishment of an equilibrium  and all countries must be willing to help establish tangible confidence-building measures. Transparency and verifiability must be translated into concrete measures.67.	All nations  in the West and in the East  must discharge the obligation to keep the East-West confrontation out of the third world. There is no longer any future in hegemony or in spheres of influence  either in Europe or elsewhere in the world. We must all contribute to a peaceful settlement of the conflicts in Asia  Africa and Latin America. Economic development and the elimination of hunger and want in the third world brook no further delay. It is not the export of weapons but development co-operation that is urgently needed. Only if disarmament produces a stable equilibrium between East and West at the lowest possible level of armaments will East and West be able to make the necessary contribution to the global tasks of the future: the development of the third world and the preservation of the natural basis of life on our planet. My country is conscious of its responsibility concerning peace  development and environmental protection. We are playing our part in the efforts to accomplish these tasks.68.	The principles guiding our co-operation with third world countries are clear: we respect the right of all nations to independence and self-determination; we support genuine non-alignment  which we see as a stabilizing element of international relations; we plead the cause of the renunciation of force world-wide and support the peaceful settlement of conflicts; we are helping to eliminate hunger and want everywhere in the world; and we are striving for progress in the global exercise of human rights  since without this nations will find no lasting peace  internally or in their external relations.69.	At its thirty-eighth session the General Assembly will be debating a number of crises. The most urgent problem to be solved in safeguarding world peace is unchanged: that of a comprehensive and equitable peace settlement in the Middle East. In Lebanon the bloodshed and the suffering of the civilian population must be ended without delay and the way to national reconciliation reopened. Reconciliation is essential for the independence  sovereignty and unity of Lebanon. The peace process in the wider Israeli-Arab Middle East conflict must be resumed. The right of self-determination of the Palestinian people must be recognized  as must the right of all nations in the region  including Israel  to live within secure and recognized boundaries.70.	We appeal to Iraq and Iran to stop the war in the Gulf that has claimed so many lives on both sides.71.	The Cyprus question exemplifies attempts by the United Nations to help resolve conflicts by peaceful means. My Government supports the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. It supports all efforts by the Secretary-General to ensure the regular pursuit of intercommunal talks.72.	The continuing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia place a particularly heavy strain on international relations. The Soviet Union and Viet Nam must cease their resistance to the demand of the entire world that they withdraw their forces. Concerning the Cambodian question  we support the recent appeal by the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in all respects. Afghanistan is a touchstone of Soviet will do to recognize the independence of third world nations  to respect their desire for non-alignment and not to seek a position of dominance.73.	The peaceful settlement of the conflicts in the Horn of Africa  Western Sahara and southern Africa is urgently needed. International efforts to secure Namibia's independence must at long last be brought to a successful conclusion on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). As a member of the Western contact group  the Federal Republic of Germany has been playing an active part in these efforts for a number of years and will not relax its efforts. We welcome the Secretary-General's initiative in this respect and promise him our full support. In the Republic of South Africa  the policy of apartheid  which is inimical to the very notion of human rights  must at long last be ended.74.	It is only by peaceful means that the political  economic and social conflicts currently convulsing Central America can be resolved. Here too we are ready to help in so far as we can to bring stability to that region. We see a possibility for regional co-operation between the European Community and the nations of that region. We strongly support the peace initiative of the Contadora Group.75.	The worsening conflicts in Asia  Africa and Latin America are accompanied by an increasing arms build-up in those parts of the world. Military spending in the third world has quadrupled over the past 20 years and today accounts for one quarter of the global military expenditure. Thus arms control and disarmament are becoming increasingly urgent tasks for many regions of the third world also. Confidence-building measures are indispensable for the third world too. An international symposium held in the Federal Republic of Germany in the spring called for such measures in order to defuse tensions in the third world. Within the Disarmament Commission our work on the list of guidelines for confidence-building measures continues.76.	Regional co-operation is an effective and promising concept for the promotion of peace and stability in the world. My Government sees tit as the best way of safeguarding and strengthening the political and economic independence of the developing countries. The European Community is a model for a regional grouping in which all members have equal rights. It has long been a factor of stability in Europe and in the world. Through cooperation agreements with regional groupings in the third world it has created a model for future co-operation between industrial and developing countries. The Lom6 Convention which links the European Community with African  Caribbean and Pacific States  and the successful co-operation between the European Community and ASEAN testify to this.77.	According to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  international co-operation should also serve to ensure the protection of human rights. Innocent people are still being held  tortured and murdered in prisons. Individuals are still the object of discrimination merely on account of their colour or their religion. Many millions of people  principally in the third world  are still having to live in conditions of poverty that are unworthy of the human race. These pictures of violence  injustice and misery illustrate the challenge. They show how much still has to be done to make human rights a reality.78.	The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights must not remain mere declarations. They must become a reality. We support the proposal for the appointment of a high commissioner for human rights. We call upon the family of nations  conscious of the good done by the European Court of Human Rights  to agree on the institution of a court of human rights of the United Nations. We hope that the next session of the General Assembly  acting on the basis of the report submitted by the Commission on Human Rights  will approve our proposed optional protocol for die abolition of capital punishment. A convention affording protection against torture is urgently needed.79.	Among the important creative tasks of the United Nations in the Held of law is that of formulating the right to development. We support the current work of the Commission ca Human Rights in this field.80.	The refugee situation is one of the most pressing problems of our time. It demonstrates how closely human rights are tied up with peace. Millions of refugees mean not only human misery a million times over. This trend endangers the political and economic stability of the overburdened receiving countries and is a threat to peace.81.	As the Secretary-General explained in his report on the work of the Organization the refugee problem can only be resolved if the underlying political causes are removed. It was  mark of progress when  at the initiative of my country  the General Assembly included in the agenda of its thirty-fifth session an item concerning international preventive measures to avoid new flows of refugees. We must now develop a system of concrete measures so that the United Nations can take timely action to prevent new flows.82.	The economic and social development of the third world is only possible if world peace is safeguarded. Development needs peace  but  conversely  peace needs development. For the sake of world peace all energy must be devoted to the task of economic development in the third world. That is also a vital self-interest of the industrialized countries. The world economy is gradually overcoming the worst recession since the thirties. Nowhere has that recession had such devastating consequences as in the third world. In the African countries with low incomes  the situation of many people has become desperate. And even in Latin America  per capita incomes have dropped sharply in the past two years.83. The development process now needs to be started up again and accelerated everywhere in the third world. The international community as a whole must help. The industrialized countries of the East  too  must finally meet their responsibilities. Belief in the success of the development process needs to be revitalized. 86. How great the difficulties are is reflected in the discussions at the annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF in Washington. But neither can we afford to resign ourselves to the situation  nor would such resignation be justified. The incipient upswing in the industrialized countries must be harnessed to the needs of the third world. Energy prices have become more stable. Interest rates  though still high  are distinctly below the 1981/82 peak. Every per cent less in Eurodollar interest rates saves the developing countries over two billion dollars in interest payments a year. World trade is showing signs of picking up again. Rising commodity prices mean bigger export earnings for many developing countries. The industrial democracies must maintain their economic growth without rekindling inflation. This still cannot be done without reducing budget deficits. One per cent or less growth in the industrialized countries can be instrumental in determining the success or failure of the developing countries' own efforts.87.	This places an additional responsibility on the industrialized countries to ensure lasting  non-inflationary growth. Widespread North-South co-operation must afford direct support to the development process. The international flow of capital to the developing countries must now scrupulously be maintained and extended. Development requiresâand this applies at any timeâan inflow of capital and foreign exchange. To the least developed countries  official development aid is crucial. In recent years this aid has accounted for 84 per cent of capital inflows.88.	In the case of the advanced developing countries  on the other hand  the problem of easing the external debt is the prime concern. With a volume of some 700 billion dollars and an annual interest burden amounting to 50 billion dollars  the debt of the developing countries has assumed dramatic proportions. Co-operation between IMF and development and commercial banks  as well as between the governments of debtor and creditor countries  must be intensified. The commercial banks must be ready to provide even more loans. The World Bank  IMF and the regional development banks must make their contribution  and to do so they must receive the necessary funds from their member countries. The ability of these proven institutions to function must be preserved if the basic conditions for the economic recovery of the third world and of the world as a whole are not to be placed in jeopardy.89.	Rescheduling must allow for special individual circumstances and take place within the scope of sensible stabilization programmes. More effective measures are needed to counter protectionism. Commodity markets and the earnings from commodity exports must be stabilized. By means of such measures  coupled with resolute adjustment policies on the part of the developing countries  the present crisis can be overcome and the development process consolidated and energetically continued.90.	To ensure the success of development efforts  the industrial countries must not only keep their markets open to exports from developing countries  but widen them. Protectionist policies in relation to the developing countries are tantamount to refusing development. East-South trade must also be intensified. The industrialized state- trading nations of Eastern Europe account for only four per cent of exports from developing countries  whereas the market economy industrial countries absorb 67 per cent. Thus  the Western industrialized countries import more than sixteen times as much from the developing countries as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance countries  although they have only about twice their population. CMEA's economic planning is therefore  obviously  of a protectionist character.91.	It is time the East European industrial countries created wider possibilities for imports from developing countries. Only thus will they meet their responsibility towards the third world. Helping those countries in their development is a dictate of peace and  especially in relation to the poorest nations  an expression of global solidarity.92.	Yet it can never be more than an aid towards self- help. The key to successful development lies ultimately in the economic and social policies of the third world nations themselves. Here it will be important to draw on the experience of three development decades.93.	The economic co-operation of the Federal Republic of Germany is concentrated on four main areas: rural development; the development of conventional and renewable sources of energy; education  particularly vocational and primary education; and environmental protection. 94.	We attach special importance to support for UNFPA. It is now widely recognized that too rapid a population growth can be too great a burden on the development process; it can drag it down and stifle it. Official development aid must be complemented by private direct investment in the third world and by cooperation between companies in the developed and industrialized countries. In the third world  too  private in vestment must become one of the hubs of growth.95.	The mutual desire of North and South to re-establish stable growth and development calls for a continuous dialogue between North and South at all levels. The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  at Belgrade  proved disappointing in some ways  yet the many resolutions adopted indicate that North and South place their faith in co-operation. That consensus must be the basis for further co-operation. The launching of global negotiations must not be put off any longer. The participants in the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development  at Cancun  came out in favour of them. Now words must be followed by deeds. Global negotiations must be complemented by smaller but  at the same time  representative bodies. The Cancun meeting clearly brought more objectivity into the North- South dialogue. It will continue to require impulsion at the highest political level.96.	Preserving the natural basis of life on an Earth that has become smaller is a task that will be crucial for the future of mankind.97.	In Europe the forests are dying. In other regions of the world the deserts and steppes are spreading; the land is becoming barren. The air is becoming more and more polluted; the ecological balance of lakes and rivers  even of the oceans  is in jeopardy. The ecosystems of tropical regions  too  are particularly sensitive  and many developing countries have suffered environmental damage  which at the same time does great harm to the economy. Therefore  environmental protection must already be an integral part of any development strategy.98.	Long-term damage resulting from the indifferent- worse  irresponsibleâuse of natural resources spells danger for the existence of the whole of mankind.99.	Global environmental problems can be solved only through close international co-operation. Protection of the environment is a major objective of the Federal Republic of Germany  both at home and in other parts of the world. We are co-operating for the protection of the environment with other industrial countries in the European Community  the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Economic Commission for Europe. In 1984 a conference is to be held at Munich at which all nations of Western and Eastern Europe  as well as the United States and Canadaâthat is  all members of the Commissionâwill tackle the problems connected with dying forests and the ecosystems of national and international waters.100.	Part of our bilateral development co-operation is to help the third world countries solve their environmental problems. Our aim is to bring all development projects into harmony with their respective environments.101.	In regard to the environmental protection programme of the United Nations it is important to note the following.102.	There must be no lasting North-South gap in terms of environmental protection.103.	Environmental pollution must not be transferred to the third world.104.	Environmental protection and economic co-operation must be linked in such a way that ecological aspects are always taken into account when implementing development projects.105.	A pool of experts must be available to third world countries  which can request their assistance through UNEP in the planning  implementation and evaluation of environmental projects.106.	The training and advisory services available to nations of the third world must be expanded to cover environmental aspects. This applies in particular to food and water supply problems.107.	The community of nations must use the world's natural resources rationally and in a manner compatible with the environment.108.	We want all men to be able to live in a world without fear  without force  without want. We realize that in order to build such a world we require a strong world organization. Hence we must all  together  give the United Nations that strength.109.	We say to the Secretary-General: ""We stand by your side. We support your efforts to make the United Nations the focal point of global co-operation through which conflicts can be resolved by peaceful means and the great common tasks accomplished.""110.	The world is at the crossroads. It must decide between international anarchy  confrontation and the use of force  and co-operation between equals for the sake of peace  freedom and progress.111.	Only if we all act in accordance with the principles of the Charter  only if the right to the self-determination of nations and human rights are realized everywhere  only if the renunciation of force  disarmament  development and protection of the natural environment are seen as our common task  will mankind survive.  Mr. President  thank you very much for your kind words of welcome. For the first time since the Federal Republic of Germany became a Member of the United Nations its President has the great privilege of addressing this world forum.3.	Ten years ago the Federal Republic of Germany became a Member of the United Nations. My visit today is a mark of the high esteem which the United Nations enjoys in the Federal Republic of Germany. At the same time it underscores a great importance which my country attaches to close co-operation with the United Nations in the pursuit of peace and justice.4.	From the very outset the goal of the Federal Republic of Germany has been peace. This policy is an expression of our political conviction  which stems from the bitter experience of two world wars in one century.5.	This policy also has its roots in the tradition of German philosophers and thinkers who saw peace as the basis for the well-being of every nation. Two hundred years ago one of the great German philosophers  Immanuel Kant of Koenigsberg  described the preconditions for a world order in a treatise which reflects his deep insight into man's nature. The citizen of the world  as Kant called him  is the starting point and the goal  as it were  the subject and the object of politics and law. Kant saw a close link between a State's internal constitution and its foreign policy. A State's internal constitution  its legal system  is also bound to affect its conduct in relation to others. By the same token  injustice in matters of foreign policy poses a serious threat to the State's internal structure.6.	Throughout history mankind has longed for and dreamed of peace and justice  but to this day the reality is  unfortunately  different. Throughout the centuries  right down to the present day  the world has been torn by war and conflict. Today  the United Nations is the great hope of mankind. Imperfect though it may be  there is no alternative to the United Nations. My country has learnt from the terrible experience of two world wars. We have chosen the path of reconciliation and mutual understanding.7.	Today  the Federal Republic of Germany is a member of the European Community. The enemies of yesterday have become the friends and partners of today. The European Community is a unique example of what common ideals and common aims can achieve for the benefit of more than 300 million Europeans and all the 62 third world countries that are linked with us within the framework of the Lome Convention.8.	The Federal Republic of Germany is also a member of the Atlantic alliance which links Western Europe with the United States and Canada. This community safeguards peace in our part of the world  which so often in the past has been the battlefield of conflicting power interests. The Atlantic alliance differs from the military pacts of former times by virtue of its defensive character and the identity of shared values  such as peace  equality  democracy and respect for the rights of the individual.9.	For over 30 years we have owed peace and security in Europe to this alliance. Peace in Europe  may I add  is not an exclusively European affair. The state of peace we Europeans have been able to enjoy for more than three decades has also placed us in a position to develop and extend our economic relations with the nations of the third world  with the objective of promoting the economic and social development of those countries for the sake of their citizens.10.	The treaties which the Federal Republic of Germany has concluded with its Eastern neighbours have helped to reduce tensions in Europe and opened the way for new forms of co-operation on our continent. The Federal Republic of Germany attaches great importance to continuing dialogue and peaceful co-operation with the countries of Eastern Europe. The 1975 Final Act of Helsinki' and the process it initiated have revitalized the concept and the ideal of human rights  the desire for closer human contacts and the intent to reduce tensions between East and West.11.	The agreements between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic have paved the way for closer co-operation between the two States on German soil. We see that co-operation as an element of and a means of strengthening the bonds between the people in divided Germany. It remains our political aim to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will regain its unity through free self-determination. The boundary which cuts Germany in two  the wall that runs right through our old capital of Berlin  cannot be the final word of history.12.	Disarmament and arms control leading to balance at the lowest possible level are one of the foremost objectives of the German peace policy. At many conference tables our Governments are striving for a reduction of armaments. To achieve this what we need above all is mutual confidence. That is why the Federal Republic of Germany sets so much store by confidence-building measures that lead to greater transparency and control. The first significant results to this end were achieved in the Final Act of Helsinki. The Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  as envisaged in the Concluding Document of the Madrid follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and scheduled for Stockholm early in 1984  will be another important step in this direction. My country hopes and works for real  substantial results in this Held which is so important to us all. Positive results will make peace safer throughout the world. The Federal Republic of Germany  for its part  renounced many years ago the production and possession of nuclear  biological and chemical weapons. I wish others would follow this example.13.	Since the 1950s  close co-operation with the nations of the third world has been one of the pillars of our foreign policy. We believe in solidarity and partnership. We respect the right of every nation to choose its own path into the future and to safeguard its independence. It was from a sense of responsibility that the Federal Republic of Germany took part in the International Meeting on Co-operation and Development at Cancun in October 1981. We had hoped it would produce more than it has so far. One of the reasons for the unsatisfactory progress in this sphere is no doubt the critical world economic situation. However  we shall not relax our efforts in pursuit of a constructive North-South dialogue.14.	My country's accession to the United Nations ten years ago was a question of political logic and a result of our conviction that we would thus be serving the cause of peace. It was also an expression of our willingness to participate in global co-operation and to assume worldwide responsibilities. This is exemplified by our membership in the Security Council in 1977 and 1978.15.	From the very beginning the Federal Republic of Germany conceived its membership of this world Organization as service for human rights. We strongly support efforts to reinforce the protection of human rights and to ensure that they can be exercised. This was the purpose of our proposals for the universal abolition of the death penalty  the adoption of preventive measures against the emergence of new flows of refugees and for a convention against the taking of hostages. The reality which we experience every day is depressing and is a long way from the goals to which we all feel committed. Yet we must not relax our efforts to secure respect for the inalienable rights of every individual  irrespective of his religious or political convictions  his origin or race. Here is an important task for the world Organization. The respect which a State enjoys must depend on the freedom of its citizens and not on the strength of its weapons.16.	There is also a deep gulf between the idea of global peace and the reality of a world full of conflict and violence. In his last annual report as Secretary-General  in 1961  Dag Hammarskjold said:""A failure to gain respect for decisions or actions of the Organization within the terms of the Charter is often called a failure for the Organization. It would seem more correct to regard it as a failure of the world community  through its Member nations and in particular those most directly concerned  to co-operate in order  step by step  to make the Charter a living reality in practical political action as it is already in law.""17.	It is not sufficient for us simply to regret that not much has changed since those words were spoken. You  Mr. Secretary-General  indicated in your report on the work of the Organization to the thirty-seventh session how the instrument of the United Nations can be used more effectively to achieve the goal of collective security. The Federal Republic of Germany supports your proposals.18.	We continue to have an obligation to mankind not to spare any effort to achieve the goals of the Charter of the United Nations  no matter how difficult and toilsome the path may be. The moral leadership of the United Nations and the universal acceptance of its decisions and resolutions will be decisively enhanced the more they are seen as an expression of justice and political wisdom.19.	The United Nations plays a major role in the elaboration of new rules of international conduct and in the further development of international law. International law binds everyone  weak and strong alike. There is a natural tension between sovereignty of the individual States and the concept of universality. Here lies one of the major tasks of the world Organization  namely to seek a balance between the interests of the individual Member State and the well-founded rights of the whole international community.20.	I firmly believe that the course of history will lead away from short-sighted  egocentric power politics. Hegemonic aspirations  the desire to dominate others  have no future in this world. Ever more countries regard themselves as members of a world community with equal rights and equal opportunities. It is politically wise to promote this development with energy and patience.21.	We Germans endeavour to understand other nations  their culture and their history and to establish links with them. This applies not only to North and South America  to which millions of Germans emigrated and with whose new home countries we today have many economic and cultural ties. It also holds true for the Far East  whose languages and cultures have fascinated our writers and philosophers no less than the languages and cultures of the Near and 'Middle East  where the origins of European civilization are to be found. Equally  it holds true for Africa with whom we have close bonds of friendship. Tolerance is the key word for international co-operation and for understanding among nations.22.	Many years of experience in public life and inter-national affairs have convinced me that  as in private life  tolerance is also indispensable in relations between States. Tolerance in the international sphere implies respect for the historical and cultural identity of every nation and its political  economic and social needs. The Federal Republic of Germany  in whose name I have the honour to speak today  is willing  as the Charter says  ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours"".23.	I wish the United Nations endurance and success in its pursuit of peace. The aim of preserving peace and the hopes which mankind places in the world Organization deserve our every effort."
"40",1882,"DJI",38,1983,"ï»¿  It is an immense pleasure for me to congratulate Mr. Illueca  on behalf of my delegation  on his election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the Assembly. His election is a tribute to his country and decisive proof of the profound confidence which his remarkable qualities as a skilled diplomat have inspired in his colleagues. We are convinced that he will be able to exercise the necessary skill in conducting the work of the Assembly  which has the difficult task of resolving at this session the complex issues before it. I should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  whose efforts and devotion assured the success of the preceding session. May I also pay a particular tribute to the Secretary- General for his constant and unceasing efforts to discharge the difficult and sometimes dangerous duties incumbent upon him in safeguarding the lofty ideals on behalf of which the Organization was founded. My delegation is pleased to congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on its independence and most warmly welcomes its admission into the always growing family of the United Nations. We wish Saint Christopher and Nevis every success and we look forward to working in close co-operation with this country.  Every year we meet in the Assembly to review our experiences and exchange views on current international questions in order to try to determine a course of action which could promote international peace and security. We are concerned and uneasy at the extremely unfavorable situation in which the world finds itself because of the escalation of hostilities and the aggravation of tension on practically all continents. We are taking part in the work of the United Nations in the profound conviction that the Organization can and should be the best possible forum for bringing about a climate of tolerance and justice and creating the foundations for a new harmony in international relations. It is in this spirit that the Republic of Djibouti remains firmly devoted to the principles and purposes of the United Nations and that my country joins other States in proclaiming its readiness to co-operate and work in full solidarity for the success of this session. We are convinced that if all countries were more resolutely devoted to the Organization and its Charter  they could make progress towards peace and justice and that co-operation would be based on the principles of independence  equality and human dignity. Thanks to the Almighty  the Republic of Djibouti and its Government  guided by the political experience and wisdom of President Hassan Gouled Aptidon  have adopted a policy aimed at granting to all  within the available resources  the exercise of basic social  economic  political and religious rights  as well as full enjoyment of freedom. The Republic of Djibouti is resolved to create and develop the bases of its economic and social structures  in keeping with the principle of collective self-sufficiency  in order to achieve its national objectives. My Government is endeavoring to resolve the very serious economic difficulties impeding progress towards those aims. The economy of the Republic of Djibouti consists mainly of the service sector. This service economy is entirely dependent on trends in international trade  which are beyond our control. The urgent need to offset the risks of the dependence involved in this kind of economy has prompted the Government of Djibouti to launch a comprehensive programme to revitalize and modernize its tertiary sector and to create a sound foundation for the development of a productive but diversified economy by promoting new sectors  such as industry  agriculture  livestock farming and fisheries. The recent inclusion of Djibouti on the first of least developed countries emphasizes the fact that it is urgently necessary to help Djibouti overcome its economic difficulties. In order to resolve its economic problems the Government of Djibouti has decided to adopt a development strategy with various goals. The development targets of the Republic of Djibouti are set forth in the Economic and Social Guidelines Law and comprise the development of Djibouti as a major maritime port  efforts to combat poverty in urban and rural areas  industrialization and reduction of food dependence and energy dependence. If these targets are met  Djibouti will have not only the solid foundations so essential for developing its economic activities but also a better chance of reaching a level of economic viability that will enable it to contribute to efforts to achieve collective self- sufficiency  as reflected in the action being undertaken to bring about viable economic co-operation among the developing countries. The Republic of Djibouti cannot  however  successfully carry out this development strategy solely by its own means  without the financial  material and technical support of the international community. In this connection the Government of the Republic is organizing a pledging conference  to be held in the city of Djibouti from 21 to 23 November 1983  in order to set out its development programme and its financing needs in the hope of winning the support of Member States and international organizations. The Republic of Djibouti is pinning all its hopes on the success of this conference for the launching of its socio-economic development programme and the consolidation of its national independence. The implementation of its development programme will also help Djibouti to play a full regional and international role in efforts to promote peace and stability. I now turn to the question of refugees. Efforts to find a solution to this problem have always been a major concern for my Government  since there is practically no capacity to absorb refugees in Djibouti. The actions now being taken as a result of an agreement between the Governments of Djibouti and Ethiopia and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in order to find a lasting solution to the refugee problem are encouraging. Repatriation freely consented to by refugees is the most appropriate solution. The process of repatriation on a strictly voluntary basis is backed up by a programme to rehabilitate refugees in their countries of origin. The programme is spread over several months. Initial operations started on 19 September 1983  and 700 refugees have already been resettled in their villages of origin. Since the achievement of our own objectives has taught us to coexist with all countries in a genuine spirit of co-operation and understanding  we are equally devoted to the principle of good-neighborliness  and we reaffirm our desire to maintain a prudent policy of positive neutrality in our international relations. We respect and fully support the tireless efforts being made by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to preserve the principles and fundamental ideals on which it was founded  in the teeth of the constant tensions engendered by the international crisis. We are convinced that these ideals are in complete harmony with the principles to which the non-aligned countries intend to adhere both nationally and internationally. We call upon all countries to respect the sovereign and inalienable rights of other countries which are free to choose  without foreign influence  the nature of their political  economic and social systems  as well as the kind of relations they want to have with other States and international organizations. We vigorously oppose and condemn the oppression of one people by another and the denial of the exercise of the fundamental rights of a people. We equally condemn all policies of segregation and racism  including Zionism  racial discrimination and apartheid. We are deeply concerned by the constant rivalry between the super-Powers  which are vying for various spheres of influence in many parts of the world. We are convinced that this rivalry fosters tension in these areas  and we make a pressing appeal to them to refrain from undertaking any actions and initiatives which would aggravate an already extremely perilous international situation. Regarding the international economy  the events of recent years have increased the tensions which beset international economic relations  and we are very concerned about the deterioration of the world economic situation. The speed and extent of the effects of the deterioration of the international economic situation have taken on catastrophic proportions and threaten the peace and stability of the most seriously affected regions. To face the present difficulties affecting the world economy and the structural and adjustment problems in all sectors of the national economy  we must seek the best possible way of working out a new order of international economic relations which will help to promote economic and social stability. No one can gainsay the vital need for economic recovery at a time when three quarters of the world population are in an extremely difficult economic situation  with very dubious economic prospects  and when one third of this population live in a state of poverty and deprivation. The world cannot stand idly by while vast human and material resources are wasted on the arms race. There can be no equitable and viable system of international economic co-operation without a radical change in existing structures. Furthermore  the countries of the third world can no longer accept a status which does not involve them on an equal footing in world efforts to promote genuine economic development in conditions of stability that will give every citizen of these countries the opportunity and the right to enjoy a decent social  economic and political life. The crisis at present besetting the world has highlighted the interdependence of nations  and growth can be ensured only through close international co-operation. The Republic of Djibouti is convinced that only joint action on the part of all countries will make it possible to restructure the world economy and to establish more equitable and sound relations. We are very pleased to see that the international community has been pursuing a constructive and serious dialogue in various international forums in various capitals and other important cities of the world  as part of those efforts designed to resolve equitably the difficulties in international economic systems. We are convinced that the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which was held at New Delhi in March 1983  the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  at Buenos Aires in April  the Summit of Industrialized Nations at Williamsburg the following month and the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  at Belgrade in June  have all provided excellent opportunities for seeking better solutions to the international economic crisis. Despite all these valuable efforts  we have noted that the prospects for economic recovery are not very encouraging  particularly in the developing countries  and even less in the least developed countries. Nevertheless  we have not lost hope. In this connection  we would like to give our full support to a positive  world-wide dialogue designed to evolve a concerted and global programme of action which could revitalize the world economy and give it new impetus  while at the same time contributing to the accelerated development of the countries of the third world. I turn now to the Horn of Africa. Since independence the Republic of Djibouti has always felt that only dialogue among the parties involved could establish a peace process in that region and has observed a constructive neutrality in this conflict. We have supported all efforts to bring about direct negotiations between the belligerents. We remain convinced that it is only dialogue among the parties to the conflict which will make it possible to reduce tensions and to find a just and peaceful solution to the problems which prevail in that region. As to the region of the Indian Ocean  the Republic of Djibouti  a littoral State  is particularly concerned at the growth of tension in that part of the world. The Republic of Djibouti attaches great importance to the aim of making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace because we are aware of the security questions raised by that concept  particularly for the littoral and hinterland States. This is why we fully support the desire expressed by these States as well as by other peace-loving countries which intend to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  as clearly provided in the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly. We commend the efforts of the Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean to convene the Conference on the Indian Ocean at Colombo in the near future. In this respect  we should once again like to make an appeal to all Member States to co-operate in ensuring the success of this Conference. The situation in the Middle East continues to threaten the stability of the countries in the region  as well as international peace and security. The premeditated actions of the Israeli aggressors against Arab countries and the Palestinian people have taken on alarming dimensions which have unmasked the true face of Zionism. Israel  protected by its faithful allies  has not balked at committing increasing acts of violence against the inhabitants of the occupied Arab territories  particularly by pursuing its expansionist policies by setting up illegal colonies and by endeavoring to modify the status of the Holy City of Jerusalem. It is extremely regrettable that all solutions hitherto proposed to resolve the crisis in the Middle East have not touched the root of the problem of the Middle East. The entire world is convinced that there can be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East as long as the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are not fully recognized and exercised  including its right to return to its homeland and to establish its own independent Palestinian state. All the efforts to resolve peacefully the question of the Middle East should involve the full association of the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in all negotiations which directly or indirectly affect the fate of the Palestinians. The final declaration of the Third Islamic Summit Conference  which was held at Mecca-Taif in January 1981  as well as the peace plan adopted at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  in September 1982 at Fez '"" indicate how anxious the Arab and Islamic world is to find a peaceful solution to the problem of the Middle East. This plan takes into account the real intentions of the Arab and Muslim peoples and is in harmony with the resolutions of the United Nations on the question of Palestine. In view of this situation and all the peace efforts  the Security Council should meet its responsibilities towards the Palestinian people and make the necessary arrangements to endorse and to follow up the Geneva Declaration on Palestine and the Programme of Action adopted at the International Conference on the Question of Palestine held in September."" Lebanon is agony  seeing its sons dying in a war which is not of its own making. The situation which prevails in this country is  simply  the obvious consequence of the repeated aggression to which this State has been subjected. The whole of international opinion has many times condemned Israel's efforts to undermine Lebanese sovereignty. We stand aghast at the magnitude of the bloody events which are destroying the human and material resources of Lebanon. We stand amazed at the interference which has plunged this country into the shadows. It is high time that the voice of wisdom prevailed and that the carnage was ended. It is high time for ail sides to take into account the major and legitimate interests of the Lebanese people. We welcome the efforts made by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia together with the Lebanese and Syrian brothers which have led to a cease-fire. It is our hope and our desire that this laudable action will be crowned with success and that these efforts will make it possible to resolve the Palestinian problem and will lead to lasting peace and stability in the Middle East. The Republic of Djibouti  which supports all efforts at negotiation and dialogue  is fiercely opposed to all those who want to use this tragic situation as a pretext for splitting up this State. Lebanon must preserve its integrity; Lebanon must maintain its sovereignty; Lebanon is one and indivisible. We are extremely troubled by the fact that the conflict between Iran and Iraq continues. This has inevitably resulted not only in a depletion of the material and human resources of those two fraternal Islamic countries  but in a threat to peace and security in that region and in the rest of the world. Once again we reiterate our full support for the efforts and the good offices of the United Nations  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Gulf Co-operation Council in the search for a peaceful solution to this unhappy problem. We urge them once again to redouble their efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement which will make it possible to re-establish peace in that region. We wish to pay a tribute to the Government of Iraq for having taken the positive initiative of proposing a suspension of military operations against Iran and ending the war. We urge the other party to undertake the same commitment. We appeal to those two fraternal Islamic countries to realize the need to resolve their disputes in accordance with the principles of the Islamic fraternity and the solidarity of States members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  in order to prevent any further bloodshed and destruction. The prevailing situation in southern Africa is a subject of grave concern to the international community and  more specifically  to Africa. The constant tensions and conflicts in this region cannot be eliminated as long as the apartheid system of South Africa is not abolished and as long as Namibia is not completely rid of the illegal occupation of the South African regime. Maintaining its intransigent attitude  the Pretoria regime has not changed its policies or its methods of repression of the African majority in South Africa. Although it has been an object of universal censure  the Pretoria regime continues to defy international public opinion  as well as the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. We are profoundly convinced and persuaded that no peaceful change can take place until global economic sanctions are imposed as part of a concerted international plan and until a total embargo on weapons is rigorously applied against South Africa  in accordance with the recommendations of the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa  which was held in Paris in May 1981."" The deadlock in Namibia may well have unfortunate repercussions and may permanently endanger peace and security in that region. It has become clear that the South African regime is no longer prepared to accept a negotiated settlement of the Namibian question on the basis of the implementation by the United Nations of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  including the organization of free and fair elections in Namibia under the supervision and control of the United Nations. Despite the intensive consultations aimed at facilitating the speedy execution of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  South Africa is deliberately trying to deflect the attention of the world public from these objectives and unilaterally puts forward unacceptable pre-conditions in order to thwart any efforts and to prolong the negotiation process which is supposed to lead to the independence of Namibia under the aegis of SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people. It is regrettable that the Security Council cannot fulfill its basic responsibility by preventing South Africa from continuing to subject the Namibian people to this barbaric treatment and consolidating its policy of occupation of the Namibian territory. We condemn the criminal acts of terrorism and armed aggression of South Africa against the independent States surrounding it  that is  the front-line States. The tragedy in Chad has  to our great regret  become a dangerous situation which may well threaten peace and security in Africa. We have been following with grave concern and great exasperation the vicissitudes of this ill-fated and fratricidal war  which is draining the material and human resources of that country and destroying the infrastructure so necessary to it. We are alarmed at the escalation of the conflict which continues to prolong the suffering of the people of Chad and which may well lead to a serious conflict that could take on unforeseeable dimensions. We consider that any initiative on Chad must be aimed at achieving an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign troops to make it possible for the various factions among the people of Chad to become reconciled and to repair the damage done. We urge these factions to work together to bring about the national reconciliation that would provide a sound foundation for lasting peace in Chad. We insist that any agreement concerning the people of Chad should protect them from any intervention  interference or domination from abroad. Regarding Western Sahara  we reaffirm the right of the Sahraoui people to self-determination. In this connection we welcome the efforts of the OAU to promote a just and final settlement of the problem of Western Sahara. We urge the members of the Implementation Committee  together with the parties to the conflict and in co-operation with the United Nations  to take all the necessary steps to ensure that the recommendations of the OAU are properly applied. It is our hope that the recent diplomatic efforts which have been relentlessly pursued by the Maghreb States will also make an effective contribution to what is already being done by the OAU and the United Nations to resolve the question of Western Sahara. The situation in Afghanistan is a subject of grave concern to us ail  and a solution must be found for this crisis. We profoundly regret the fact that the occupying Power has as yet not seen fit to comply with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 37/37. In that resolution the vast majority of the international community called for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. Military intervention and domination have created a tragic situation in Afghanistan  threatening peace and security in that part of the world and thus contributing to the deterioration in international relations. The continuing presence of these forces has created a precedent jeopardizing the principles of non-intervention and noninterference  as well as the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the States of the region. We are convinced that the only way to put an end to the tragedy of Afghanistan is to respect those principles and to call for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan so that the people of that country may once again enjoy the right to choose their own political  economic and social system free from outside intervention and so that the Afghan refugees may return freely to their homes in peace and in dignity. The situation in Kampuchea has not changed  despite repeated appeals by the international community and the General Assembly for a speedy  comprehensive settlement of this conflict. The Republic of Djibouti reiterates that it is essential for all foreign forces to withdraw from Kampuchea and that there should be an overall political settlement of this question. With regard to the question of Korea  the Government of Djibouti is firmly convinced that inter-Korean negotiations are the only political course for that country to follow. It is essential that this dialogue  in which neither party imposes its views on the others  be resumed as quickly as possible  given the urgent need to reduce present tensions  to re-establish trust between the parties and to bring about a lasting peace in the Korean peninsula. In conclusion  we hope and trust that peace and prosperity will prevail over tension and war. The Assembly  we are quite certain  will respond to the hopes of millions of human beings who wish to build the future of their nation in peace and to construct a better world  where human life will be more real  more concrete. Human beings  wherever they may be  have not been put on earth to make war but to enjoy peace in justice and equality. Compromise  dialogue and co-operation should be our guiding values in helping us to break the equilibrium of terror and fear. We must all concert our efforts and our actions in order to realize the legitimate aspirations of our peoples."
"41",1947,"DNK",38,1983,"ï»¿186.	Mr. May I first of all offer to Mr. Illueca my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I can assure him of the full co-operation of the Danish delegation in performing the duties of his high office.187.	I also wish to extend a most cordial welcome to Saint Christopher and Nevis as the newest member of the United Nations family.188.	We have all come together here to seek ways and means of maintaining international peace and furthering progress for the peoples of the world. Unfortunately  developments over the years have not made it easier for us to bear this awesome responsibility. On the contrary  the tasks ahead of us may seem even heavier than those we have tackled in the past. But we must see them as challenges rather than as threats.189.	In the past year very few conflicts  if any  have been settled. In fact  existing conflicts have escalated and new ones have arisen. Still  the world community of nations provides an opportunity for the parties to meet and listen to each other and thereby to take a dignified and responsible approach to the pursuit of international objectives in respect for the rights and interests of others. Bilateral diplomacy most often fails at the very time when a conflict comes to a head  and it is precisely in such situations that multinational diplomacy at the United Nations can come to the rescue. The very existence of this forum is one of the most important instruments of the international community for confidence-building measures.190.	We saw a dramatic fresh example of the need for confidence-building only a few weeks ago when 269 innocent airline passengers lost their lives as victims of the excessive assertion of security interests.191.	Against that background  the Danish Government notes with pleasure that the American Government has once again confirmed its readiness for continuing the dialogue with the Soviet Union in the negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces at Geneva.192.	I strongly hope that the Soviet Union will respond positively to the new American proposals which are designed to meet Soviet concerns. It is now up to the Soviet Union to show similar flexibility at Geneva.193.	The Secretary-General  in his report to last year's General Assembly  presented some thoughts and ideas on the role of the Organization. They were neither new nor revolutionary  but they came at a time when a warning was needed and from the person obviously most qualified to voice it. The world has embarked on an exceedingly dangerous course. Governments ignore the United Nations and seek to attain their political goals by resorting to the threat or use of force. By doing so they render the United Nations impotent to pursue its most important purpose: the maintenance of international peace and security. When the United Nations is allowed to play its rightful role  it is often too late. And then  perhaps  understandably but no less unjustly  the United Nations is blamed for the lack of results.194.	In confirmation of their traditional strong support for the United Nations  the Nordic countries have prepared a report containing suggestions on possible measures to strengthen the United Nations. The latest meeting of the Nordic Foreign Ministers called attention to the report and reaffirmed that the Nordic Governments will continue their active efforts to strengthen the United Nations as a universal peace-keeping and peace-making organization.195.	He Secretary-General's appeal struck a resonant chord with the Member States. The many positive and constructive contributions fostered by the Secretary- General's report should not  however  become a pretext for self-congratulation. In this year's report the Secretary-General rightly stresses that there is still a long way to go.196.	Denmark is fortunate to be situated in a region where peace has been maintained for nearly four decades. Nevertheless  we remain conscious that peace cannot be taken for granted. Without persistent efforts and a dialogue encompassing all countries in our region  it will not be possible to preserve confidence among the nations.197.	Geography places Europe at the centre of the East- West conflict whose adverse effects are felt very strongly also in other parts of the world. Whatever progress we can achieve in our a/ea will be beneficial also to developments in other parts of the world where the tension may be even greater. Consequently  there is a great need for a comprehensive East-West dialogue on a wide range of subjects  political as well as economic.198.	The process initiated by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a most important channel for such a dialogue. And it is indeed encouraging that East and West  with the precious help of neutral and non-aligned participating States  have reached agreement on a number of substantial issues at the Conference follow-up meeting at Madrid. We hope this accomplishment may influence general East-West relations in a positive direction.199.	Denmark's participation in European political cooperation is yet another manifestation of our confidence in international diplomacy. Through this co-operation we  the ten nations of the European Community  seek to play a constructive role in offering our political support for negotiated settlements of many regional conflicts. The growing interest in this form of political co-operation testifies to the value of a political effort which gathers its strength not from military power  but from a multilateral framework for co-operation between peace-loving nations.200.	Since the last session of the General Assembly there has been little substantive progress in the Middle East situation. Developments over the past year have made it even more manifest that the Palestinian problem is the core of the Middle East conflict and that some sort of negotiated agreement between Israel and the Palestinians must be established. Only then will progress towards a generally acceptable Arab-Israeli settlement be possible. The Danish Government is firmly convinced that it is in the best interests of Israel to hold out the prospect of a partnership with the Palestiniansâa partnership of equals. The Palestinians  for their part  should clearly recognize that the only path to fulfilment of their legitimate national aspirations is the quest for mutual recognition with the State of Israel. The time has come for Arabs and Israelis to recognize that their maximum aims are unattainable and that they must negotiate with each other to achieve peace.201.	The hopes for an historic compromise between Israel and the Palestinians may have been shaken by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and its dramatic and indeed tragic aftermath. But bitterness and hostility must not make us lose sight of the need to search for some outline of a Middle East peace settlement.202.	Against this background  the Danish Government welcomed the American initiative contained in President Reagan's speech on 1 September of last year.3 It has the merit of drawing a proper distinction between a firm commitment to Israel's security and opposition to Israel's claim to sovereignty over the occupied territories. We hope that the prospect of exchanging territory for peace is still a powerful allurement to Israel. We were also encouraged by the Fez Declaration' as a clearer manifestation of an Arab willingness to compromise.203.	Regrettably  these initiatives have not so far initiated a process leading towards a break with the immobility of the past. To create a situation in which diplomacy can perform usefully  change is crucial in two respects.204.	First  the settlement process in the occupied territories must be halted. The Arab identity of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip must be preserved in order to keep options open for the future of these territories. Their political destiny must be determined by the inhabitants. If the demand for negotiations is to be meaningful it is imperative that Israel should not pre-empt the future.205.	Secondly  foreign forces must be withdrawn from Lebanese territory. This would be an important step in support of the determined action of President Gemayel and his Government to re-establish Lebanon's unity  sovereignty and independence  and its right to live within internationally recognized frontiers. My Government fully supports the right of the Government of Lebanon to extend its authority to all parts of Lebanese territory. We welcome the cease-fire which took effect yesterday morning. We hope that it will be the first step towards a national reconciliation in that country.206.	In this connection I also wish to place on record the Danish Government's regret that the conflict between Iran and Iraq continues despite the calls of the Security Council and the General Assembly  the efforts of the special representative of the Secretary-General and the appeals and peace initiatives of various groups of countries  including the 10 member States of the European Communities. The conflict remains a serious threat to the whole region. I call once again on the parties to accept an immediate cease-fire  to withdraw all forces behind the internationally recognized frontiers and to seek a just and honourable negotiated settlement.207.	The presence of Soviet forces in Afghanistan continues to threaten the stability of the entire South-West Asian region and the development of harmonious East- West relations. Furthermore: the situation in Afghanistan has inflicted heavy suffering on the population  of which roughly one fifth has had to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. Since the invasion of Afghanistan the General Assembly has repeatedly appealed to the Soviet Union to withdraw its forces so as to enable Afghanistan to return to its former independent and non-aligned status. These appeals have been supplemented by several peace initiatives which  unfortunately  have been of no avail so far. Today I wish once again to add my Government's voice to all the many calls for withdrawal of the Soviet forces and for the recognition of the right of the Afghan people to self-determination.208.	Similarly  the armed Vietnamese intervention in Kampuchea almost five years ago remains a serious threat to peace and stability in South-East Asia. Recalling the increasing and overwhelming support which the resolutions on the Kampuchean situation have received in the General Assembly over the years  I reiterate the appeal for a comprehensive political settlement which would secure complete withdrawal of all foreign forces  the right of the Kampuchean people to determine its own destiny through free elections supervised by the United Nations  respect for the independence and neutrality of Kampuchea and a commitment by all States to refrain from interfering in its internal affairs.209.	Developments in southern Africa present a growing danger to peace and stability.210.	Denmark has repeatedly condemned South Africa's political  economic and military pressure against neighbouring Statesânot least its continued occupation of areas of southern Angola. Recently South Africa has exerted brutal pressure on a defenceless independent State  Lesotho. South Africa's blockade against Lesotho and its pressure for expulsion or extradition of South African refugees arc in flagrant violation of international law. At the same time  South Africa continues its illegal occupation of Namibia  in defiance of the United Nations. Denmark is ready to support all efforts towards urgent implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  and we welcome the renewed efforts of the Secretary-General. The settlement of extraneous political issues cannot be a precondition for implementing the United Nations plan for Namibia's independence.211.	In South Africa itself injustice and repression prevail. The fundamental elements of the apartheid system remain unchanged. In some respects they have even become more sophisticated. Planned constitutional amendments pay nothing but lip service to the aspirations of the non-white South Africans to real political influence. And they do not address the question of political rights for the country's black majority.212.	Denmark is more than ever convinced of the need to increase international pressure on South Africa and to make it more effective. Developments since the last session have unfortunatelyâbut abundantlyâdemonstrated that a peaceful abolition of the apartheid system can be brought about only through effective international pressure.213.	Humanitarian and educational assistance to the victims of oppression in southern Africa remains an essential element of Denmark's policy with regard to that region. Denmark's calls on all Members of the United Nations to provide such assistance in order to help alleviate human suffering in southern Africa.214.	Latin America is attracting growing international attention. Economically  some countries in the region have a very high potential. Others are among the most impoverished in the world. In many Latin American countries a process of economic growth and transformation is under way while a change of their political structures towards democratic rule is taking place We follow this development attentively and with sympathy. But we are deeply concerned at the attacks on democracy and violations of human rights which have become a part of every-day life in many of these countries. We hope that the countries of Latin America will become full-fledged demands and that the efforts to alleviate the economic and  al injustices in the region which are the root cause of its serious political problems will be successful.215.	The situation in Central America is particularly threatening because the risk of a more comprehensive armed conflict can no longer be disregarded. We remain convinced that the conflicts in Central America can be settled only through negotiation. We have therefore welcomed the initiative of the Contadora Group of countries  which seems to be bearing fruit.216.	The Secretary-General stated  in his address to the Committee on Disarmament early this year ' that he was acutely conscious of the crucial stage we have reached in the history of mankind's efforts at disarmament  an endeavour of supreme importance for the preservation of human life and values. The Danish Government fully shares the Secretary-General's concern.217.	It is said that the present international climate is not very conducive to disarmament efforts. It is indisputable that progress in disarmament and arms control depends on the existence of confidence among States  and mainlyâbut not exclusivelyâbetween the two States which are most directly responsible for the great arsenals of nuclear weapons. The best way to build such confidence is through direct and serious dialogue. Disarmament issues are an urgent topic for such a dialogue  since the relationship between disarmament efforts and other confidence-building measures is one of interdependence all interaction. Nuclear disarmament remains the issue of the highest priority. At the bilateral level the United Â«5s and the Soviet Union have conducted negotiations on mutual reductions of nuclear strategic arms for well over a year. The Danish Government hopes that these difficult negotiations will result in an early agreement on substantial reductions of those weapons.223.	The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on intermediate-range nuclear forces are of special concern to us. We hope  and we believe  that the negotiation"" will lead to concrete results even before the end of this year. Should this effort fail we must fear that the arms up will continue and that we cannot expect a renewal or the willingness expressed by the Atlantic alliance in 1979 to seek a negotiated correction of the imbalance created by the Soviet Union's deployment of additional SS-20 missiles.224.	Parallel multilateral negotiations are taking place at Geneva in the Committee on Disarmament. We clearly see that the bilateral negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union have had such an impact on the Geneva negotiations that they have almost become stalemated. This is understandable  but certainly not acceptable. Agreement on a comprehensive test-ban treaty and a convention banning chemical weapons remain objectives of prime importance  and Danish Government urges all parties to show good will and flexibility.225.	In this context  I should like to add that the Danish Government supports all realistic efforts to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in conformity with the provisions of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session  devoted to disarmament.226.	It is a cause of great concern that serious international negotiations concerning the question of preventing an arms race in outer space  including anti-satellite weapons  have not yet been initiated. The Danish Government hopes that the Committee on Disarmament will agree to deal with this important and complex question at its next session.227.	The world-wide buildup of conventional arms is a matter of growing concern. Conventional weapons are the weapons used in current conflicts  and the resources absorbed by the conventional arsenals exceed by far the funds spent on nuclear weapons. We trust that the report of the Group of Experts on All Aspects of the Conventional Arms Race and on Disarmament relating to Conventional Weapons and Armed Forces will provide a valuable basis for the deliberations of the next session.228.	A question constantly on our minds is how best to ensure that the United Nations will be able to play an effective and decisive role in disarmament. At this session once again  the agenda includes a vast number of disarmament items. We do not  however  accomplish much by adopting a long list of resolutions. What we lack is not disarmament proposals  but realistic disarmament efforts concentrating on the most vital problems.229.	We must not forget  however  that wars can be fought with fewer  or less deadly weapons. It is not enough to look at the means of war; we must identify the causes and try to eliminate them.230.	The problems of today are global. In matters of peace and security this has been evident for decades. But the same lesson can be learnt in many other respects also. Our world is restricted. So are some of its resources. Others  however  can be expanded. We must learn to develop and share the world and its resources to the benefits of us all.231.	The closing paragraph of the New Delhi Message  proclaimed by the recent Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  contains a sentence which is phrased in such eloquent language that I should like to quote it: ""The earth belongs to us allâlet us cherish it in peace and true brotherhood  based on the dignity and equality of man.""232.	In several statements  including that of the Secretary-General  international economic problems have been emphasized. This is not only because of the close interrelationship between the world economic situation and international stability and security.233.	Since the end of the 1970s  most countries  developed and developing alike  have experienced the consequences of a global recession. In recent months  however  signs of change have emerged. Recovery seems to be under way in some major industrialized countries  and it is the responsibility of the international community to seize this opportunity to restore sustained economic growth and development.234.	To do so  all nations must co-operate in creating new and more equitable economic relations. In June of this year  at Belgrade  we all faced this challenge. The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development did not achieve a major breakthrough in the North-South dialogue. But is stressed the interrelationship between the various economic issues currently being discussed by the international community and pointed out ways to carry on the process of economic co-operation in the appropriate forums.235.	But most of all the Conference emphasized that the concept of global interdependence is more than just a catchword. Experience  including that of the sixth session of the Conference  has proved the need to consider all the interlinked economic questions. Consequently  Denmark continues to support an early launching of global negotiations covering all major issues in the world economic area.236.	The serious problems of the developing countries impose increased obligations on all developed countries  especially towards the poorest countries of the third world. A serious setback for the results achieved so far in development co-operation must be avoided. In this respect  the performance of donor countries in the field of official development assistance remains significant. My Government noted with pleasure that all developed donor countries  irrespective of their attitudes to the 0.7 per cent target and to the time-frame for its achievement  committed themselves in their statements at the Conference to redouble their efforts to expand official development assistance.237.	It will be necessary to channel more resources to income- and employment-generating activities in developing countries and to work for higher efficiency in the management of development. Increased production  especially in the agricultural sector  is a prerequisite for sustained economic development.238.	In these efforts we must pay special attention to the conditions of the poorest segments of the world population. The World Development Report of the World Bank has repeatedly stated that  even with an annual growth to gross national product of 5 to 6 per cent  over 600 million people in the developing countries will be below the poverty line by the year 2000 unless the pattern of growth is modified to put more emphasis on poverty alleviation. The International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade is a relevant instrument to promote these demands for development co-operation. We look forward to the mid-term review which is to take place next year.239.	As one of the major contributors to the development activities of the United Nations family  my Government is concerned about the continued stagnation in the resource flow to the United Nations development system  and especially to UNDP. My Government has decided to propose to the Danish Parliament that Denmark's contribution to UNDP be increased by 8.5 per cent next year. I hope that other countries will also be able to increase their support to UNDP.240.	I have not touched upon a number of other important economic problems. The Danish Government is confident  however  that all these major topics will be given due attention during this session  with due regard for the need for improved international co-operation to restore world growth and development.241.	Human rights and fundamental freedoms  as well as the dignity of man  are the very essence of the philosophy upon which the United Nations is built. In spite of the fact that all Member States of the United Nations have solemnly committed themselves to promote respect for  and observance of  human rights  we are constantly confronted with serious and massive violations of human rights in many parts of the world under different pretexts and more or less sophisticated disguises. Accordingly  no effort must be spared to ensure that recognition and observance of human rights remain at the heart of the policies and strategies of the Organization  thereby fulfilling the ideals of the Charter.242.	I wish to draw special attention to the cases where people are silenced or exposed to inhuman treatment just because they fight for the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms. They deserve an effective and courageous response by the United Nations to its moral and legal obligations.243.	Denmark strongly supports the efforts initiated by the Commission on Human Rights to combat the appalling practices of torture  summary or arbitrary execution and disappearance.244.	I hope that many countries will join in our endeavours to alleviate the sufferings of victims of torture by making substantial contributions to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture established in 1981 for that particular purpose. Subject to parliamentary approval  my Government intends to make another substantial contribution to the Fund in 1984.245.	I am aware that my statement may have sounded like a litany on increased tension  aggravated conflicts  and unresolved economic problems. I am afraid it is also a realistic assessment of the world situation today. It will no doubt be reflected in the debate during the coming weeks here. We need not become despondent  however. On the contrary  we must accept the challenge and try harder than ever to reach accommodation and reconciliation.246.	What better goal  then  for our work than the theme of the Buenos Aires Platform from the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 earlier this year: Dialogue and Consensus.247.	We must be willing to listen to each other's points of view and to make every effort to find the common ground for concerted action in which we can all join. Only through a sincere dialogue and genuine consensus can we hope to reach real and lasting solutions to the world's problems. "
"42",1992,"DOM",38,1983,"ï»¿156.	Allow me first of all to express my most sincere congratulations to Mr. Illueca on his election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  an election which has a special meaning for the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Our regional group is proud and honoured at his election  since his well-known skill and experience will ensure that the work of this session will be guided to a successful conclusion.157.	This is a fitting occasion to highlight the work accomplished by the outgoing President  Mr. Imre Hollai  who so ably led the proceedings of the thirty-seventh session.158.	Since my country is a member of the great family of the Caribbean  we are pleased to welcome most cordially the new free  sovereign and independent State of Saint Christopher and Nevis to the Organization. We share with our brothers of that new nation their legitimate satisfaction at having exercised the most sacred rights of peoples: self-determination. 159.	Our country was gratified to be present at the celebration of the national independence of this fraternal country and to bring a message of friendship and cooperation from the Dominican Government and the people  reaffirming once again the Caribbean focus of the present policy of the Dominican Republic.160.	We come to this thirty-eighth session deeply concerned at the continued deterioration of various aspects of the international scene. The crises afflicting peace- loving nations require of the Organization a joint effort to seek the means and machinery to face the problems and find appropriate solutions.161.	This great effort should be characterized by active international co-operation with the united participation of all the Members of the United Nations.162.	At this difficult time in the history of mankind international co-operation  which is an essential element for harmonious coexistence among nations  must be the force behind our actions if we are to overcome the present situation.163.	At this stage of international life  the major decisions of concern to mankind should not be the purview of a small and exclusive group of nations. Our country looks for more dynamic international co-operation reflected in all areasâmainly in the political  economic  scientific and cultural spheresâso that the major decisions reached on issues of great importance to all may be backed by a feeling of unity and solidarity  which is essential for their effective implementation.164.	The undeniable interdependence of nations  an essential characteristic of contemporary international relations  makes it necessary that international co-operation be based essentially on solidarityâa solidarity which can contribute decisively to the genuine development of peoples.165.	At the present time  when the international community is troubled by conflicts  tension and anguish  we must draw attention to Article 2  paragraph 3 of the Charter  which daily assume more significance in international relations: All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security  and justice  are not endangered.166.	The preservation of peace is the fundamental duty of the United Nations. To prevent and eliminate threats to international peace and security by means of peaceful settlement of disputes is a commitment which binds all Members  especially the permanent members of the Security Council.167.	We fully agree with the Secretary-General when  in his annual report on the work of the Organization [y4/3#/V]  he points out that It is the weakening of this commitment that has  perhaps more than any other factor  led to the partial paralysis of the United Nations as the guardian of international peace and security.168.	In view of the present conflicts  tensions and distress  it is urgent and necessary that we reaffirm our readiness to heed the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes  for that principle is the very foundation of harmonious coexistence among peoples.169.	In an analysis of the problems afflicting the world  we cannot omit the grave danger posed by the headlong arms race pursued by the super-Powers. We must therefore express our concern at the virtual paralysis of disarmament negotiations. Faced with the apocalyptic image of a nuclear holocaust  the international community must demand that the big Powers make greater efforts which could lead to effective agreements and to their speedy implementation.170.	The Dominican Republic considers that we must now reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equality of rights of men and women and of nations large and small. We must fight to create conditions in which it will be possible to maintain justice and respect for obligations stemming from treaties and other sources of international law.171.	It was with well-founded pride that the Dominican head of State  Mr. Salvador Jorge Blanco  declared  when he set forth the foreign policy of the country on the occasion of the first anniversary of his Government  We have maintained a line of conduct which respects all the principles and norms of international law.172.	A prerequisite for giving effect to legitimate aspirations for a lasting and stable peace in the world community is the search for just and viable solutions to the many international conflicts facing us.173.	Among those conflicts  that in the Middle East deserves special attention. We reiterate our conviction that the problems of that troubled region of the world have shown that the question of Palestine is one of the decisive factors in the crisis. Hence we believe that there can be no effective and lasting solution in the absence of arrangements enabling the Palestinian people to exercise its inalienable right of self-determination  as has been recognized by this world Organization.174.	At the thirty-seventh session my country  together with the great majority of the States Members of the Organization  supported the right of the Palestinian people to establish a State on Palestinian territory. Likewise  we reiterate our view that any peaceful solution in this troubled region must take into account Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which endorses  infer the right of the State of Israel to exist.175.	We are also concerned about the situation in Lebanon. We hope that the recently announced cease-fire will be effective and will promote constructive dialogue  putting an end to that grave conflict and ensuring the territorial integrity and sovereignty of that torn nation.176.	The Dominican Republic  which has always maintained a policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and is convinced that this is the essential basis of peace  is concerned at the foreign intervention in Chad  in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea in violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.177.	Furthermore  we support the long-desired unification of the Korean people in a sovereign State by means of an agreement consistent with the objectives of the Charter.178.	Nor can we remain silent about our frustration when we see that the just cause of the independence of the Namibian people has moved no further towards success  in spite of the appeals of the international community.179.	From the very day the present Government of the Dominican Republic took office it has constantly expressed its profound concern over the crisis affecting the Central American region. We cannot forget that since we met at the thirty-seventh session the Central American conflict has noticeably worsened through a rise in violence  border incidents and other factors which have steadily increased the threat of a widespread military conflagration that could endanger the peace of the continent.180.	The Dominican Republic has always associated itself with the responsible advocates of political understanding  of a peaceful solution resulting from constructive dialogue  and of the elimination of age-old obstacles which  rooted in underdevelopment  social injustice and a lack of democratic institutions  are the root causes of this serious conflict involving brother peoples whose legitimate demands are in every way understandable.181.	Foreign interference  the unbridled arms race and ideological approaches that would place the problem in the framework of a broad and exclusive confrontation between the super-Powers  are powerful contributing factors in a decisive worsening of the situation.182.	None the less  all is not bleak for the future of the region. Faced with the concern and legitimate interest of many peoples  organizations and political forces and with the demands of an international community which is deeply concerned and determined to avoid an all-out war or the slow and ruinous process of a chronic crisis like that in the Middle East  the surrounding countries have taken the significant step of forming the Contadora Group  which has earned unanimous international support  with my country among the first to praise its efforts.183.	The Contadora Group has carried out praiseworthy work. It has built a cordon sanitaire that can prevent a widespread war  the dangerous military solution  whose political and social costs would be lethal to the development of the peoples of the area and to their legitimate desires for democracy and freedom. Such a questionable solution would be essentially a temporary one and would in the short term be a starting-point for new stages of tension and violence and would without doubt carry with it still greater risks. In the worst case  it would be the execrable peace of extermination of which the illustrious Roman historian warned in his celebrated annual.184.	Furthermore  the Contadora Group has created a framework for dialogue through which concrete proposals have been made on the basis of which a just  viable and lasting peace in Central America could be built.185.	The elements of those proposals should lead  in the regional framework  in accordance with the Cancun Declaration  to control of the arms race; the elimination of foreign advisers; the creation of demilitarized zones; the prohibition of the use of . . . some States for the development of political or military destabilization actions in other States; the eradication of transit of and traffic in arms; and the prohibition of other forms of aggression or interference in the internal affairs of any country in the area. [See186.	The Cancun line of thinking  the essence of which is regional political understanding based on respect for the principles of non-interference and the self-determination of peoples  necessarily implies a strengthening of democratic institutions  the guarantee of the observance of human rights and a programme of socio-economic development leading to social justice.187.	Recently  in a significant forward step  the Central American nations ratified a Document of Objectives which were formulated  on the basis of the Cancun Declaration  in Panama at the beginning of September.188.	Of course  it will now be a matter of implementing those agreements  and we are neither deceiving ourselves nor being pessimistic if we say in a sense of realism that that implementation will be difficult  that it will be an arduous task  given the extreme complexity of the factors fuelling the Central American tragedy.189.	Aware of that reality  the Presidents of the Contadora countries stated the following:We appeal to all members of the international community  especially those which have expressed sympathy with the efforts of the Contadora Group  and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairman of the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States  to contribute  with their experience and diplomatic capability  to the search for peaceful solutions to the problems of Central America. That appeal may be a realistic one. As has been stated  what is at issue is a complex problem with roots that are regional but magnified in many ways by interests alien to the region. The implementation of the Panama agreementsâwhat might be described as an attempt at a Central American peace projectâwill require concrete  broad and significant support for the Contadora Group by the international community.190.	The Dominican Republic has always considered that Contadora should be complemented by efforts of many types to remove obstacles and facilitate the implementation of agreements and solutions.191.	Recently  the President  Mr. Salvador Jorge Blanco  in a statement made during the celebration of his first year in office  said:The Dominican Republic's clear position in favour of Central American peace not only has been expressed in statements and declarations but has also been reflected in wide-ranging conversations and resolute action with heads of State and ministers of other nations  which have led to several official visits to our country.192.	An unshakable readiness for dialogue  good offices  mediation and contribution to all efforts likely to generate favourable conditions for peace in Central America is and always will be a constant of the foreign policy of the Dominican Republic  based not only on the duty of solidarity of all nations in the light of the principles of the international legal order but also on the fact that it is a Caribbean nation with a legitimate interest in preserving peace in a region in which  if it were caught up in a total military escalation  the security and institutionally of many nations such as our own would be endangered.193.	In my statement at the thirty-seventh session  I referred to an event in the south Atlantic which deeply touched Latin America and prompted a united reaction in support of Argentina's just territorial claims.194.	It is an unassailable fact that until the situation of the Malvinas Islands is resolved in a just and peaceful way it will continue to be a source of serious concern to our region. We therefore cordially urge the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to resume negotiations to find as soon as possible a peaceful solution to the dispute concerning sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands.195.	The Dominican Republic reaffirms once again in this world forum its forceful condemnation of the policy of apartheid  which we consider to be a crime against humanity. Similarly  we condemn and reject all forms of discrimination as a violation of human dignity.196.	The Dominican Republic has expressed in the Security Council its regret and concern at the tragedy of the Korean passenger aircraft and affirmed that that unhappy occurrence that cost the lives of 269 innocent people and deeply touched the conscience of the international community must not be repeated in any circumstances.197.	We reiterate that that tragic event must not prevent the continuation of efforts to ensure detente  disarmament and peace.198.	On the occasion of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the Dominican Republic cannot fail to record its strict observance of the norms and provisions of international conventions and instruments on human rights.199.	We repeat our conviction that respect for human rights constitutes a common good the protection of which is recognized in the norms of international law. We therefore affirm that respect for the fundamental rights of the human person is one of the most effective means of achieving peaceful coexistence for the member States of the international community.200.	During the last session we stated that the Dominican Republic unreservedly condemned violations of human rights in any part of the world  and we say it again today with equal conviction and force.201.	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights  in its article 27  enshrines cultural rights  that is  the right to participate in the cultural life of the community. We consider that the benefits of education  science and art must be shared by all and that every man and woman must be in a position to exercise his or her creative faculties. In this connection  we support in particular cultural exchanges and international co-operation as effective means of strengthening the spiritual links between peoples.202.	To ensure the harmonious and just development of all human activities  it is essential to improve the status and rights of women. At the national level  the Dominican Government has created in Santo Domingo a general bureau for the advancement of women. At the global level  I am particularly pleased to refer now to the recent inauguration in Santo Domingo of the headquarters of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women  a permanent United Nations agency.203.	For that purpose  our Government donated the building in which the Institute has established its headquarters. With that contribution the Dominican Republic has expressed its resolute support for the cause of women and their full integration in the political  economic  social and cultural life and in the process of development in those various sectors. .204.	The grave economic crisis afflicting the international community continues to be a source of great concern. Few countries have recorded any economic growth recently. The stagnation of trade is evident  the prices of raw materials remain depressed and the industrialized countries  in their effort to emerge from the quagmire of recession  are maintaining protectionist measures that obstruct free international trade.205.	The world-wide recession has  without any doubt  hit the underdeveloped world the hardest  as it lacks the industrial and financial potential and the social and technological development of the industrialized countries.206.	The third-world countries continue to face growing external indebtedness  generated mainly by the accumulation of balance-of-payment deficits  the flight of capital  the sharp decline in the gross national product  and fiscal deficits that cannot be financed. In some of them galloping inflation and mass unemployment persist. Moreover  our countries are experiencing a gradual contraction of income because of a deterioration in the terms of trade as a result of a decline in commodity prices and continued protectionist measures by the industrialized countries  to which we have already referred.207.	The Dominican Republic  as a developing country highly dependent on its exports of commodities  has of course not been able to escape the effects of the international economic crisis.208.	We must nevertheless point out that it has been an accomplishment of our Government  through rational and sound management of resources and of the nation's funds  not only to maintain and strengthen social peace and democratic institutions  but also to begin genuine economic recovery in many aspects. In this connection  in a recent issue of a major European magazine specializing in economic affairs  the Dominican Republic appears among the top 20 countries of the developing world with a healthy economy and in fourth place in the Americas. Likewise  our country has been placed twenty- seventh among all those countries in the world with regard to economies practiced to control inflation.209.	We know  however  that the major goals for full development will not be achieved without the concurrence of efforts and action by the international community to create a new and more just economic order among the peoples of the world.210.	At the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  in preparation for the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  the developing countries adopted the Buenos Aires Platform  which contains important statements with a view to reactivation of the world economy and accelerated development of the third-world countries  mainly in the areas of international trade  commodities  financing and other relevant issues.211.	In spite of the disappointing results of the sixth session  we consider that the statements in the Buenos Aires Platform constitute the most coherent basis for the promotion of the North-South dialogue and for eventual global negotiations from which the new international economic order may result  giving full effect to the economic rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.212.	The frustrating experience of Belgrade prompts us  furthermore  to reaffirm the need to strengthen and increase South-South co-operation as one of our main responses to the crisis.213.	We are pleased to recognize that our region has begun to take significant steps with determination and energy  following the example of Simon Bolivar  the Liberator  whose bicentenary we are enthusiastically celebrating.214.	Indeed  the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have begun a process of harmonizing measures enabling the region to face the present crisis  through the development of its capacity for action and strengthening its systems of co-operation. That process is a response to the initiative of the President of Ecuador  Mr. Osvaldo Hurtado Larrea  strongly supported by the Dominican President  Mr. Salvador Jorge Blanco  with the collaboration of the Latin American Economic System [LAES] and ECLA  whose work concluded with the so-called Santa Domingo Commitment  adopted by 26 countries at the meeting of personal representatives of heads of State or Government of Latin America and the Caribbean  held from 1 to 3 August at Santo Domingo.215.	In his statement opening that meeting  the President of the Dominican Republic stated the following:In keeping with our conviction as men of the Americas  we are fully at one with the idea of establishing a Latin American strategy expressed in a concurrence of views for negotiating with the industrialized countries and at the same time for uniting the will of our Government concerning the need to implement integrationist policies  both in international trade and in areas of production  energy  transport  technological development and other basic sectors of the economy of our peoples.216.	In the Santo Domingo Commitment  urgent attention is given to the adoption of a joint plan of action concentrating primarily on the areas of promoting and strengthening regional co-operation and integration  fostering intra-regional trade and supplying food  energy and services and on international financial and monetary problems.217.	The specific elements of the joint plan of action will be considered and formalized at a high political level at a Latin American economic conference to be held at Quito in January 1984. It will be convened by the President of Ecuador  in consultation with the other Governments of Latin America and the Caribbean. Preparatory work has been entrusted to a group over which we have the honour of presiding and which also includes Peru  Argentina  Jamaica  Ecuador and Costa Rica.218.	Recently  at Caracas  the ninth regular meeting of the Latin American Council of SELA took place. Its main resolutions are aimed at strengthening the regional negotiating capacity. Of particular interest is resolution 179  relating to Latin American and Caribbean support for the convening of the above-mentioned Latin American economic conference at Quito.219.	The developing countries require the priority attention of multilateral financial institutions in order to resolve their financing and international trading problems  as these have a negative impact on the well-being of their peoples  affecting their pace of development and the appropriate level of domestic economic activity  which leads to an increase in social and political tensions.220.	While we recognize the efforts made by IMF to help countries in their adjustment processes  we understand that the terms involved in the financial stabilization programmes inherent in these processes need to be more flexible and that the financing bodies need to be strengthened through provision of the resources they need to carry out their task. In this connection  we are deeply concerned at the decision of the Interim Committee of IMF to reduce the annual lending capacity of IMF to 102 per cent of the quota.221. Finally  the delegation of the Dominican Republic  which I have the honour to preside over  wishes to appeal to human conscience  to all those who bear on their shoulders the heavy responsibilities of the destiny of their respective countries  so that given the serious political and economic crisis that threatens the very existence of mankind  wisdom and mutual respect may prevail instead of the violence that generates the worst of evils. This would indubitably promote a better understanding  which would open the doors to co-operation and solidarity among peoples  the supreme objectives of the United Nations."
"43",2039,"DZA",38,1983,"ï»¿165.	Mr. President  your accession to the important post of President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly offers the Algerian delegation and me personally the opportunity to express to you with great pleasure our sincere and warm congratulations. Your experience as a statesman and your highly valued qualities guarantee that this session will proceed  I am sure  in a calm and orderly atmosphere and that it will live up to expectations.166.	Your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  deserved well of the United Nations. He worked lucidly and resolutely in a very difficult international period to affirm still further the role of the Organization and to defend its values and make its voice heard.167.	I should also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General. He is a man of conviction and courage  and the international community offers him its appreciation  gratitude and support for his efforts and initiative.168.	Lastly  I should like to welcome among us the delegation of St. Christopher and Nevis.169.	International relations are going through one of the most critical periods in history. Neither constant repetition of this fact nor the appeal to the community of nations that regularly follows can alter the essential point  namely  that the state of international relations is serious. It is  in fact  extremely disturbing. A crisis with deep and lasting manifestations is darkening the world horizon. Increasing dangers are threatening the future of the human race with insecurity and even making that future uncertain. That situation threatens universal peace and  development. Is it intelligence that is missing? Do we have a feeling of resignation? Have we lost our power of imagination? Are those the obstacles that are preventing mankind from fulfilling its destiny?170.	But mankind is not doomed to wasted effort  to a crumbling of solidarity  to a paralysis of action  in brief  to a division within itself.171.	Indeed the reality of the problems and the scope of the challenges bring us down to the shape of contemporary geopolitical space and to the logic of the relationships of force and unbridled power.172.	The conflicting structure of international relations is at the root of this all-out crisis. Is it a hardened vision of the world or is it a worse scenario?173.	In any case  as events unfold so swiftly we are brought to a split between intention and action  allowing events to determine what ideas prevail. The temptation to gain power thus triumphs over accommodation and confrontation wins out over dialogue.174.	The acute nature of international tension and the revival of antagonistic visions of the world order accompanied by renewed questioning of the all too few achievements of detente all exacerbate the arms race and increase the hotbeds of tension. That makes even more real the desire to split up the third world for geo-strategic purposes through the search for spheres of influence  strong- points and strategic staging posts  among other things.175.	Third-world strugglesâespecially the national liberation movements and efforts for economic developmentâare now seen through the distorting prism of East- West confrontation. Progress in decolonization is being halted or deviated from its natural course. Negotiations on the reduction or limitation of arms falter when they come up against claims for supremacy.176.	The world economic crisis  inseparable from this environment  on which it in turn has an aggravating effect  and with which it constantly interacts  is shedding new light on the deterioration in the present system of international relations. This crisis is preventing growth and jeopardizing development.177.	Thus  just what is at stake becomes clear: it is the very ability of the community of nations to ensure an orderly transition towards a new system of international relations. The stakes are enormous.178.	It is hardly necessary to say that the stability of our world and its prosperity can result only from the far- sighted implementation of strategies that break with those policies that led to the collapse of the old order.179.	We must finally admit and fully recognize that meeting these demands is at the very heart of the problem of how to establish an order based on collective security and on co-operation  harmony and progress among nations.180.	Adversity is the test of strict principles  great works and great designs. It is in time of difficulty that we must affirm our determination and strengthen the ideals of right  justice and peace with which the United Nations is identified. In the conflicts and tensions of today's world the United Nations has a truth to tell  laws to uphold and values to impose. What are they? They mean ensuring that all peoples can exercise their own free judgment  guaranteeing conditions of universal stability and security and  lastlyâand this is inseparable from the precedingâ establishing the new international economic order - which remains the keystone of peace. What are the means to this end? They are orderly political dialogue in good faith.181.	While everything in the current crisis urges us to carry on this dialogue and to join our efforts  demanding of us innovative and courageous vision  the international community seems to be abandoning itself to doubt  mistrust and the most damaging inward-looking tendencies. The inability to communicate prevails. The failure in dialogue intensifies and exacerbates the crisis in relations between States. The acuteness of this crisis and its potential uncontrollable developments shed more light on the interrelationship of problems and the interdependence of nations which today  more than ever before  do indeed have a common fate.182.	In this era of upheavals and perils  the United Nations represents the last refuge for those principles and lofty values that have contributed to the establishment of improved relations between nations. And yet the United Nations is weakened in that very aspect which is the whole essence and force of its reason for existing  namely the prevalence of dialogue over confrontation and the desire to establish a new system of international relations bringing the human race together in an undertaking that is greater than itself. Its primary functions of preserving peace and security and guiding international co-operation for development are  unfortunately  repeatedly set aside.183.	The United Nations system  with its universality and its ideal of democracy in handling common problems and in decision-making  must remain the major framework for our thinking and action. It must remain the holy  inviolate sanctuary for the fundamental principles on which international society is built and for the aims of peace and progress that it has set itself. Paramount among these is to ensure that all peoples have full control of their own destinies. That is indeed the primary role and the first duty of the United Nations.184.	In the Middle East there is a crystallization of the most serious challenge to the fundamental principles of the United Nations: denial of the rights of the Palestinian people  systematic recourse to a policy of force  and attacks on the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Arab States.185.	It is absolutely essential for the United Nations to defuse this challenge and to impose the obligation to abide by the law. This means promoting a just and lasting settlement  including as its central element implementation of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and the fulfilment of its historic aspiration to an independent State. The recent International Conference on the Question of Palestine invited the United Nations to do exactly that. The United Nations must respond and thus live up to the expectations which the international community thus expressed.186.	The only possible solution of the Middle East crisis is a comprehensive settlement. The recognized failure of piecemeal approaches requires that the only path to peace must finally be taken  namely  a solution divorced from the facile temptation merely to give legal colour to the existing balance of relations of force  a solution which holds aloof from the play of circumstance. The participation of the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  is essential in developing this solution.187.	There is little need for me to say once again that the United Nations has an obligation to the Palestinian people and has a duty to promote an overall settlement with proper regard for the security of the Arab States which have suffered aggression  particularly Syria  and ensuring for Lebanon respect for its national unity  territorial integrity and sovereignty. In this connection  it is to be hoped that the recent cease-fire in Lebanon will finally open up the path towards the national consensus which is the only path that can lead to reconciliation in that country and to its reconstruction in concord and harmony.88. The United Nations  which has the historic task of ensuring complete decolonization  has a special responsibility regarding the national aspirations of the Namibian people. The Namibian people are continuing a heroic struggle under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole legitimate representative  and they must see their right to independence triumph. To that end  Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the framework for an ideal settlement on which there is today a genuine international consensus. It is incumbent upon the United Nations to ensure full implementation of that resolution. It must also avert any attempts to distort the process of decolonization in Namibia.189.	Condemnation of the apartheid regime must continue unabated  and collective action to eliminate it and to outlaw it from international society must continue unceasingly. Similarly  there must be outright denunciation of all manifestations of racial oppression  which infringe the most basic human right: the right to live.190.	Lastly  with regard to the front-line States  it is the duty of the international community to show solidarity. The independent existence of those countries is imperilled and their development efforts are being seriously hampered. It is incumbent upon the United Nations to translate expressions of support for them into effective measures and specific actions.191.	A bloody fratricidal conflict is engulfing Chad. Outside interventions have given it dimensions that it would not otherwise have attained. Only if there is an end to such intervention in all its forms and manifestations will the people of Chad be able to decide  without constraint or hindrance  on a settlement of their problem.192.	This Organization must also help in the search for the African solution which the Organization of African Unity [Q/4t/j is striving to promote in order to hasten national reconciliation in that country.193.	With regard to Western Sahara  Africa  in its wisdom and perspicacity  has made the voice of justice heard loud and clear by proclaiming the right of a people to a freely chosen national existence. It is the duty of the United Nations to echo that voice  just as it is its duty to foster the process leading to a solution  the bases for which now exist. In this work for peace the United Nations must give assistance and support to the OAU.194.	In this matter the now clearly identified parties to the conflict and the carefully established means of solution determine the framework for a just and lasting settlement  offering the brother peoples of Morocco and Western Sahara the path to reconciliation and agreement.195.	Africa hopes that the obstacles which have arisen to the implementation of the resolution on Western Sahara adopted at the nineteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity	ânotably  at the last meeting of the Implementation Committee of Heads of State on Western Saharaâwill finally be overcome.196.	Algeria  for its part  true to its principles  is still sincerely and fully ready to work towards that end. We are persuaded that the Greater Arab Maghreb is the perfect setting for such a reconciliation and  in terms of the Western Sahara conflict  provides all the conditions necessary to go beyond this.197.	We believe in the policy of positive good-neighbourliness. We work towards this end with conviction  responsibility and perseverance. Through thisâand this aloneâcan the essential imperatives of stability  security and co-operation be ensured at the regional level  in the interest of all peoples  with respect for the identity and options of each  and for the greater well-being of the community.198.	In Central America the people are experiencing disquieting developments. We place great hope in the commendable initiative of the Contadora Group which is striving responsibly  within the framework of the essential policy of good-neighbourliness  for a negotiated settlement which respects the fundamental wishes of the people of the region. Any settlement of the other crises and conflicts in Asia  Africa and Latin America must conform to these same principles.199.	In the context of a serious international crisis  the United Nations is being put to the test in the consolidation of the structure of peace. This presupposes a system of collective security which recognizes the freedom of peoples and nations  puts an end to spiralling over-armament and  more essentially  rids the international society of power relations that lead to conflicts.200.	It is to the credit of the United Nations that it has helped to bring about a greater awareness of the common terms in which the problems of peace  security and development are couched. The establishment of the new international economic order can thus be analysed as part of a new system of just and democratic international relations  bringing together the independent data of true collective security and international economic co-operation which is new in concept  bases and methods of use. The problems of peace and development come together in a single dynamic leading to the restructuring of the existing order.201.	The crisis of international relations has a forceful impact on the world economic atmosphere. A worldwide  deep-rooted and lasting deterioration is seriously affecting and upsetting the prospects of growth and development in economic terms. While its nature may be challenged or its scale under-estimated  this crisis obliges the international community  and through it the United Nations  to take up the challenge of the organization and management of the welfare of all. The real answer clearly called for by this advanced deterioration in the world economy is still elusive.202.	The recovery alluded to is uncertain  fragile and precarious. How can we believe in these early indications and too hastily decoded signals at a time when there is still contraction in international trade  monetary disorder  protectionist outbursts and a stagnant raw materials and capital market? How can we believe in the viability of this recovery when there is no lasting base or stable foundations sustained by a powerful dynamic which the third world  given the means to develop  could generate and maintain?203.	Furthermore  how can we believe in the lasting power of a recovery when everything suggests that only a structural reshaping of the world's economic framework can ensure for growth and development  in their natural interrelationships  the conditions of their viability?204.	It is time to let go of visions that reduce the present crisis to symptomatic passing disturbances of a mere exhaustion of growth or cyclical indicators of difficulties of a development model. It is high time to get down to the necessary job of revitalizing international cooperation.205.	If we are convinced that to a global challenge we should give a global response  then a new and daring approach must be used. Any delay in defining and implementing it makes ever more distant the prospect of a new upsurge in the world economy and jeopardizes the development effort. This answer must  without any discrimination or arbitrariness  bring together all the conditions for establishing new international relations freed from the burdens and mistakes of the past. This calls for a responsible and action-oriented political dialogue; a political dialogue that  in establishing without complacency a diagnosis of the crisis and judging its proper  recognizes that everything goes back to the qualitative transformation of international relations; a responsible dialogue that  no longer an end in itself  brings together the spheres of the States' decision-making in putting the world economy in order again; an action-oriented dialogue that would be reconciled with the natural mission of being a condition and means of promoting and organizing change.206.	It is to such a dialogue that an appeal for common prosperity was made at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. This appeal expresses the conviction that it is imperative to change international relations in an orderly way and in concert. At the same time  it shows the urgent need to act. This appeal suggests methods and sets out a framework for action. Beginning with a lucid evaluation and imbued with a sense of responsibility  the initiative for restructuring the global negotiations shows a sincere consideration for the concerns of our partners. Because it goes beyond the peripheral problems of organization and procedure  this restructuring allows for discussion and pragmatic decision-making as the negotiating process progresses. It is our hope that the same open mindedness that prompts us will find an echo in the reply we expect from our partners.207.	Need we say also that the scope of the crisis and its fearful effects on the economies of the ever-growing number of developing countries call for the adoption of urgent measures in areas of critical interest for those countries?208.	Need we also mention in such a vital area as finance and currency that action is called for? An international conference that would respect the principle of universality must  through dialogue  endeavour to undertake reform that will be a valid response to the needs of growth and development.209.	A clear and far-sighted stock-taking that acknowledges that the sixth session of the United Nations conference on Trade and Development did not live up to its promise leads us to the problem of restructuring the world economy. The problem is still there. This means that the General Assembly has an even greater responsibility at this session for organizing a discussion that will be faithful to the dimensions of the proposals the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.210.	In this pessimistic climate  there is a glimmer of hope  however. Co-operation among developing countries is being organized and intensified. Since a promising start has been made  it is important not to let it wither. South-South co-operation must become ever more complete and close  resolutely making use of every possibility offered our countries.F211.	In a world facing an uncertain future and prey to doubt when faced with the immensity and overwhelming weight of problems  a new outlook had to emerge. By defining the true causes of that inability to shape the future of mankind and setting forth the conditions for overcoming them  the Non-Aligned Movement will have made its contribution to reviving the ideal of the United Nations.212.	The message of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries demonstrates our deep belief in the ability of the United Nations to unite mankind in its call for a universal order of peace and progress.213.	The Chairman of our Movement  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  the Prime Minister of India  came here and issued  with dignity  a call for collective action commensurate with the seriousness of the times.214.	With international society in upheaval and its very foundations shaken by a crisis of confidence  a crisis of identity  indeed  a crisis of values  non-alignment  identifying itself with the work of the United Nations  is the bearer of a plan for a new era.215.	The plan is far-reaching and will not be easy to achieve. We are aware of this. Difficult  persistent problems and resistance exist  but to the extent that we are imbued with the necessary faith and resolution  our undertaking remains possible and healthy. The United Nations is an act of hope; by adopting this undertaking it will respond to the common aspiration of the well-being of all and will remain faithful to what it stands for. "
"44",2086,"ECU",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 All the countries of the world are suffering the effects of the crisis in the international economy  some more than others  but the 4 billion human beings who inhabit the Earth are affected by its tragic and pernicious consequences.2.	The industrialized nations were the first to feel these effects  towards the end of the '70s  through the difficulties that arose in the monetary system in 1974 and 1975 because of the adjustment of oil prices  and especially since 1979  when their economies became stagnant  with consequences that were immediately felt by all nations. Furthermore  in 1978 the centrally planned countries  which had attained a high rate of growth up to the first part of the 1970s  also began to suffer from an economic crisis. The countries of the third world have been enduring a similar fate since 1981  with the stagnation and deterioration of the relative degree of development they had attained in recent years  a phenomenon which has not spared even the oil-exporting nations or recently industrialized nations.3.	How has it been possible for a phenomenon of such unprecedented scope to have affected all nations  whatever their resources  the efficiency of their rulers and administrators  the economic model they follow or their existing political system? What is the explanation for the sudden paralysis in a development process which was considered to be limitless? Was it not thought that multinational corporations  free from ""negative political controls"" and possessing the highest degree of technology  were the best means for distributing development throughout the world? Was it not thought that the degree of modernization attained through public policies of industrialized nations  capitalist as well as socialist  ensured that they would rapidly bring about such a result? How could the experts of the financial transnational make such glaring mistakes? How is it that the international co-operation systems and agencies  largely set up in order to avoid crises  are incapable of achieving the aims for which they were established?4.	But I have not come here in order to absolve the nations of the third world from any responsibility  not even my own nation. We are aware of the mistakes we have made  as well as of our weaknesses  which have also helped to cause the problems we face today. But our contributions to world development should not be forgotten. In the last 13 years  developing economies have attained higher rates of growth than the industrialized nations and the economic crisis reached our countries later  which proves the impact of outside factors. Some nations began to export manufactures. Latin American nations made progress  as did oil-exporting countries. To this must be added our contribution in food  raw materials  energy sources  financial resources due to the flight of capital and workers  who today remain unemployed in the countries of the North. But the crisis which began in the industrialized nations has offset the modest progress achieved through so much effort  with the result that today the third world is beset by serious economic imbalances which in some cases are becoming chaotic.5.	Much has been said about the origins of the crisis  but often only the most immediate causes are mentioned: higher oil prices and interest rates  discrepancies between economic and social policies  stagnation in productivity  irrational decisions by the business sectors and the fall in world trade. No doubt that analysis is correct and has been useful; nevertheless I believe the present phenomenon is more complex and more significant than that  and consequently it cannot be dealt with properly by an analysis of merely circumstantial factors. In other words  it is my view that we are faced with an unprecedented structural phenomenon  which calls into question the bases on which the post-war world economy was organized. Since today's crisis is not of a traditional type  it may well be asked if it can be resolved within the framework of the traditional structures now in place.6.	I should like to make some comments here. Military expenditures have resulted in the diversion of vast sums from genuinely productive activities and from pressing social problems. Furthermore  in the present state of military technology and exploitation of the material resources of the planet  wars do not add to the wealth of the world economy  but rather destroy what there is. Major investments devoted to the use of atomic energy  to space exploration and to scientific research have done little to invigorate productive activities in the short term. Transnational corporations bypass national sovereignty  and they lack vision and interest in economic and social development. Oligopolistic control of technology has prevented this sector from being included among the needs and problems of the third world and might even be a new element acting against it. International organizations  controlled or bypassed by the major Powers  have less and less influence on international relations and the direction of economic activity. The remarkable economic expansion of recent years seems to have lacked the basis necessary to ensure its continuity and a system to control and guide it.7.	Getting ahead of history and foreseeing the economic events we now witness today  in the mid-1970s the General Assembly adopted a programme of action for restructuring international economic relations through the establishment of a new international economic order. Later on  the General Assembly decided to undertake what was termed global negotiations in the areas of commodities  energy  monetary and financial problems  trade and development. At present both initiatives are at a standstill  and it is not an exaggeration to say that so far at least they have failed. The same could be said about the Cancun meeting ' which was guided by the lucid report of the Brandt Commission and the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. In view of these frustrating facts  pessimism is rampant and many wonder whether these initiatives have any meaning in practice  whether any positive results are to be expected of them and whether the industrialized countries  over and above their always generous statements of good intent  are truly interested in shouldering the essential responsibility which they bear for the development of the third world.8.	But if the principles of international policy defined in the Charter of the United Nations  its initiatives and proposals regarding the search for agreement and the enlightened analysis and thorough study of social and economic development in the world have not been sufficient to lead us to think deeply  the serious events which beset all nations today should do this. In this context  the economic crisis in Latin America today is a good example.9.	After three decades of continuous growth  Latin America and the Caribbean are probably immersed in the deepest depression of the century. Although the United Nations Development Decade has only recently come to an end  our peoples are not only still far from attaining its purpose  but are going through a process of social involution caused by a decline in their economies. Inflation  which in 1983 may well reach three figures  and the rising level of unemployment and underemployment are seriously affecting standards of living at the lower and intermediate levels. There are nations in which the scourge of hunger has appearedâsomething which was not believed possible in the region. Social conflicts are worsening and political stability is becoming increasingly vulnerable  with obvious consequences for the frequently proclaimed need for hemispheric security  which today is economic and social in nature  above all  and not military  as some believe.10.	In facing the crisis Latin American countries have shouldered their responsibilities. Almost all of them have developed adjustment policies aimed at cutting the deficits of their external and fiscal sectors. But the results have been harmful in terms of income distribution and economic growth  which in almost all countries of the region today is negative. It must be remembered that austerity programmes are bearable only if they are temporary  if they are kept within certain limits and if they offer real possibilities for overcoming the problems. But  despite the major sacrifices made by our peoples  we do not see any evidence that the recovery of the continent may have begun. The reason for this is that the international factors which gave rise to the crisis still exist  to which we should add the floods and the drought which exacerbated the economic problems of some countries of the region.11.	In the final declaration of the Williamsburg Summit the industrialized nations recognized that the ""weight of the recession has fallen very heavily on developing countries"" and said that they were ""deeply concerned about their recovery"". They thus recommended that certain measures be adoptedâ-infer the opening of their markets and the re-establishment of the flow of resources and official aid.12.	In this case  as in many others  there is a gap between words and actions. The deterioration in international trade continues. The fall in the value of commodities has been so great that some of them are at levels below those of 1930. The protectionism of the industrialized nations takes a wide variety of forms and is reaching inadmissible limits. In 1982 Latin America received less than half the net inflow of capital that it had received the previous year  and it is expected that the amount will be still lower in 1983. In the last 12 months some countries have not had a single loan from international banking  and those that have had loans have got barely enough to make their overdue payments and service their debts  much less finance their development. In some cases the scarcity of foreign exchange is so great that some nations cannot even acquire essential raw materials and foodstuffs. The high interest rates charged by the creditor banks make it extremely difficult to renegotiate the debt.13.	The so-called Group of Seven believes that the recovery of their economies is the best incentive for the reactivation of the economies of the less developed countries. It is no doubt essential for Latin America that the recovery in North America be consolidated and extended to other industrialized nations. But even if these optimistic forecasts prove to be right  it will probably take more than a year for the effects to be felt  and the delay will aggravate the difficulties of the region. Furthermore  if the problem of the debt remains unsolved and the present stagnation continues  the recovery of the industrialized nations might not occur to the extent desired. If that happens  we may well be faced with a collapse of the world economy.14.	It has been stated that in order to revitalize growth there must be no increase in oil prices or interest rates. The former condition has been achieved at a cost to the oil-exporting countries  which are suffering today from serious economic problems. With regard to the latter condition  the situation is uncertain and one wonders whether high interest rates have not been mot e to blame for today's crisis. It is true that nominal interest rates have fallen  but real interest rates remain high because of the high margins charged by creditor banks and because of a drop in inflation in the industrialized countries.15.	We are faced with a serious economic problem which has exceeded the ability of any State to solve on its own and before which the traditional standards for action of the international co-operation agencies have proved inadequate and have become markedly political in character. The United Nations is the highest world political body and the Organization was established precisely to deal with this kind of problem. As this is the first time a President of Ecuador has had the great honour of addressing the General Assembly  I have chosen to refer to a problem which is of vital importance to all nations.16.	Interdependence is one of the factors characterizing the second half of the twentieth century. If national political conflicts or localized wars place world peace at risk  how will it not be threatened when all nations and their peoples suffer from a social upheaval hitherto unknown to those who inhabit the planet today and to which we cannot see a possible solution? Awareness of these risks and the conviction that international co-operation and multilateralismâwhich are so underestimatedâare today more than ever essential has led me to request of two regional agencies  the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Latin American Economic System  that they develop a programme of action for Latin America and the Caribbean in order to deal with the crisis. In order to study this  the personal representatives of the heads of State of the region met in the capital of my country and at Santo Domingo. In January an economic conference will be held at Quito to adopt it. Latin America wishes thus to contribute to the quest for a shared response by all of us who must deal with a solution to the crisis: the countries of the South and of the North  agencies of international co-operation and international banking.17.	To this end  the costs of the adjustment must be fairly distributed among all the parties concerned and not only among third world nations  which has been the case up to now. It must be borne in mind that the indebtedness was due to the permissiveness of international banking  which resorted to every possible means to place its surpluses and through pressure converted them to short-term debts. These operations have yielded excellent profits. Thus  for example  it is estimated that almost half of the 1982 profits of the ten largest North American banks derived from their international operations. With regard to the industrialized nations  the recovery of the third world is in their interest since the contraction of its imports is having a negative impact on the economic recovery of the North. They must therefore honour their commitment to increase their quotas in IMF and use their influence in this body  as well as in the World Bank and in others  to ensure that their decisions and programmes are adequate to meet the challenges of the crisis. Renegotiation agreements must take into account each country's actual ability to pay  which depends on the volume and value of its exports. Public financing must cover part of the credit which used to come from private banks. Above all  interest rates must return to their levels of the previous decade. We must not forget that mankind is sailing in a fragile ship which may well founder if we do not all join together to keep it afloat. If it does go down  it could take everyone with it. That others may ignore this risk is explicable  but it would be unpardonable for us  who are in government  to disregard it.18.	Greater still is the tragedy of peoples who are not only suffering from the economic crisis but also from the scourge of war often visited upon them by extraneous forces. My country has witnessed with much distress the Central American conflict generated by the authoritarian and exploitative regimes which held sway in the region  a conflict which today is promoted by foreign intervention intent on ending the East-West conflict. Ecuador once again reiterates its support for the Contadora Group and makes a fervent appeal to all parties concerned to cooperate with the Group. There can be no further talk of peace in Central America with weapons in hand. For so long the only language heard has been that of weapons  and the time has come for the voice of the people to be heard.19.	Ecuador has maintained  and will continue to advocate  the imperative need for an end to colonial intervention in the Malvinas Islands; for the withdrawal of foreign troops operating in Afghanistan  Lebanon  Cyprus  Kampuchea  Namibia  Chad and other areas; for an end to the cruel military conflict between Iran and Iraq; and for a negotiated solution for the problems of the Middle East  in particular of the Palestinian people.20.	For the good of mankind the arms race must cease  especially that of the major Powers  and the threat of a nuclear holocaust must end. After having lived through a promising state of detente in recent years  we now find ourselves in the midst of a political and military confrontation whose consequences might be more serious than those of the cold war. People everywhere are duty-bound to defend peace  whether they come from the East  the West or the third world. A return to dialogue and sanity is  above all  a responsibility of the major Powers.21.	The United Nations must continue to preserve international peace and security and promote the peaceful settlement of existing disputes in accordance with its principles  which do not recognize the use of force  territorial conquest or the occupation of territory  and on the basis of reason and justice.22.	In the American continent there are problems which are harmful to peace  security  co-operation and development  such as the territorial claim by Ecuador in the area of the Amazon  which must be resolved for the common good of two peoples that wish to live in peace within a framework of fruitful co-operation.23.	After one of the longest periods of dictatorship in its history  on 10 August 1979  thanks to the will of the Ecuadorian people and the co-operation of its armed forces  a democratic system was re-established in my country. A month ago I began my last year in government  during which democratic institutions have been consolidated with full observance of public freedoms and human rights and with attention to social needs  especially those of farmers and the poorest  despite the economic crisis which has also affected my country. Our citizens are now preparing for the election next year of new rulers and parliamentary leaders. With this background information and in the name of Ecuadorian democracy  I wish to express my sincere desire that all peoples of the world may live in freedom.24.	My country  which was one of the founders of the United Nations and has always remained loyal to its principles  will continue to support it. We consider the Organization to be an essential instrument for the preservation of peace and the promotion of development. It is my hope that this tragic year in which peace has been violated on all continents  not only by violence and war but also by serious economic and social problems  will see the opening of a path along which the peoples of the third world and the countries of the North will find the necessary common response to the critical situations which weigh so heavily on the future of mankind.25.	As a representative of the people of my country and in compliance with the resolution adopted at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983  it has been a high honour for the President of Ecuador to come to this forum of peace and address the representatives of all the nations of the Earth. "
"45",2131,"EGY",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 It is my pleasure to address  in the name of Egypt  this solemn gathering of heads of State and representatives of nations in this Hall  which is the forum for peace  justice and right and the symbol of the consensus of the international community on the noble objectives and lofty principles guiding relations between States and peoples.2.	I congratulate the people and Government of Saint Christopher and Nevis on attaining national independence and their admission to membership in the United Nations  and on behalf of the people and Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt I wish them prosperity and progress.3.	I also wish to extend to you  Sir  and to your friendly country  Panama  my congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly during this important session  which witnesses an active move by the international community to face up to political and economic issues endangering international security and prosperity both now and in the future.4.	In the present circumstances  it is of the utmost significance to underline the necessity of strengthening the United Nations and consolidating its role in maintaining international peace and security  of enhancing its effectiveness and capability in contributing to the peaceful settlement of international disputes  and of urging all States to abide by the rule of law in their policies and dealings.5.	In his report on the work of the Organization in 1982 ' the Secretary-General stated:""I believe therefore that an important first step would be a conscious recommitment by Governments to the Charter.""Certainly we have strayed far from the Charter in recent years. Governments that believe they can win an international objective by force are often quite ready to do so  and domestic opinion not infrequently applauds such a course. The Security Council  the primary organ of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security  all too often finds itself unable to take decisive action to resolve international conflicts and its resolutions are increasingly defied or ignored by those that feel themselves strong enough to do so. Too frequently the Council seems powerless to generate the support and influence to ensure that its decisions are respected  even when these are taken unanimously. Thus the process of peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed in the Charter is often brushed aside.""6.	Egypt considers that the international situation requires a serious pause and a dynamic approach that transcends the traditional outlook which has bridled our movements since the Second World War. An objective reassessment of the contemporary international system and a search for an optimum remedy of its deficiencies are strongly warranted by the prevailing circumstances. The early convening of a special session to consider this issue in all its aspects would be timely and appropriate.7.	In our view  the issue is not the performance or the effectiveness of the Organization or its principal organs. The issue is basically and primarily related to the overall international situation  the role of the great Powers  their special responsibilities  the policies they pursue and the interests they represent.8.	The issue involves certain countries' international behaviour and disregard for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  their deviation from the rule of law and their tendency to resort to the use of force to attain political and economic gains  thus undermining the basis of the post-World-War international system.9.	Highest on our agenda is the elimination of the threat of nuclear war  a subject which should be accorded the greatest attention. Such a war could annihilate human civilization and achievements since the dawn of history; there would be no victors or vanquished; mankind would forfeit its past  present and future. We should therefore redouble our efforts to prevent such a thing from happening  wherever we are geographically situated and whatever are our political or ideological persuasions. It is also incumbent upon both super-Powers  in particular  to exert further efforts successfully to conclude the nuclear disarmament talks at Geneva  notwithstanding the increasing bilateral tensions caused by other issues. The destiny of us all is in the balance.10.	My country was among the very first of those that were particularly conscious of the necessity of nuclear disarmament. Our deep awareness of this fact took shape both in our long-standing support for the principles of nuclear non-proliferation and in our accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  as well as in the devotion of our efforts to peaceful uses of nuclear energy in furtherance of the objectives of economic development. A case in point is that the call for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was an Egyptian initiative.11.	The issue of general and complete disarmament cannot be ignored. The spiralling production of conventional weapons and their use constitute a serious threat to the security of many medium-sized and small countries and an onerous burden upon their economies. It suffices to point out here that the world expenditure on armaments in 1982 exceeded $650 billionâwhich equals the revenue of 2 billion people living in the 50 poorest countries on our planet. Any effort to achieve complete and general disarmament should stem from an appreciation of the interrelationship between disarmament  international security and development.12.	This session of the General Assembly is taking place in the midst of a highly acute international economic crisis reminiscent of the great depression suffered by the world during the thirties  which led to lower world production  deteriorating terms of trade  an imbalance in the international monetary system  higher rates of unemployment and a disequilibrium in the relationships between developed and industrialized countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other. The economies of some of the least developed countries suffered from negative development rates of growth that fell far short of the most basic subsistence needs of their populations.13.	It has become clear that the debt problem of the developing countries is one of the major problems confronting us  as these debts have risen to more than $700 billion  with an annual average of debt-servicing surpassing $120 billion  as a result of the reduction in the prices of raw materials produced by those countries totalling 30 per cent during the past two years  as well as the feverish increase in interest rates and the prices of finished products. Consequently  negative repercussions will adversely affect social and economic development efforts in the developing countries.14.	On the other hand  we should be fully aware of the necessity of introducing structural changes in the existing international monetary  financing and trading systems in view of their inability to cope with the problems now plaguing the world economy even though they functioned actively for a quarter of a century after the Second World War.15.	Allow me to present here a general outline which could contribute to strengthening our ability to deal with such problems.16.	First  the United Nations  which since its inception has assumed a major responsibility in the establishment of economic co-operation among States  could still play a pivotal role in remedying the present international crisis  a role which would transcend its role in resolving political disputes. Therefore  we pinned great hopes on the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983. We expressed those hopes in the document issued at the Buenos Aires meeting of the Group of 77.2 Unfortunately  the outcome did not live up to expectations in the three major areas of raw materials and trade  commodities and services  and monetary and financial issues. Prompted by those considerations  we welcomed the initiative of Mrs. Indira Gandhi  Prime Minister of India an Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  to hold a number of meetings with heads of State and Government under the auspices of the United Nations during the present session. This would generate new momentum in the North-South dialogue and in the preparations for launching global negotiations in accordance with the approach agreed upon at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983.17.	Secondly  the point of departure in resolving these economic problems should be an acknowledgement of the close interdependence between the developing and the developed countries. We are all in the same boat  producer and consumer  debtor and creditor  rich and poor. Any contradiction in our economic interests is of secondary  transient importance. Unless efforts are pooled and geared to confront such a crisis  all of us will suffer from its dire consequences and its destructive effects. For the era in which we live is one of interdependence. No country  no matter how strong or rich  can afford to live in isolation from the condition under which others suffer. Consequently  the North-South dialogue should be conducted in a spirit of co-operation and solidarity  not in a spirit of discord and contradiction. Our approach should be an objective one  based on a global view and unaffected by parochial or selfish attitudes adopted solely to extract the maximum advantage at the expense of others. Such concepts are outmoded  given the realities of our age.18.	Thirdly  the developing countries can set an example by devising an integrated approach to co-operation amongst themselves  which would in itself be a complementary step towards North-South co-operation. Egypt  which in July 1962 was host to the first conference of developing countries to consider issues of common interest  is profoundly convinced of the necessity for cooperation among countries of the South and is ready to initiate further steps in that direction. In this respect  representatives might have followed the process of integration between Sudan and Egypt  which opens new realms in the development efforts of two countries joined together by close cultural bonds  common economic interests and deep mutual sentiments.19.	Fourthly  the situation is of such urgency that generalized recommendations or loose slogans would be wasteful. We have wasted too much time on generalities and good intentions. We should now move on to committing ourselves to specific steps which would guide our future actions. Allow me to propose the following steps as a beginning: first  developed countries should attain the goals and objectives of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade by allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for development aid  to be raised to 1 per cent by 1990; next  there should be an increase in the resources of IMF through raising quotas and facilitating access by developing countries to its credit facilities  improving credit terms and exploring new methods to distribute special drawing rights in support of the development process; then there should be an increase in the resources of the World Bank and an expansion of its programmes of credit to developing countries; and lastly  we should adopt a collective approach to solve the debt problem of the developing countries in order to forestall paralysis of the inter-governmental and private financial institutions  which would lead to the disintegration of the world economy  thus disappointing the aspirations of the peoples of the third world for better times.20.	Situated in the heart of the Arab world in the north-eastern part of Africa  thus providing a link with Asia  and lying on the southern shores of the Mediterranean  which links Africa and Europe  Egypt duly recognizes the importance of issues of security and peace in all those regions.21.	Egypt's concern has been manifested in its various initiatives aimed at establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East  the denuclearization of Africa and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East  as well as in its support for the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. Egypt has worked tirelessly for closer co-operation and interaction among the peoples of the Mediterranean.22.	The key to peace in the Middle East lies in reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian problem based on recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self- determination and on enabling that people to establish their national entity on their soil  as well as on the recognition of Israel's right to exist  and on agreement on security guarantees for both parties  leading to a new era of relations between Israel and all its neighbours. This should lead to the elimination of war and destruction  paving the way to friendliness and harmony instead of rancour and hatred. Resources would be released for industry and agriculture instead of being used for stockpiling deadly weapons and imperilling the lives of whole generations in an area that was once the cradle of civilization  refined culture and peace.23.	Most regrettably  Israeli practices in the occupied Arab territories are in total contradiction with the goal of peace and reconciliation. Such practices can yield only a crop of hatred and fresh impediments to the course of peace  destroying whatever hope is left in the hearts of millions. The first of these practices is the Israeli policy of establishing settlements in the West Bank  Gaza and the Golan Heights  a policy that is assuming new dimensions daily in defiance of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and in contravention of the rules of international law and international treaties  including the Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention of 19073 and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12 August 1949/ as well as the commitment undertaken by Israel on the very day that the framework for peace in the Middle East was signed.24.	In such conditions  we should all think together about new ways and means of confronting this perilous policy  which threatens to undermine the very foundations of peace and make any Arab-Israeli coexistence impossible. It is quite evident that coexistence cannot be reconciled with a policy of territorial annexation and violation of rights. We are all urged to explore new measures with regard to this illegal policy  having established that it contravenes the rules of law and is totally inadmissible. A policy based on illegality remains illegitimate; a policy of fait accompli cannot legitimize itself in the eyes of the international community at the end of the twentieth century.25.	Representatives have no doubt followed the recent repressive Israeli actions in the occupied Arab territories: the expulsion of elected mayors and local administration officials and the stifling of peaceful expressions of views and grievances. These practices are added to the existing accumulation  destroying opportunities for genuine peace based on mutual acceptance and good faith.26.	Allow me to address an appeal from this rostrum to the Israeli people to respond to the challenge of peace  to reject concepts of expansion and territorial annexation and to give concrete expression to its desire for coexistence with the Palestinian people. A golden opportunity exists for Israel to achieve true peace  transforming its borders with the Arabs into areas of attraction  interaction and fruitful exchanges. These borders should no longer be marked by trenches  barbed wire and barricades. We are all called upon to work for a historic reconciliation. We cannot proceed towards the future saddled with the antiquated notions and residues of the past. It is impermissible for any party to try to impose peace because such a peace would be no more than an armed truce  an invitation to revenge and a source of future bloodshed  violence and hostility.27.	We have all witnessed in agony and sorrow the painful and bloody events in Lebanon  the obliteration of the traditional character of the country  the murder of its citizens and the destruction of their property. The country's national unity and territorial integrity have been compromised and its social peace undermined  while it has become a vulnerable target of foreign intervention  plots and dissension. It is the obligation of all of us to stand by the Lebanese people in its efforts to change this painful reality and its determination to play a constructive role in the region.28.	The point of departure in confronting the situation and preventing further deterioration is total Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. Such withdrawal should not be contingent upon factors beyond the control of Lebanon. Israel's obligation to withdraw stems from the illegality of invasion and the provisions of Security Council resolution 509 (1982)  as well as from Israel's commitment to pursue comprehensive peace with all its neighbours who are willing to live in peace and refrain from the use of force in settling disputes.29.	The Arab Republic of Egypt  while welcoming the cease-fire agreement reached in Lebanon  calls upon all parties to respect the sovereignty of Lebanon and its legitimate authority. It also calls for national reconciliation among all the factions in Lebanon. We are determined that all forms of foreign intervention should be terminated and that all plans to partition Lebanon and turn it into spheres of influence and control must be rejected. An independent and unified Lebanon would be a force for peace  stability and progress and a viable model for creative coexistence based on unity in diversity. Therefore  the safeguarding of Lebanon is a moral imperative for all of us.30.	The international community  which members of this Assembly represent  is called upon to exert concerted efforts to put an end to the Iran-Iraq war  which is an aimless and meaningless war. Its continuance spells the death of thousands more citizens in both countries  which are bound together by spiritual and cultural ties  and further dissipation of the resources which should be diverted to their reconstruction and development. Furthermore  its continuance means more tension and more instability for the strategic Gulf area and provides a pretext for more foreign intervention and ambitions.31.	We are not asked to take sides  but we should adopt a clear and unequivocal stand: the war must be stopped and peace must be established. The situation warrants no more indifference  no more waiting for events to unfold until the two warring parties have been exhausted. All of us have a direct interest in seeing to it that the fighting stops and reconstruction begins.32.	In our view  Iraq honoured its legal and moral obligations when it withdrew from all Iranian territory  declared its willingness to end the war forthwith  accepted the border agreement of 1975 and welcomed negotiations to settle disputes. What remains is for Iran to respond to that constructive position and for the international community to determine its position in the light of those facts. Only then will the war mongers realize that they are gaining nothing by continuing the war and that their position is becoming weaker and more self-destructive. This war obviously benefits no one.33.	As the African peoples are engaged in a heroic struggle to rid themselves of the residues of colonialism  as they prepare to take off towards a future of wider horizons through the absorption of modem science and technology and the modernization of their production methods  as they strive to overcome the scourge of drought  malnutrition  economic imbalance caused by the deteriorating terms of trade and the rising prices of imports  we find precious parts of the continent subject to flagrant violations of human rights at the hands of a minority racist regime  a regime which monopolizes power and wealth leaving the majorityâthe rightful sovereign owners of the landâsubjected to ugly repression. Meanwhile  the Pretoria regime continues its aggression against the struggling peoples of southern Africa. That regime persists in its illegal occupation of Namibia  plundering its resources and launching aggression against the front-line States because of their support for our African brothers in the south.34.	It is with much regret that we note that successive resolutions of the Security Council have not made any dent in the conduct of the minority regime  which continues to usurp power by means of force. That situation is truly intolerable; it reflects contempt for the international community and the flouting of its laws and standards. It furthermore diminishes the prestige and standing of the United Nations. Therefore  we must all step up our efforts against those aggressive practices. Our responsibility does not end with the adoption of resolutions and appeals. We should ensure the implementation of the resolutions adopted in order to safeguard the people's rights to freedom  justice and dignity.35.	Another issue that should command our attention is the situation arising from the foreign intervention in Chad  with its repercussions on the peace  security and stability of the area  the killing of innocent civilians  the revival of the outmoded concepts of spheres of influence and the use of the fact accompli and attempts at partition and fragmentation. The situation poses a grave threat to the interests of the African peoples. It violates their consensus on safeguarding their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We pledge our support to the efforts of the Organization of African Unity to put an end to foreign intervention in Chad and to enable its people to direct their energies to the challenge of reform and reconstruction.36.	By the same token  we cannot afford to overlook the existing problems in Asia and Latin America  particularly the question of the peaceful unification of Korea  the situation in Kampuchea  the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan  the dispute over the Falkland Islands and the escalating tension in Central America. We cannot afford the luxury of standing aloof from those events. Those events affect us; we suffer from their consequences regardless of the geographic distances separating us.37.	We stand today at the crossroads. The choice is obvious: either we enjoy a comprehensive peace based on justice under which all nations and peoples could live  or we suffer from chaos  denial of rights and lawlessness.38.	The only course open to us is to double our efforts so that we can nurture the tree of freedom  hoist the banners of peace and build for progress.39.	We have to proceed together on the path of equity and virtue. There is no real conflict of interest between nations of the North and those of the South or between East and West. The only contradiction is between life and death  between existence and extinction and between war and peace. "
"46",2201,"ESP",38,1983,"ï»¿204.	 First of all  I should like to express our sincerest congratulations to Mr. Jorge Illueca on his election and my delegation's great satisfaction at seeing a distinguished representative of the beloved sister nation of Panama occupying the presidency of this session of the Assembly. His well-known gifts as a statesman and his profound experience and knowledge of the United Nations lead us to entertain great hopes for a fruitful outcome of our work. In extending the full co-operation of the Spanish delegation to him  I can assure him that this year our co-operation will be extended with particular pleasure.205.	I should also like to extend our congratulations and thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Hollai  for the great dedication and skill with which he led the work of the last session of the Assembly.206.	To the Secretary-General  an outstanding son of a sister State  Peru  I am pleased to repeat our sentiments of affection for him and of confidence in and satisfaction for the outstanding task he has been performing through some particularly difficult times as head of the Secretariat.207.	To the youngest Member of the United Nations  Saint Christopher and Nevisâto which we are linked by an intimate historic event  an expedition of the Spanish Crown under Admiral Christopher Columbus  who  coming from the old continent  set foot there for the first time in 1493âwe extend our warm welcome and wish it a prosperous life as an independent State.208.	The Spanish Socialist Government  constituted after the elections in October 1982  has set as one of its fundamental objectives the development of a foreign policy in keeping with the new structure of Spanish society and the renewed faith in Spanish democracy. So far as foreign policy is concerned  the new Government's programme is in keeping with the objectives of the United Nations. By defending the purposes and principles of the United Nations we wish to contribute to the consolidation of the democratic values in our country and  at the same time  to the task of promoting faith in the ideals which inspired the Charterâa faith which has not been lost but which must be translated into concrete actions in a world plagued by tensions.209.	Spain wishes to take part in the task of attaining a more secure and just international orderâtwo objectives that deserve our full support but which are not always easily compatible. The first compels us to give continuous support to the cause of detente and disarmament. The second allies us with efforts for a new international economic order and a better world which respects human rights and duly appreciates the quality of our lives and environment. Only thus can we make an effective contribution to peace.210.	In recent years  in this very forum  many voices have been raised to condemn the grave climate of tension on the international scene. This year it cannot be denied that the situation is even worse. The utterly despicable shooting down of a South Korean civil aircraft by the Soviet Union has made clear the fragility of the armed peace on which today's international relations are based and has shown clearly how close we are to the point of no return. However  we cannot allow ourselves to lose hope; rather  we must do everything we can to revive the process of detente.211.	In recent years the East-West conflict has been reduced to its strictly military aspects  with risks of undue simplification and over dependence on technological imperatives.212.	My country considers it urgent to restore priority to political factors  which are the factors that can restore common sense in international relations. Hence we have been making stalwart efforts in recent months  within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  to keep open the channels for dialogue and to keep alive the possibility of compromise.213.	A few days ago the countries which signed the Final Act of Helsinki in 1975took an important step in this direction at Madrid. Despite the very serious problems  the 35 States which signed the Concluding Document of the Madrid meeting after three years of hope and hard effort have shown our determination to keep alight the ideals of peace  security and co-operation which we all share and all need  whatever differences may separate us.214.	Spain has always taken a sincere interest in any proposal to control and reduce the present level of armaments  which is dangerously high and outrageously expensive. We are therefore determined to redouble our efforts and to work imaginatively in all forums dealing with the question of the reduction of conventional and nuclear arsenals. We are convinced that it is possible to reach a balance at a lower level of armaments without thereby endangering the legitimate security interests of each State.215.	We wish also to reiterate the need for a total nuclear test-ban treaty  which would undoubtedly be an effective obstacle to the quantitative and qualitative development of nuclear weapons.216.	On the other hand  Spain has been following with particular attention the negotiations on intermediate- range nuclear forces and the strategic arms reduction talks. Our interest is inevitable  since our country is situated in the continent with the greatest stockpiles of nuclear weapons. Similarly  we have been following with renewed hope the preparatory work for the European disarmament conference. We trust that at that conference it will be possible to make decisive progress towards the reduction of tension in Europe.217.	These concerns  doubtless shared by nearly all of us  are the reflection of the growing and legitimate anxiety of our citizens  who are opposed to living on the brink of the abyss. As I had occasion to say at the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the least we can offer in the short term to the young people who are yearning for peace and developing a new  world-wide patriotism is the prospect of non- confrontation  in which visible and practical steps can be taken to avoid the causes of conflicts and reduce the means of destruction.218.	Spain considers that detente is not enough to attain lasting peace  nor are the efforts to limit and control weapons. We must realize that we have to seek out the deep roots of the conflicts which have been bedevilling international society  because only if we have a fairer and freer world can we have a safer world.219.	Hence the capital importance which the Spanish Government attaches to the defence of human rights and the establishment of effective machinery to guarantee their protection. My country has made the defence of that principle a cardinal point in our own society  and we are continuing to refine the high standards set in this respect in our Constitution.220.	Furthermore  Spain  which is already a party to the main international conventions on human rights  hopes shortly to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and we have gone a long way with the procedures for accepting article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  and also for acceding to the Optional Protocol to that Covenant.221.	Our domestic policy is accompanied by a determined and punctilious foreign policy  since we believe that it is clearly established in the United Nations that the systematic violations of human rights are not covered by Article 2  paragraph 7  of the Charter and that  accordingly  intervention in this field cannot be regarded as interference in the internal affairs of another State.222.	Spain does not share the selective criteria which this Organization often uses to condemn violations of human rights. However  we cannot hide the fact that the people and Government of Spain are particularly disturbed by those situations which have produced enormous numbers of deaths and disappearances and of people sent into exile or imprisoned for their political ideals in countries to which we are closely bound by ties of history  culture and blood.223.	I would like to emphasize that as far as we are concerned civil and political rights and economic  social and cultural rights form an inseparable whole and that it is necessary to protect both individuals and peoples against violation of any of these rights. We cannot accept the argument that a given level of economic and social development must be attained before torture or arbitrary arrest can be dispensed with. Conversely  there is little point in having theoretical enjoyment of public freedoms when poverty and ignorance prevent not merely the full exercise of such rights but even the satisfaction of the most fundamental human needs.224.	Spain  which next year will become a member of the Commission on Human Rights  intends to co-operate in the hope that the Commission may become an increasingly effective body  performing a task to which we attach special importance at a time when we need to reduce international tension.225.	In this connection  I should like to reiterate my country's constant concern at the persistence of the apartheid regime. This is undoubtedly one of the most hateful systems of massive violation of human rights and a threat to peace and stability in southern Africa.226.	We are aware that only a fairer and more balanced economic and social order can guarantee peace.227.	After the two severe recessions of the past 10 years the world economy remains at a low level of activity and unemployment has become an economic scourge and the source of personal frustration for millions and millions of people. The contraction of the world market  neo- protectionist measures and high rates of interest in certain countries have hampered the recovery of the economies of both developed and developing nations.228.	For more than two thirds of mankind  stagnation  unemployment and poverty are not passing phenomena; rather they stem from the very structure of international economic relations. Furthermore  the least developed countries have suffered dramatic effects from the world economic crisis.229.	Recently the Brandt Commission  in its second report  has added its voice to the many publicizing the need for structural changes in North-South relations.230.	It is true that there are many powerful reasons for pessimism  since up to nowâand the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was the latest example of thisâdiscussions of the question have not borne any substantial fruit  while the imbalance between rich and poor countries continues to worsen and the urgent need for change becomes daily more obvious.231.	However  if the signs of economic recovery are confirmed and if political determination  which today is conspicuous by its absence  does emerge  the next few months may provide favourable opportunities for countries of the North and South to find flexible and pragmatic ways of establishing a true dialogue and  more specifically  of setting in motion the process of global negotiations in a United Nations framework.232.	Spain supports the creation of a more just international order. Just as we wish to become a factor for detente in East-West relations  we intend our foreign policy to favour the restructuring of North-South relations. In this respect we think that our country is particularly well qualified  given both its intermediate level of economic development and its special political and cultural ties with broad regions of the developing world. The Government to which I belong intends to increase progressively its bilateral and multilateral development assistance and is preparing new legislation on international co-operation.233.	Within this framework of peace  freedom and progress  we wish to set forth the specific aims of Spain's foreign policy.234.	My Government has unequivocally reaffirmed Spain's membership in the Western world  but this does not rule out our seeking a broad margin of autonomy which would prevent our automatic alignment with interests which may not coincide with our own. This is logical  since Spain  for reasons of geography and history  has special interests and aspirations which are a source of both distinction and enrichment.235.	The Spanish Government wishes to co-operate fully in reducing tension and international conflicts  while not upsetting the delicate balance on which relations between blocs are often based. Therefore  it maintains a stand of firm co-operation within the alliance to which Spain belongs. At the same time  in accordance with an electoral programme supported by the broad majority of our people  it has started a thorough study of the possible forms its contribution to the West's defence could take. That contribution could take various forms  and that question will be decided in due course by the Spanish people.236.	We also reaffirm the European basis of our foreign policy. With the continuation and  we hope  the final conclusion of negotiations on membership of the communities  we wish to contribute to the task of building a Europe  an entity which will have meaning only if the political ideas which gave it birth prevail over immediate economic problems.237.	Our policy is also intended to strengthen relations with the countries closest to us historically and geographically. To begin with our African neighbours  I wish to state that we view with great satisfaction the process of rapprochement in the Maghreb  which in essence was' resumed with the meeting in February between King Hassan of Morocco and President Bendjedid of Algeria. If this movement progresses in a climate of sincerity and fraternity  there will be highly favourable prospects for strengthening peace and development in northern Africa. For our part  I can state firmly that we shall spare no effort to strengthen co-operation not merely with our nearest neighbours in the Maghreb  Morocco and Algeria  but also with the other countries of the region.238.	In our desire to see a prosperous and stable greater Maghreb  Spain is very mindful of the people of the Western Sahara whose future will be fully attained in this broader and united political and economic context to which the countries of the area are aspiring.239.	As is well known  Spain informed the United Nations on 26 February 1976 that it was ending its presence in the territory of the Sahara as administering authority  but  under relevant resolutions  the process of decolonization is not yet over. This cannot be completed until the Saharan people expresses its wishes as to its political future  through the exercise of its right to self-determination  which has been acknowledged repeatedly both by the United Nations and by the OAU  most recently in the resolution adopted at the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity last JuneThe Spanish Government trusts that this people will be able to exercise that right to self-determination through a referendum within the period and under the terms laid down by the OAU.224. As to our European neighbours  we welcome the closer contacts with Portugal  and France  which portend a new climate in our relations. It is a path we shall be pursuing  convinced of the multiple benefits to be obtained by all of us from closer relations.245. Though proximity led me to refer first of all to the Maghreb  Portugal and France  historical and emotional reasons prompt me to refer immediately to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  a country with which we wish to maintain the special relations which derive not from any neo-colonialist paternalism  which we reject  but rather from historic links and the use of a common language which the people of Equatorial Guinea honour and respect. I must not conceal the fact that our relations with the Malabo have been difficult at times over recent months. However  these difficulties in no way rule out Spain's continuing desire to support and cooperate with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea in its programme for political democratization and economic reconstruction  always provided that the existing agreements are honoured.246.	In setting forth the highest priorities of our foreign policy I am bound to refer to our firm intention of recovering Gibraltar. We are linked with Great Britain by good relationships in almost all fields  but these relationships are absurdly affected by the persistence of a colonial situation on our soil. On behalf of my Government  I wish once again to state our determined and unshakeable resolve to restore the territorial integrity of Spain. At the same time the Spanish Government is determined to settle the problem by peaceful means and through dialogue  in the form of negotiations with the United Kingdom on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and with full respect for the legitimate interests of the population of Gibraltar.247.	As evidence of this constructive spirit  and for humanitarian reasons  the Spanish Government took the unilateral decision to open the pedestrian crossing point between La Linea and the City of Gibraltar in December 1982.248.	We trust this process can lead to better understanding between communities which are so closely bound by family and social ties  and to an understanding between Spain and the United Kingdom which will enable us to find the best formula for full implementation of the 1980 Lisbon Declaration.249.	As part of this policy which  although with a European and Western basis  I have defined as the search for a greater degree of autonomy  my Government wishes to strengthen other natural aspects of Spain's foreign policy relating to Latin America and the Mediterranean.250.	There is no need to emphasize here the special relationship which Spain enjoys with Latin American countries. These are not the prerogative of any given Government  but part of a continuous historical State policy.251.	But I would like to repeat explicitly the determination of the new Spanish Government to support to its utmost the various processes of change and self-affirmation now occurring in Latin America  which is increasingly raising its voice  aware of the responsibility for the future which rests with its peoples. That is a voice which Spain feels is its own  and a future in which we wish to be participants.252.	Accordingly  Spain has been following with deep concern the conflict convulsing the countries of Central America. This conflict is deeply rooted in local and domestic events but now has regional consequences which include serious border tensions and covert acts of aggression which are being internationalized; these dangerous elements are being introduced into the process of East- West confrontation.253.	The origin of the conflict  it cannot be emphasized enough  lies in obsolete political  economic and social structures which have led to an unbalanced and unjust distribution of wealth and to a failure to satisfy the expectations of the poorest sectors of the population.254.	In order to attain peace  which is so sought by the peoples of Central America  we feel there are certain essential preconditions: the establishment of genuine pluralistic democracies  the fruit of the popular will; scrupulous respect for human rights; an end to persecution of people because of their ideas; free exercise of political activity; the urgent need to guarantee sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and the inviolability of their frontiers; rejection of the threat or use of force in international relations; the elimination of any form of outside interference; the control of the level of armaments; and the gradual suppression of foreign military bases and advisers.255.	The increase in tension in Central America demands a formula which  based on negotiations between the countries concerned and in co-operation with friendly nations in the area  can prevent the situation from deteriorating into an open international conflict. That offered by the countries of the Contadora Group is the most informed and serious proposal in the sequence of peace initiatives presented so far. It has opened the door to hope. It has lessened tension and it offers the best way of attaining a peaceful solution. The commendable joint effort of the Presidents of Colombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuela  which has generated evident international support  deserves public recognition as well as the consideration already given it.256.	The Spanish Government  which has been following with natural concern the development of the crisis in Central America  expressed its full support for the steps taken by the Contadora Group in a Declaration of the Council of Ministers on 20 April this year. Similarly  it gave immediate support to the Cancun Declaration of 17 July 1983  the general guidelines of which are in keeping with our approach to the matter. Indeed  it responded to the appeal in the Declaration ""to all members of the international community  especially those which have expressed sympathy with the efforts of the Contadora Group ... to contribute  with their experience and diplomatic capability  to the search for peaceful solutions to the problems of Central America"".257.	This effort to bring about peace in -Central America is part of a more general struggle by the peoples of Latin America  who are seeking to achieve  recover or consolidate a political life based on institutions and values guaranteeing the effective exercise of human rights under the rule of law. In this connection  Spain follows with particular interest the significant progress made in recent months towards the restoration of democracy in various countries of South America  and particularly in Argentina. The aspiration of the people of Argentina to a democratic life that will heal the wounds caused by the accumulated suffering of the past is shared by us and  undoubtedly  by the other countries in the southern part of the continent  whose peoples are demanding peacefully but with increasing firmness the exercise of their own sovereignty.258.	In the south Atlantic  in the Malvinas  a source of tension continues to fester  impeding relations of all kinds  not merely between the countries directly involved but also between Western Europe and Latin America.259.	Spain  which has always opposed and continues to oppose the use of force as a means of resolving international disputes  believes that it is urgently necessary for the Governments of Britain and Argentina to set in motion the final solution of this problem through the decolonization of the territory  while guaranteeing the interests of the inhabitants  in keeping with the resolutions of the United Nations.260.	In this connection  the development of the political situation in Argentina should facilitate the diplomatic negotiations which should culminate in the restoration of Argentinian territorial integrity.261.	The Mediterranean constitutes another traditional and special dimension of Spain's foreign policy.262.	My Government trusts that the coastal States of the Mediterranean will be able to create a stable framework which will ensure that any possible conflicts in the area will not lead to intervention by outside Powers tempted to resolve problems in the light of their global interests at the expense of the interests of the countries directly involved. We shall spare no effort to attain this goal and we shall not be discouraged by any difficulties which may arise.263.	In the meantime  we note with grave concern the dramatic situation in the eastern Mediterranean  the Near East.264.	The invasion of Lebanon by the Israeli army contributed to plunging the area once again into a bloody civil war. This was encouraged by outside Powers and factors. We trust that the cease-fire agreement secured recently will prove a first step towards peace and national reconciliation in Lebanon.265.	In 1982 Spain  from its seat in the Security Council  co-operated actively in the efforts to alleviate as far as possible the tragic situation of the Lebanese people. Today in the Assembly we reaffirm that the sovereignty  independence and unity of Lebanon must be preserved at all costs  as must its character as a multiracial and multireligious society. The pluralism of Lebanon once provided a model of peaceful coexistence which must be restored so that its example may benefit the whole region.266.	One of the primary factors in the development of the Lebanese crisis since 1975 has undoubtedly been the Palestinian problem  which  furthermore  also constitutes the core of the endless  painful conflict  in the Near East.267.	Spain's position in this connection has been reiterated on many occasions and is well known: a solution to the problem must be based on withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories  respect for the legitimate rights of all peoples  including Palestine  and the security of all States in the region  including Israel.268.	Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) were milestones in the search for a solution to the conflict in the Near East. But they are not sufficient to bring about comprehensive and lasting peace unless an effort is made to deal with the substance of the question  which is not being done because of the need to take short-term steps. The Security Council should  therefore  supplement its resolutions by a statement clearly and unequivocally reaffirming the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to self-determination.269.	In this effort to attain comprehensive peace in the Near East positive steps have been taken which deserve serious attention. I am referring to the plan adopted at the Arab Summit Conference at Fez last September ' which presupposes a new Arab and Palestinian attitude which could offer possibilities of a dialogue on the attainment of such a peace.270.	Spain took an active part in the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  which met at Geneva only a few weeks ago. My country attended the Conference in a constructive spirit  believing that we should not reject # any non-violent path which might lead to peace  especially if such a path were being sponsored by the United Nations.271.	The moderate character of the Declaration and the Programme of Action adopted by the Conference'"" demonstrated  we believe  how well-founded that approach was.272.	The prolongation of the bloody conflict between Iran and Iraq  with both of which countries we enjoy excellent relations  similarly fills us with deep concern. We call on their leaders to do their utmost to reach a compromise which will enable them to live in peace and good-neighbourliness  with respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.273.	Anxious to see the Mediterranean become a true sea of peace  Spain calls for a speedy  just solution to the problem of Cyprus through a compromise which on the one hand would respect the sovereignty  dependence and territorial integrity of the island and on the other ensure the peaceful coexistence and balanced economic development of both communities. We reiterate our support for the intercommunal talks under the auspices of the United Nations and for the efforts of the Secretary-General.274.	As the Secretary-General made clear in his recent admirable report on the work of the Organization  ""There have been  at any given time in past years  several regional situations with grave potential implications for international peace"".275.	We share the Secretary-General's concern  all the more so because these conflicts are worsening and beings compounded by the East-West tension. I have referred to some of these at some length  but I should like briefly to refer to some others.276.	The lengthy struggle which has been convulsing the Republic of Chad for some 20 years now has become worse over recent months. The Spanish Government supports the efforts of the OAU to find a peaceful  stable and lasting solution which would enable the people of Chad to undertake national reconstruction and the economic development of the country in conditions of freedom  independence and full sovereignty.277.	In connection with the problem of Namibia  Spain has repeatedly and unequivocally called for the speedy independence of the Territory. The illegal presence of South Africa in Namibia  as well as the delaying tactics of Pretoria  have been condemned by our country on many occasions and in many international gatherings. We believe that the only just solution lies through implementation of the plan contained in Security Council resolutions 385 (1976)  435 (1978) and 532 (1983)  which my country fully supports.278.	We also support the efforts by the Secretary- General  one of the most recent manifestations of which was his journey to South Africa  Namibia and Angola in order to try to find a solution to the grave problems besetting southern Africa.279.	We similarly repeat our determined support for the United Nations resolutions on the situation in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea. Spain joins with those who call for withdrawal of foreign troops from those two countries so that their peoples can have a genuine possibility of choosing their own future in peace and freedom without any form of pressure or outside interference.280.	Although  as the Secretary-General says in his valuable report on the work of the Organization  ""1983 has  so far  been a frustrating year for the search for peace  stability and justice""  nevertheless we share his belief that  for all its defects  the United Nations is ""the best available international instrumentality to achieve these ends"". 281.	This will be the spirit in which the Spanish delegation will be acting during this session of the General Assembly. "
"47",2273,"ETH",38,1983,"ï»¿49.	 At the very outset I congratulate Mr. Jorge Illueca on his well deserved election as president of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly and wish him every success in the discharge of the onerous responsibilities entrusted to him. I also express our sincere appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the effective manner in which he guided the work of the thirty-seventh session.50.	Our special appreciation also goes to the Secretary- General  who through his indefatigable efforts is endeavouring to enhance the effectiveness and increase the prestige of the United Nations.51.	Last but not least  on behalf of the Ethiopian delegation I extend a warm welcome to the newly independent State of Saint Christopher and Nevis as it enters this family of sovereign nations.52.	It has become a tradition for the Organization of African Unity through its current Chairman  to address the General Assembly on the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of Africa. Accordingly  I have been instructed by my head of State  Mr. Mengistu Haile- Mariam  the current Chairman of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  f deliver the following message to the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly.53.	Peace and progress are the pressing needs and the immutable objectives of all the peoples of the world. But that these objectives could not be fully and globally achieved remains the foremost preoccupation of the world today. We in Africa are convinced that  as the sole universal forum for international deliberation and action  the United Nations has a unique and leading role to play in the attainment of the lofty objectives of peace and progress for the whole of mankind.54.	Throughout history  societies have continuously struggled for common identity  independence and peaceful development  as well as for equal and mutually beneficial relationships with one another. Whereas the universal validity of these goals is evident  the struggle to attain them was often frustrated by the forces of oppression and domination  thus causing humanity to alternate between hope and despair  and between war and peace.55.	So long as these basic and universal yearnings of mankind are not respected  it is inevitable that peace and progress will remain mere hopes and aspirations. It is in this perspective that we in Africa view the diverse problems confronting us today.56.	Ours is a demand that the universal character and validity of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations be recognized and scrupulously respected  so that the United Nations might be strengthened and world peace and security guaranteed. Ours is a demand that the identity and sovereignty of each nation be respected  in order to enrich existing civilizations and lay the foundations for a universal one. Ours is a demand that the peaceful and collective development of peoples be guaranteed  to ensure the eradication from the face of the earth of the age-old enemies of mankind and to build a more congenial environment for the full realization of human potentialities. Ours is a demand that international relations be restructured on the basis of equality and mutual respect  in order to remove tension and confrontation and replace them with detente  co-operation and mutual concern.57.	Despite the fact that Africa is the cradle of rich civilizations  at one point in time it was designated by colonial Powers as the  dark continent   which paved the way for the merciless plunder of its natural resources  for the trampling underfoot of the rights and freedom of its peoples  for the defiling of its cultures and for the sale of its sons and daughters like chattels. But the rich legacies of Africa's identity and freedom  as well as its resilient civilizations could never be wiped out. As a result  and after a long and arduous struggle by the peoples of Africa for cultural and national identity  the preponderant majority of African countries have today attained their independence and sovereignty.58.	However  due to the exploitative and oppressive colonial experience and the prevailing iniquitous international economic order which has its origin in the era of colonialism  Africa is currently facing numerous and varied problems.59.	As is well known  throughout the long periods of cultural domination  economic activities in the parcelled African region were deliberately centered on the merciless exploitation of Africa's natural resources  which itself was a further sequel to the prior inhumane exploitation of Africa through the slave trade of the preceding centuries. Further  the subjugated African colonies were forced into an unhealthy integration of their social and economic life with that of the metropolitan countries. The African economy  as a result  is today characterized by the deep scars of colonialism and the inhuman ravages of imperialism. Indeed  the direction and content of our social and economic development were disoriented  while the momentum for growth and for an eventual take-off was retarded.60.	With this background  added to which are the constant manoeuvres of imperialism  the African economy finds itself today with all the basic structural symptoms and crises of underdevelopment: over-specialization in the production of a few export commodities  over dependency on other growth centers of the world  chronic balance-of-payments deficits  increasing food shortages  institutional inadequacies and so forth. Indeed  such problems have become so common and serious in Africa that 26 African countries  representing more than half of all the African States  are classified among the 36 least developed countries of the world.61.	Furthermore  the present economic crisis in the world has affected all sectors of African economic activity  both national and international. The collapse of the prices of our principal exports of agricultural and mineral raw materials in spite of the efforts of UNCTAD to implement the Integrated Programme for Commodities has drastically reduced our foreign exchange earnings from these exports  which constitute the most important element of the developing countries' import and debt- servicing capacity. Coupled with the severe liquidity squeeze  these developments have forced our countries to cut down on their national programmes of social and economic development  in full awareness of the social and political consequences of doing so.62.	The average growth rate of the gross domestic product has plummeted from 4.4. per cent in 1980 to 2 per cent in 1981 and 1.1. per cent in 1982  which is considerably lower than the average population growth rate  implying that for the whole continent real per capita income has been on a continuous decline over the years and is below the level of the early 1960s. Indeed  some countries are experiencing a negative growth rate.63.	The rising import bills for food  energy and other essentials  together with the high rate of imported inflation and dwindling export earnings  has contributed to the high level of current account deficits of $14 billion  and to a total external debt of $75 billion  compared with only $14.2 billion in 1973. It is now widely recognized that with the average debt-service ratio of 20 per cent projected for this year  many African countries will continue to encounter severe difficulties in servicing external debt  in financing current account deficits and  hence  in financing the projected flow of imports. 64.	In addition  many of our countries are affected by devastating natural disasters  such as severe drought  desertification and floods  with serious repercussions on Africa's ability to feed its teeming population. The response of the international community to the plight of developing countries has been negative  or at best ambivalent  as typified by the recently concluded sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade. The developed and industrialized countries  in spite of the recognized interdependence of the world economy  adopted the usual negative approach  so much so that even the very few resolutions that were adopted at Belgrade were subject to frustrating reservations.65.	The developing countries themselves have taken various initiatives and made concrete proposals to advance international economic co-operation. Our efforts at the level of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Group of 77 bear testimony to this claim. Had these initiatives been acted upon and had the call for a new international economic order been fully supported by all  we would have laid a solid foundation for a better world.66.	Africa has persistently advocated the restructuring of the present inequitable international economic order as well as its own domestic economic system. Africa continues to press for the establishment of a new international economic order and the immediate launching of global negotiations. It was in this spirit that Africa took the historic step of working out a regional development strategy adopted at Lagos in April 1980 by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its second extraordinary session. This strategy  now commonly known as the Lagos Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos  lays down the philosophy and strategy for change in Africa. Africa is indeed firmly convinced that there is no viable alternative to the implementation of the basic principles of the Lagos Plan of Action  namely  collective self-reliance and self-sustainment so that an African economic community may be realized by the year 2000.67.	At this point  let me hasten to emphasize that Africa's adoption of a strategy of self-reliance and self-sustainment does not in any way imply the renunciation of international support. On the contrary  it anticipates full support from the international community  as was recently restated in the Addis Ababa Declaration on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee anniversary celebration of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa  which inter alia  called upon the international community through the General Assembly of the United Nations to support [the] endeavour by providing the necessary moral  technical and financial support to the efforts of African countries in their faithful implementation of the goals and objectives of the Lagos Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos in accordance with the provisions of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. I sincerely hope that this humble call will be heard and that there will be a response to it.68.	Africa's effort and determination will require a considerable amount of external support of all kinds  and it is with this in mind that we urge the General Assembly and other United Nations organs to play the principal role in global economic negotiations  in order that all issues be addressed in an interrelated manner  in full recognition of their interdependence as well as the interdependence of all economies of the world  and also in order to ensure a comprehensive solution and results that are beneficial to developing countries. The General Assembly and all other United Nations organs must give full attention to all issues in the domain of North-South economic cooperation  with priority consideration to the liquidity problems facing developing countries  the chronic balance- of-payments problems  the collapse of commodity prices and the acute food situation facing developing countries  as well as the special problem of the least developed countries  among others.69.	In all these areas  the concrete proposals of developing countries are on the table. These include  in particular  the convening of an international conference on money and finance for development to address seriously the issues of transfer of resources to developing countries  the reform of the international monetary system and an effective framework for co-operation in the areas of money and finance for development.70.	Further  the problem of trade in raw materials should be accorded high priority with a view to securing improvement in prices  ensuring easy access to markets and allowing developing countries to maximize their benefits from all activities relating to marketing  transportation and distribution of their raw materials.71.	Unless this is done  what is being described currently as recovery in some countries will be meaningless to us in the third world  because the so-called trickle-down effect has never worked in the past and is most unlikely to work now  given the pervasive nature and the depth of the current economic crisis and the structural rigidity of the majority of our countries.72.	Negative attitudes must give way to reason and to a common resolve to save humanity from destitution  despair and an uncertain future.73.	Coupled with these severe economic problems  the challenge of the complete eradication of colonialism and racism from the face of the continent still faces Africa.74.	In their long struggle for independence  equality and justice  the peoples of Africa have always opted  wherever possible  for the peaceful attainment of their objectives. In this respect  the Lusaka Manifesto stands as a living testimony. But Africa has been compelled to resort to armed struggle because the response of the colonialists and racists to Africa's legitimate quest for freedom has been only mindless violence.75.	Faced with this situation  the United Nations also recognizes the right of all peoples to resort to armed struggle against racists and colonialists.76.	The just struggle of peoples  which has vanquished the forces of racism and colonialism and ensured the accession to independence of countries such as Angola  Mozambique  Zimbabwe and others in our continent  is at once a cause for pride to the peace-loving international community and a significant contribution to the further strengthening of the principles of the United Nations. Nevertheless  a serious challenge awaits us  since the odious system which continues to defy flagrantly the will of the international community and reject with utter impunity the principles of the Charter of the United Nations is still entrenched in Namibia and South Africa.77.	Today  Namibia is still languishing under the illegal and colonial occupation of South Africa  despite the many decisions of the Security Council and the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly as well as the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice The United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  approved in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  is yet to be implemented  owing to the deception and intransigence of the South African regime. We are fully aware that the responsibility for the delay in implementation must be shared by the members of the so-called Western contact group  which are at once the initiators of the plan and the sole obstacle to the adoption of enforcement measures for its implementation.78.	Indeed  Africa cannot but express its extreme indignation at the attempts being made to hold Namibia's independence hostage to the realization of the strategic objectives of some of the members of the contact group. In this regard  we reaffirm our common position that the presence of Cuban forces in Angola is totally unrelated to the question of Namibia's independence. We reject any linkage or parallelism.79.	Inasmuch as the racist regime has so far refused to comply with the numerous resolutions of the United Nations  one wonders for how long the Organization can continue adopting resolutions which will invariably remain unimplemented. This  we believe  is a question of crucial importance. We are convinced  in this regard  that the United Nations has no alternative but to prove once again its commitment to human freedom  dignity and equality by shouldering its historic responsibility to the Namibian people and adopting a programme of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa.80.	Even though the people of Namibia will gain their freedom and independence through their own struggle and under their sole and legitimate  representative  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  Africa believes that economic sanctions will help pressure the South African regime to opt for the peaceful and speedy renunciation of its illegal occupation of the international Territory of Namibia.81.	In the mean time  however  Africa is resolved to render all possible political  diplomatic and material assistance to SWAPO and the struggling people of Namibia. In this connection  I deem it my duty to call upon the international community to do likewise  inasmuch as the armed struggle being waged by the people of Namibia is part and parcel of the world-wide struggle for freedom and dignity  deserving the total support of all peoples that love freedom and justice.82.	Another just struggle that equally deserves our total support is that of the oppressed masses of South Africa  whose political freedom and human dignity have been trampled upon by the racist regime in Pretoria far too long. The inhuman and repugnant system of apartheid is not only a challenge to the international community  but an insult to the conscience of mankind as well. We therefore call upon the United Nations in particular and the international community in general to help put an end to this crime against humanity by isolating the racist regime in every sphere of international life and by extending at the same time to the liberation movements of South Africa all the necessary moral and material assistance. Moreover  we call upon those Western countries whose transnational corporations are engaged in the plunder of the natural resources of both South Africa and Namibia and whose Governments identify their interests with those of the racist regime  to practice in South Africa what they globally preach about human rights and fundamental freedoms.83.	Not content with this brutal oppression of the peoples of South Africa and Namibia  the racist Pretoria regime has now embarked on a grand strategy of destabilization and naked aggression against the front-line African countries. Subversive and terrorist groups  organized  armed and financed by the racist regime  are currently operating in Angola  Mozambique  Lesotho and Zimbabwe  depriving the peoples of those countries of peace and stability and thereby forcing them to divert their attention and resources from the urgent task of economic and social reconstruction.84.	Apart from committing repeated acts of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola  the apartheid regime is now in illegal occupation of parts of southern Angola. Furthermore  it is attempting to strangulate the land-locked Kingdom of Lesotho.85.	It is Africa's view that these acts of aggression and destabilization are designed not only to cripple the armed struggle of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa  but also to overthrow the Governments of the front-line States because of their steadfast and selfless support of the struggle of the oppressed peoples of southern Africa. I submit that this evil design should not be glossed over with more condemnatory and ineffective resolutions. Instead  the international community must assist the front-line States in every way possible in order to enable them to defend better their sovereignty and territorial integrity.86.	In addition to the problems in southern Africa  Africa is also preoccupied with other predicaments  one of which is the situation in Chad. This problem  which is almost 20 years old  has caused immense loss of life and destruction of property in that troubled land. It will be recalled that this question was one of the most pressing issues before the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth session. While the objective of our organization is to find a lasting and peaceful solution to this problem  its complexity and the volatile nature of the situation  as well as the divergent views of internal and external forces  have made it difficult to arrive at a lasting solution more expeditiously.87.	Everybody  of course  believes in the need for peace; the difference arises on how to achieve it. For our part  we are trying to listen to all sides and to find a just solution to the problem. In this connection  we have called upon the external forces to refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Chad so as not to exacerbate the situation. We convened the bureau of the nineteenth session of the Assembly and conducted a useful exchange of views with African leaders  thus benefiting from their advice and suggestions as to the possible future course of action. We are still doing everything possible to find a formula acceptable to all and to this end we are in constant touch with the parties directly concerned and with other African leaders. We remain confident that the United Nations and the international community will give the support necessary for the success of our efforts.88.	The other problem to which our organization is seeking a solution is the question of Western Sahara. Apart from the adverse consequences it has had on the parties concerned  this problem  as we all know  challenged and threatened the very existence of our organization. However  African leaders  inspired by their devotion to the ideals and purposes of the organization and guided by the ideals and spirit of African brotherhood  have  through serious discussions and consultations  succeeded in preserving and strengthening their indispensable continental organization.89.	Subsequent to my consultations with the parties directly involved  as well as with other African leaders  with a view to creating an atmosphere conducive to the implementation of resolution the question of Western Sahara  adopted by the Assembly at its nineteenth session. I convened a meeting of the Implementation Committee at Addis Ababa from 21 to 23 September 1983. It is to be regretted  however  that the Committee had to adjourn indefinitely as a result of a procedural objection raised by Morocco. 90.	This temporary setback notwithstanding  we shall continue to search for a lasting solution to the problem of Western Sahara on the basis of that resolution. We shall not despair. Nonetheless  it must be made clear at this juncture that the quest for a solution requires the goodwill of both parties  for the co-operation of one party alone would not produce the desired results. In this regard  we are appreciative of the assistance and support given to the OAU by the United Nations and are also looking forward to greater co-operation between the two organizations in the final disposal of the problem.91.	The OAU also seeks and hopes to receive the support and co-operation of the United Nations in the final settlement of the problems arising out of the claims of the sister African States of the Comoros over Mayotte  of Madagascar over the four Malagasy islands  as well as of Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago.92.	Another problem in which the OAU is involved in fruitful co-operation with the United Nations is that of refugeesâa problem which is closely linked with the economic  social and political development of Africa and whose solution has to be sought in this context. Although the problem is complicated and many-faceted  Africa has a clear perception of its continental scope and  as a result  is collectively endeavouring to find solutions to it. We realize that actions taken by each individual country are decisive for the final outcome of this common effort.93.	The OAU is taking various steps to co-ordinate this collective endeavour. In particular  it is engaged in coordinating the activities of donor agencies and in developing a strategy that would enable it to evaluate and fully appraise the problem of refugees. In this respect  I am happy to note that it has been decided to hold  in the very near future  the second international conference on assistance to refugees in Africa. I also wish to commend all Governments and organizations which have so far provided assistance to African refugees and  at the same time  would like to express the hope that these Governments and agencies would continue to assist us in dealing with this serious human problem.94.	Apart from those I have already mentioned  there are numerous situations and problems which are a source of serious concern to Africa. High among these is the ever-escalating and threatening arms race. In the past  mankind had sought its security through the acquisition of armaments. But with the advent of nuclear weapons  the vast majority of the people of the world has realized that it is only through disarmament that the security and well-being of humanity can be enhanced.95.	This realization notwithstanding  new weapons  both nuclear and chemical  with greater accuracy and massive destructive power  are  being produced and deployed. Furthermore  the rapid development of science and technology has created the awesome possibility of the militarization of outer space. As has already been repeatedly stated from this and other forums  the arms race is consuming human and material resources which could otherwise have been used to advance the material well-being of humanity at large.96.	Africa believes that security can be achieved only through the peaceful resolution of international problems and the realization of the goal of general and complete disarmament. As a consequence  Africa cannot subscribe to the dangerous policy of nuclear deterrence and  indeed  expresses its utter indignation at the squandering on the arms race of much of the world's resources  when millions are still languishing under the yoke of poverty  disease and Ignorance. We  therefore  call for a halt to the arms race so that this dangerous process can be reversed and the security of nations sought at lower levels of armament. Africa also extends its solidarity to all those forces struggling for peace and disarmament in all parts of the world.97.	In this connection  I have to mention Africa's support for the establishment of zones of peace and nuclear- weapon-free zones in the different regions of the world. In reaffirming our decision in favour of the denuclearization of Africa  I have to warn the international community of the dangers posed to international peace and security by the nuclear programme of the racist regime of South Africa  which is assisted by certain western States in this perilous venture.98.	In the same vein  I have to state that the further militarization of the Indian Ocean  in contravention of the decisions and declarations by the OAU  the Non- Aligned Movement and  above all  the United Nations  is threatening not only the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the littoral and hinterland States of the Ocean  but also the peace and security of the world at large. The expansion of existing military bases and the search for new ones do not augur well for the security of the region. We  therefore  call for the early convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean and the speedy implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.99.	Africa's concern for the strengthening of international peace and security  as well as the progress of mankind  forces it to take concrete positions on various regional problems facing the international community. One such problem on which the OAU has taken an unequivocal stance is the question of Palestine and the Middle East. In order for the States and peoples of that region to achieve a just and lasting peace  it is Africa's conviction that the suffering Palestinian people must attain its legitimate and inalienable rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent state in its territory. Furthermore  the PLO  as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  must participate on an equal footing in all negotiations affecting the fate of the people of Palestine. Israel must also withdraw from all Arab and Palestinian territories occupied by it since 1967. The right of every State in the region to live in peace within internationally recognized boundaries must also be respected by all.100.	Furthermore  Africa believes that Lebanon must be left alone to regain its social peace and political stability through scrupulous respect for its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as its national unity.101.	The other problem of concern to Africa is the war that has been raging for the last three years between Iran and Iraq. Over and above the great loss of life  the immense destruction of property and the displacement of persons that it has entailed  the war between the two countries has become a source of instability and insecurity for the Gulf region. On behalf of Africa  I would like once again to call on both Governments  mindful of their responsibilities and in response to the appeals previously made by the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement and the OAU  to cease hostilities and to try to resolve the problem peacefully.102.	As regards the tension and conflict that prevail in Central America  the South Atlantic  Cyprus  the various sub-regions of Asia  including South-East Asia  and the Korean peninsula  I wish to express the hope that peaceful solutions will be found to all these problems and that all those concerned will make a determined effort towards that end.103.	I would be remiss in my duty if  at this juncture  I were not to say a few words in the name of the people and Government of socialist Ethiopia regarding the Ethiopian revolution.104.	Throughout its long history Ethiopia has successfully preserved its independence and territorial integrity against repeated attempts by foreign Powers. However  the archaic feudal system and the capitalist production relations which were  at a later stage  grafted on this system  had kept the country in a backward state  depriving it of any meaningful social and economic development. During those years of bitter existence  a handful of feudal lords  having appropriated to themselves almost all the resources of the country  had subjected the broad masses of Ethiopia to cruel and barbaric exploitation  forcing them to live in utter misery and wretchedness  denied of their human dignity and fundamental freedoms. It is to this inhuman system that the social revolution of the Ethiopian people has dealt a mortal blow  and it is today striving to build in its stead an order based on freedom  equality and social justice.105.	This social revolution  and the subsequent fundamental changes it has brought about  is part and parcel of the global demand for peace and progress  and as such it is not directed against any country. If anything  it should have been taken as a contribution to the building of an international system based on peace  justice and equality. Regrettably  however  it is this revolution that remains a target of external threats and aggression. In this connection  particular reference must be made to the provocative military exercises repeatedly conducted in our region by the United States of America  creating a sense of danger and alarm in many countries of the area  including my own. The people and Government of socialist Ethiopia vehemently oppose such provocative acts aimed at undermining the peace and stability of Ethiopia and the region as a whole106.	I have so far attempted to outline briefly the existing problems pertaining to peace and development in Africa as well as Africa's position on the issues of the day. It is quite evident that these problems in large measure emanate from the gap that exists between the objective reality obtaining in the world  on the one hand  and the lofty ideals of the United Nations  on the other.107.	We believe that the Organization  which serves as the rallying point for the peoples of the world  should be a forum where collective struggle can be waged to bridge that gap and bring about better understanding among peoples and countries wherein the human aspect of civilization shall characterize the relations between peoples and nations everywhere. Hence  in order to alter the course of events in the world and reorient them  change is imperative. However  this is not to advocate a change in the purposes and principles of the Organization  which we believe are noble and sound  but to propose a change in attitude and perception as well as a change in orientation and priorities in action. In essence this is but a call for international relations to be guided by the paramount goals of peace and progress for entire mankind and for their conduct to be based on the principles and norms of international law and the precepts of justice.108.	The growing demand for such a change  echoed in the Organization  must be met with a positive response in order to reassure the peoples of the world which have reposed confidence in the United Nations and whose destiny  in large measure  depends on the nature of that response. Certainly  we are all aware that the issue is a complex and difficult one. Nevertheless  it is a challenge that must be met individually and collectively. There is no more gratifying task than that of facing this epochal challenge and meeting the obligations dictated by our time.109.	Africa  for its part  stands for change and for the building of a better world. We cannot stand by as helpless observers. On behalf of Africa  I should like to reassure this august Assembly that we are resolved to make concrete and effective contributions in support of any move of the Organization that would help realize the noble purposes of the United Nations.110.	We know that the Organization has so far made significant and historic contributions in preserving world peace and in advancing the peaceful search for new and just economic  political and social as well as information orders. In this regard  Africa is indebted to the Organization. Indeed  it is a well-known fact that Africa's long and arduous struggle for independence and development has been fully supported by the United Nations. We are certain that the Organization will continue to render us moral  political and material support in the remaining phases of our struggle. Long live African unity. Long live the United Nations."
"48",2319,"FIN",38,1983,"ï»¿1. May I begin  Sir  by extending my warm congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Your country and mine have always enjoyed friendly relations. I am convinced that you will lead this session to a successful conclusion.2.	Permit me also to express the best wishes of Finland to the newly independent State of Saint Christopher and Nevis  the 158th Member of the United Nations.3.	We in Finland recall vividly the recent visit of the Secretary-General to our country. He made a deep impression by his wisdom and experience when analyzing the problems the United Nations is facing. I hope that we convinced him of the dedication of the people and Government of Finland to carrying out their responsibilities towards the Organization.4.	As my predecessor did in 1970  1 have come to the Assembly in order to reaffirm Finland's active commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter  and to the United Nations as the principal instrument available to nations for keeping the peace in the world.5.	Finland's security is based on co-operation and friendly relations with its neighbouring countries and with all States of the world. We are ready and fully committed to work in co-operation with other Member States for collective security under the Charter and for joint action to preserve and to restore peace.6.	Many of the most serious threats to international security today seem  unfortunately  to be beyond the reach of the United Nations. The use of force in international relations has remained a regrettably common phenomenon. This is one of the principal challenges to the authority of the United Nations.7.	The United Nations must be strengthened.8.	A strong United Nations is in the interest of every Member State  big and small alike. Yet all too often this is forgotten by the parties to various disputes on the basis of short-sighted calculations and political expediency  with tragic consequences for all.9.	The world can ill afford such a development. To counteract it  we must look realistically at the capabilities of the principal United Nations organs.10.	The Security Council bears the primary responsibility for international peace and security. Implementation of and respect for Security Council resolutions by Member States are the corner-stone of the Charter and the foundation on which the viability of the United Nations as a whole rests. This applies to all Member States  yet the heaviest responsibility falls on the permanent members of the Council. Their failure to agree in the case of a specific dispute in no way absolves them or the Council from the duties entrusted to them by the Charter.11.	The international community  and in particular small States like Finland  will always look to the Security Council to take swift and decisive action to impose its will  to stop aggression and to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes. This has often proved impossible. States have learned not to turn to the United Nations in their security need. There is another lesson to be learned: that the task of the United Nations is not only to stop wars  but to prevent them.12.	The United Nations could be the most effective instrument for preventive action. Member States should make full use of the services the Organization can provide for making peace and keeping the peace. This is the way to a rational world order based on the Charter of the United Nations.13.	The Charter remains as valid as ever  but the working methods and procedures of the principal organs of the United Nations may need adaptation on the basis of experience. Above all this concerns the functioning of the Security Council. We hope the Council will be able to develop procedures for initiating action in the early stages of conflicts in order to prevent the use of force.14.	Preventive diplomacy and the prevention of the use of force are challenges both to the Security Council and to the whole international community. All countries live in the shadow of nuclear weapons  and nothing can be more important than the prevention of nuclear war. Tension between nuclear-weapon States is therefore a source of concern to all.15.	We have been witnessing mounting tension and distrust in recent times. Harsh language has been their measure; increased fear may be their consequence. In this Hall  intended to provide a forum for dialogue in which all States ought to be able to participate without impediment and where courtesy and respect are every Member State's due  I wish to make an earnest appeal for a cool attitude when tempers are hot. Such an attitude does not exclude generosity and compassion.16.	Yet to an optimistic mind some signs of hope have been discernible. There are indications that the political will to negotiate has not been lost. The 35 States participating in the follow-up meeting at Madrid of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have agreed on a substantive concluding document  which opens new avenues towards improved security. This fact justifies cautious optimism  as do the hopes recently born that the leading nuclear Powers will finally find a way to proceed successfully in their negotiations on both strategic and so-called intermediate-range nuclear forces. Security will increase not with the acquisition or deployment of new and even more destructive nuclear weapons  but rather with limitation and reduction of their number. The world expects that the dialogue between the nuclear- weapon States will help to turn the arms race in the opposite direction.17.	Without new agreements the arms race will continue  producing more fear and tension. It is an undeniable fact that the nuclear-weapon States already possess a manifold over-kill capacity. Nuclear weapons are not weapons in the old sense of the word. They are devices of senseless and uncontrollable destruction  the scope of which eludes our imagination. No rational political aims can be pursued by reliance on the use of these fearsome products of modern technology. They have become a source of infinite insecurity for all nations  including the nuclear-weapon States themselves. Possession of them therefore implies an enormous responsibility.18.	People everywhereâin the West and in the East  in nuclear-weapon States and in non-nuclear-weapon States alikeâare expressing their anxiety about the present course of events. The Governments bearing responsibility for nuclear weapons  and the international community as a whole  should finally be able to display the moral courage and the common sense needed to respond in the only sensible way: by eliminating the nuclear danger.19.	Nuclear war is nowhere professed to be a means of rational policy. To limit such a war would scarcely be possible. Its effects would extend beyond all national boundaries. The authorization of even the smallest nuclear reprisal in a crisis situation would quite probably lead to an all-out nuclear war. Awareness of this fact should lead to further agreements now. The use of force is prohibited by the Charter  but the peoples of the world are entitled to specific assurances against the use of nuclear weapons.20.	Finland has made its contribution by becoming a party to all treaties in the disarmament field open to it. In particular  Finland has consistently supported the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as the best instrument to combat the spread of the possession of nuclear weapons  which is a threat to all States  nuclear and non-nuclear alike. We urge all nations to accede to it and to accept international safeguards on all their nuclear activities. The supply and use of nuclear materials for peaceful purposes and the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons are necessary complements of each other.21.	By acceding to the Treaty  my country has reaffirmed an obligation never to acquire nuclear weapons of its own. Nor do we allow any nuclear weapons on our territory. The non-nuclear status of Finland is thus comprehensive in the full meaning of the word. As a consequence  we are entitled to expect and to demand that such weapons are never  under any circumstances  used against us and that we are not threatened with such weapons. We welcome the assurances given so far in this respect by the nuclear-weapon States. We hope that they will eventually agree on a set of effective security guarantees.22.	Finland has sought to consolidate the prevailing nuclear-weapon-free status in the region of northern Europe through initiatives for the creation of a Nordic nuclear-weapon-free zone.23.	The days when a State could pursue a policy completely independent of all others are long past. It is therefore of great importance that all countries  irrespective of their social systems and their belonging to different military alliances  be ready to increase their co-operation. This by itself will strengthen confidence in a peaceful political development in the world. Peace is the best guarantee for all peoples that they will be able to achieve their own objectives. This requires consideration for the valid interests of others  mutual understanding and tolerance.24.	The United Nations  together with the specialized agencies  is a unique instrument for international cooperation  not only in the field of security. Through the United Nations  Finland and other small States have learned to carry wider responsibilities than ever before. Thus we all take part in the efforts to reduce poverty and implement human rights and fundamental freedoms. In areas such as these  the practical results of the work of the United Nations cannot be easily quantified. They are important components in the contribution that the United Nations and its specialized agencies make to the construction of a safer and more just world.25.	Here I want to pay a tribute to the initiative of the chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries leading to the presence of a number of heads of State or Government at the present session of the General Assembly. This is convincing proof of widespread willingness to give full weight to the efforts of the United Nations to maintain peace and to strengthen its authority.26.	Maintaining relations of trust and co-operation with its neighbours and pursuing an active policy of neutrality designed to promote peaceful development  Finland hopes to play a constructive role as a member of the international community. Our policy of neutrality enables us to maintain friendly relations with all States  irrespective of their social system  size or security policy. Through this consistent policy  we stand ready  whenever possible  to work for conciliation and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.27.	We believe in the United Nations. We need the Organization  and we are convinced that the United Nations needs the full co-operation of all its Member States. "
"49",2364,"FJI",38,1983,"ï»¿114.	 Mr. President  it gives me much pleasure to add my delegation's congratulations to the many you have already received on your election as President. We are confident that  with your well- known diplomatic skills and experience  the work of this session will be successfully concluded.115.	I should also like to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  who presided over the thirty-seventh session with distinction.116.	The efforts of the Secretary General to make the United Nations a more effective instrument of peace are to be commended. His report on the work of the Organization	merits serious consideration by us all.117.	This session of the General Assembly is convening against the backdrop of severe crises in international relations. The conflict in the Middle East  the continued armed interventions in the Asian region  the crisis in Central America and conflicts in various parts of Africa pose grave threats to international peace. The heightening of tensions between East and West  the stagnation of the North-South dialogue and the disarmament process and the prevalence of human rights violations and acts of terror provide further causes for alarm and insecurity. A11 these issues urgently need solutions  and my delegation hopes that at this session sincere and renewed efforts with be made to strengthen international co-operation and the Organization's various organs so that it can respond effectively to settle disputes and defuse the various crises which threaten world peace and security.118.	My country is far removed from the centers of conflict and is in a region that has thankfully enjoyed peace. However  despite the distance and the peace that we enjoy  we are not insensitive to the plight and sufferings of the victims of conflicts elsewhere in the world. Nor are we unmindful of our international responsibility for positive and tangible action in the quest for peace. Indeed  it was Fiji's commitment to peace that led us to our direct involvement in the United Nations efforts to bring peace and stability in Lebanon. It is regrettable that this past year has witnessed no progress at all towards a durable solution in Lebanon.119.	But the question of Lebanon is part of the overall problem of the Middle East. My Government acknowledges the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every State in this war-torn region  including Israel. At the same time  we support the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and a homeland. To this end  my Government believes that the essential elements for a peaceful solution are already embraced in the various United Nations resolutions and peace plans. These elements provide sufficient basis for dialogue and can pave the way for a negotiated and durable solution which has defied us for decades. But for that to succeed  courage  imagination  understanding and flexibility are required for all sides.120.	Regrettably  peace has been absent for many years from parts of Asia. We fully share the international concern over foreign interventions in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. Such interventions continue to violate the sovereignty of their victims. In both cases  the international community has taken an unequivocal stand and laid the basis for a peaceful political solution of these problems. Only through the unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces and the elimination of all forms of outside intervention can peace by attained.121.	The unresolved Korean question still constitutes a potentially dangerous situation in the region. We believe that peaceful reunification of Korea should be pursued by means of dialogue and negotiation between North and South Korea  without interference from any outside Power.122.	May I  at this juncture  express my delegation's strong condemnation of the brutal act of terrorism that resulted in the tragic death of several eminent South Korean leaders over the weekend. I extend my Government's deep sympathy to the people and Government of Korea on this tragic loss.123.	Fiji shares the concern expressed from this rostrum at the world economic situation. Whilst it is true that there have been signs of recovery in some of the developed countries  the desperate situation in many developing countries finds no immediate hope of relief. It is clear that more needs to be done to ensure that the recovery will be vigorous and durable. More is yet required if the benefits of the recovery are to be transmitted to developing countries. But for this to happen requires some major changes in the international monetary system to make it more responsive to the needs of developing countries. To this end  we support the call for a conference of the Bretton Woods type to re-examine the world monetary system.124.	It is to be regretted that past efforts to solve the economic crisis through global negotiations have not made any significant headway. Amid this gloom  there is at least a glimmer of hope. Negotiations involving nearly half of the States Members of the Organization began last Thursday in Luxembourg on a successor to the second Lom6 Convention between the European Economic Community and African  Caribbean and Pacific States. The Convention is a model for economic relationships between developed and developing countries  and my delegation believes that an extension of the spirit of that Convention to the global economic scene can make a positive contribution to the North-South relationship.125.	The world economic crisis has affected the economies of small island States in my part of the region particularly harshly. At the same time  it has brought into sharp focus the very peculiar problems facing small island States that need to be addressed urgently.126.	Island States have many unique developmental problems that appear paradoxical at first sight. The social indicators point to solid  positive achievements: higher life expectancy  higher school enrolment  declining fertility rates and better health services. These positive achievements tend to obscure the natural disadvantages that place a real burden on island States in developing their economies.127.	The disadvantages faced by small islands are many and include an open economy with a strong dependence on imported goods and services  small population  limited land size  a low level of economic opportunity  isolation from the major markets and proneness to natural disasters.128.	In addition to these problems  many island States are fragmented and scattered over vast expanses of ocean. Their fragmentation  combined with smallness and remoteness  effectively hampers development. These factors are a strong disincentive to overseas investment. They limit the involvement of lending agencies  whose operations are not geared to economies the size of the island State in the first place. They increase the problem of transportation and the problem of aggregating exports to achieve economies in marketing. The Government is forced to provide services  often at extremely high cost  in such situations.129.	A factor contributing to the high cost of providing services has external causes in the high interest rates imposed by lending agencies. The insistence on gross domestic product as a factor in lending by international banking institutions means that Fiji and any other countries which are registering modest achievements in their development efforts must pay the same interest rates as the developed industrialized economies. Such a policy is absurd. The application of those rules to countries with narrow-based economies in the predicament I have referred to needs to be re-examined.130.	For island States to participate meaningfully and effectively in North-South or South-South co-operation  it is critical that problems peculiar to them be taken into account appropriately and urgently by the world community.131.	When we reflect upon some of the significant achievements of the United Nations  the success in the field of decolonization springs to mind. The admission of Saint Christopher and Nevis to the United Nations at the opening of this session affirms yet again the solid achievement in that field.132.	I take this opportunity to congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on attaining its independence and to welcome it as a full Member of the United Nations.133.	There are  however  some territories still under colonial domination  and the United Nations decolonization efforts must continue. The biggest challenge in the field of decolonization before the United Nations today is in southern Africa  where the repugnant policy of apartheid continues unabated and where colonialism still persists.134.	My delegation continues to believe that the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  endorsed in Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978)  constitutes the universally accepted basis for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian question. It is a matter of deep concern that extraneous issues  in particular the policy of linkage espoused by South Africa  continue to impede the implementation of the United Nations plan.135.	In the South Pacific  the leaders of the South Pacific Forum have kept the process of decolonization in New Caledonia under close review. The determination of the Administering Authority to introduce important reforms in that Territory is an important step forward. A further significant development is the willingness on the part of the Administering Authority to move to an act of self-determination in which the option of independence is included. These encouraging developments augur well for the political evolution of New Caledonia and are to be welcomed.136.	The international situation concerning disarmament efforts has not improved. Political tensions punctuated by military conflicts in almost all of the five continents continuously fuel an arms race and increase the risk of nuclear war.137.	Time has witnessed dramatic increases in the world resources devoted to military arms and research  justified  we are told  by the argument that such spending has the attainment of peace and security as its overall objective. This argument is fallacious. Instead of producing a safer and more secure world  increased military spending has only created increased insecurity.138.	The question of international security is as much our concern as it is that of the super-Powers. In this age of nuclear weapons and nuclear-weapon capabilities  security is the sum total of co-operation among all nations. Nuclear-weapon States therefore cannot ignore the concern of others whose future and that of their peoples are closely intertwined with that of the nuclear- weapon States.139.	In stressing the need for co-operation  especially among nuclear-weapon States  my Government looks to the ongoing strategic arms reduction talks  in Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union as the most important forum in which the two superpowers can show the political will to achieve disarmament by halting new developments and making substantial reductions in their nuclear weaponry.140.	Yet for many of us the road to a comprehensive programme of nuclear disarmament properly begins with a nuclear-weapon freeze. In our view  a freeze on nuclear arms would not only constitute an important first step in a disarmament process but would at the same time provide a favourable environment for negotiations such as START to be conducted in good faith and mutual trust. The structure and scope of such a nuclear arms freeze  we believe  should embrace a comprehensive  nuclear-weapons-test ban  the complete cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons  a ban on all further deployment of nuclear weapons  and the complete cessation of the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes.141.	My Government attaches great importance and urgency to the conclusion of a test-ban treaty. A comprehensive nuclear test ban within the overall objective of nuclear disarmament would contribute effectively towards controlling both horizontal and vertical proliferation. We therefore urge Member States  especially nuclear-weapon States  to respond positively to the proposal of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.142.	Further  in respect of a comprehensive test ban on nuclear weapons  Fiji associates itself fully with the other countries of the South Pacific in their opposition to  and condemnation of  the continued nuclear-weapon testing in our region by one of the major Powers.143.	Apart from the primary concern over the danger nuclear weapons and their use pose for the future of mankind  my Government is equally concerned with the effects of other aspects of nuclear weapons and energy on the environment generally. Proposals by some Pacific- rim countries for the dumping and storage of nuclear waste on coral atolls and the sea-bed of the Pacific Ocean is viewed with grave concern and a great deal of dismay and trepidation by my Government and its people. The inherent danger such schemes pose for the peoples of the Pacific who derive their livelihood from the sea is reflected in the adoption by all the Governments of the South Pacific Forum of a reaffirmation of their longstanding opposition to the dumping and storage of nuclear waste in the Pacific area.144.	The impasse in launching global negotiations and the consequent formulation of interim strategies for international economic negotiations is a matter of great concern for us all. But there has been considerable success in at least one area in the global negotiations  that of regulating international behaviour in the use of the oceans. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  opened for signature on 10 December 1982  represents a significant achievement in global negotiations and provides an example of what can be achieved if there is a political will to do so.145.	Now that the Convention has been adopted  its understanding and appreciation and  more importantly  its implementation should be underscored. It is as vital to the third world countries in the expansion of their national jurisdiction as it is to the industrialized nations in the exploration and exploitation of sea resources. We urge all Member States who have not ratified the Convention to do so and to work together towards its success.146.	In this respect  my Government requests that the Secretary-General be authorized to provide all the essential information concerning the Convention and  at the same time  to provide such assistance as is necessary to small developing countries in the development of their resources.147.	In small oceanic nations like Fiji  we place the greatest emphasis on the importance of the sea. It is for this reason that we were the first to ratify the Convention. We live with and by the sea. The sea constitutes one of our most vital resources. For many of us in the Pacific Islands  the development of the resources of our seas offers the only real hope for our economic well-being. 	"
"50",2410,"FRA",38,1983,"ï»¿30.	It is a great honour for me to address the Assembly.31.	Since the United Nations was foundedâand I have not forgotten that France was at San Francisco as one of the founding Membersâit has filled an essential role. Whatever results it may or may not have achieved  it has remained the one place where  in spite of set-backs and the eternal temptation to use force  peaceful solutions have been tirelessly sought. Through the testimony of that search and that perseverance it has become the symbol of all that is best in the international community .32.	I should like to pay a tribute  Mr. President  to the wisdom of the thirty-eighth session which  in electing you to preside over it  has underlined the important place occupied today by Panama  and also by Latin America.33.	It is my pleasure to reaffirm here the confidence of France in the Secretary-General; I have already met Mm several times in Paris  and my country has had the opportunity to appreciate his impartiality and talent and the high-minded approach he takes to his duties. The report he presented to the Assembly last year remains fresh in our memories. Like this year's report  it contained suggestions concerning the role of the Security Council  the reduction of tension  regional conflicts  disarmament  human rights and economic and social development  suggestions which I would solemnly endorse. It is on the subjects of disarmament and development that I shall now address the Assembly.34.	For more than 30 years a de facto peace based upon deterrence has prevailed between the great Powers of the northern hemisphere  whereas in various corners of the world conflicts have proliferated. There have been more than 100 such conflicts during this period. However  up to the 1970s  the world had the feeling that it was making progressâdifficult progress  uncertain progress  but nevertheless progress towards a less chaotic universe where  it was thought  underdevelopment would be overcome and peace would gain ground in the south as in the north. We now see that the gap is growing wider between the rich  who are growing ever richer in spite of the crisis  and the poor  who are growing ever poorer because of the crisis. Passing from one state of imbalance to another  the arms race is accelerating. Human rights are still being trampled under foot. All too many conflicts remain unresolved. One crisis succeeds another and each gives rise to anotherâeconomic  monetary  strategic and cultural. Before our very eyes the world is being remade by blood and the sword; might responds to might  and weakness entails further weakness.35.	Are we to despair of the efforts that have been made to find solutions for the problems of our world other than domination  violence or war? If the words uttered from this rostrum have any meaning  we cannot resign ourselves to that. Poverty and war are not inexorable  but the inevitable result of a false logic that we must join together to defeat. More than ever we need to realize that this must be done  at a time when fate is making a dramatic choice between peace and war.36.	Yet  what could be more simple than the hopes of the peoples of the worldâhopes centred on food  clothing  shelter  a free life  freedom from fear  access to knowledge  security of ownership and the ability to pass possessions on to one's children? However legitimate such hopes may be  are they  I should like to ask  too much to ask for?37.	Each of us  I believe  is convinced that the consequences of a new world war would be incalculable  perhaps irrevocable. But peace between nations can be maintained only on the basis of a genuine equilibrium. That is the lesson of history. It is through respect for this golden rule that the rights of all to independence and security are reconciled. To establish these equilibriums  or to re-establish them when they have been disturbed  to guarantee their stability  to reduce forces gradually to a lower and lower level  and to provide for continuous monitoring of the information providedâthat is the only possible approach to the problems that confront us.38.	In the recent past the negotiations between the Soviets and Americans on strategic arms limitation  known as SALT  have made it possible to limit certain technological developments and to slow down the qualitative strategic arms race  but at the same time we have seen a rapid development of the destructive capacity of these weapons  multiplication of the number of their warheads and improvements in their accuracy.39.	Thus the two great Powers  which each possess a central nuclear system of 2 000 to 3 000 delivery vehicles carrying 8 000 to 9 000 warheads  can attack each other and destroy each otherâif I may so put itâseven to eight times over.40.	One set of negotiations under way at Geneva is attempting to bring about a reduction of strategic intercontinental weapons with a view to bringing about a balance between American and Soviet armaments. France hopes that these negotiations will be successful  but for the time being world attention is focused on another set of negotiations  those dealing with what are known as intermediate nuclear forces. I should like to make my views on this subject absolutely clear.41.	As a result of continuous escalation on both sides on the ground in Europe  a new situation has come about in which today in our continent the Soviet Union alone possesses a considerable intermediate nuclear force of three-headed missiles which are mobile and accurate  with a range of about 5 000 kilometres  which  since they cannot cross the Atlantic  consequently have as their only possible target the nations of Western Europe. The same reasoning applies to the missiles installed in the Asian part of the Soviet Union  aimed at the States bordering on that region. France welcomed as a very positive act the opening at Geneva of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on weapons of this type  after the latter  in compliance with the twofold decision taken by the member States of the integrated North Atlantic Treaty Organization commandâa body to which France does not belongâmade plans to install Pershing II missiles and cruise missiles in various European countries at the end of this year.42.	I shall not here go into all the aspects of a debate which I have dealt with elsewhere and which does not involve France directly even if it concerns it. But I should like to make my country's position clear in the face of the request that its nuclear weapons be included with a view to a Euromissile balance of some kind. In this respect I recall that France  for a quarter of a century now  has possessed a nuclear deterrent force  defensive by its very nature  against any possible nuclear aggressor. That force forms a whole and constitutes for my country a central defence system essential to its security. A few figures will demonstrate its defensive character: each of the two major Powers today possesses 8 000 to 9 000 Warheads; France  for its part  possesses 98.1 am sure that is enough for our own deterrent  but it excludes the possibility of any other use. These 98 missiles are  furthermore  part of a strategic concept and not a tactical one  nor an intermediate concept  if we are to use the extremely precise vocabulary used by the Soviets and the Americans when discussing their own affairs.43.	Moreover  it would be paradoxical to have my own country depend on the results of a conference in which it is not participating and which  without its consent  would be debating strategic weapons  particularly underwater weapons  which neither the Americans nor the Russians  who possess many more of them  are debating among themselves  at least in that conference.44.	We can only compare what is comparable. The idea of weighing the central weapons system on which the independence and survival of my country rest against the intermediate nuclear forces of the two major Powers  which for them constitute a mere supplement to their formidable strategic arsenal  is unacceptable. Since in fact this is a request by the Soviet Union  on what grounds can that country expect France to give up something essential  namely its own national defence? Of course we are toldâand I am prepared to believe itâthat this is not the aim of the request. Of course we are promised that the inclusion of the French force at Geneva will in no way lead to its reduction. But if France were to enter into a calculation it has nothing to do with  would it not be running the risk of having the modernization of its means of defence placed under the control of others? Would it not be taking on a responsibility which it rejects  that of disrupting the world balance?45.	My country is independent. Its deterrent force obeys the orders of the President of the Republic alone. Its loyalty to the Atlantic alliance does not affect its autonomy. It respects the great Russian people and wishes to maintain the age-old good relations linking us. It has neither the intention nor the meansâand it does not wish for themâto impose its law by force of arms. It possesses weapons for its own defence  no more  no less. It would not understand a monopoly of intermediate nuclear forces in Europe being agreed to for the Soviet Union in particular  which is the case today  and it hopes that mutual concessions between the two Geneva partners will make it possible to end that monopoly  while creating conditions for a new balance  which I fervently hope for. This presupposes a continued tireless search for a midpoint from which we shall be able to see whether preference has been given to reduction of tensions rather than to their exacerbation.46.	However  since we must consider the whole picture  we must not forget that several conflicts  the direct or indirect results of the policy of blocs  or stirred up or aggravated by such a policy  are giving rise to concern.47.	The unjustifiable destruction of a South Korean civilian aircraft by a Soviet military aircraft leads us to deplore the contempt for moral standards and the tragic absence of laws strong enough to make the perpetration of such an act impossible. I hope that France's proposals to ICAO will finally be heeded.48.	But beyond this event  how many unacceptable situations exist  how many countries are occupied or threatened by foreign armies and how many peoples on all continents are prevented from choosing their own destiny  from Central America to South-East Asia  through Africa  the Middle East  central Asia and not forgetting Europe Let us stop; the list would be long. I am also thinking of these men and women throughout the world  in exile  refugees  political prisoners  victims of torture  those whose most elementary rights are flouted. On this latter point  surely the international community has been too sparing in its protests and sanctions  and finally has it not resigned itself to these crimes?With regard to the former point  has it shown enough intransigence whenever a people has been threatened or has lost the right to self-determination? This is a principle which brooks no exception. Where it is possible  why do we not envisage a process of disengagement which would confer a status of neutrality  once these three conditions are metâthe will of the State concerned  the evacuation of foreign forces and the solemn undertaking not to interfere in other countriesâunder the supervision of the Security Council?49.	But I should like to dwell on two conflicts in which France is involved: the conflict in Lebanon and the conflict in Chad. In Lebanon  the French are present as soldiers of peace  first within a United Nations force  the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  and later with three other countries at the request of the Lebanese Government  as part of a multinational force in Beirut to act as a buffer between the opposing forces there. Has it been forgotten that France contributed to the dignified departure of the Palestinian soldiers and then to protecting the survivors of the tragic Sabra and Shatila camps? We regarded this mission as an honour and we fulfilled it. As for the situation recently created by the partial withdrawal of the Israeli Army and by the new increase in lethal fighting involving civilian and foreign forces  we have tackled this task by placing ourselves at the service of peace. I proclaim loudly from this rostrum: France has no enemy in Lebanon. It is protecting its nationals  as it must. That is all. Its wish is for the Lebanese to manage to overcome their divisions within the framework of their institutions and respect for their legitimate authorities  for Lebanon to regain its independence  sovereignty and unity and for the United Nations to broaden its mission as soon as possible  if necessary  in line with the proposals of relevant leaders. Departure of the foreign armies will make it unnecessary to maintain an international security force.50.	As regards Chad  we went to that country at a time when it was the victim of external aggression  at the request of the Government recognized by the international community and in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and Security Council resolution 387 (1976). Our efforts today are aimed at mediation  and as a matter of priority mediation by the Organization of African Unity making possible a cease-fire between the opposing parties and the opening of negotiations the primary purpose of which would be to guarantee the integrity of Chad and the withdrawal of foreign armies. Then  I assure the Assembly  France will not delay by one hour the repatriation of its troops. I have mentioned the OAU  thus indicating France's interest in regional efforts  which are an excellent way of dealing with the conflicts. I could have praised  in this regard  the action undertaken in another part of the world by the Contadora Group  and I can think of many other examples.51.	It is time  at this stage of my statement  to come back to strategic nuclear armaments in the world. We cannot reject the ideaâand I do notâthat the five nuclear Powers should together debate  when the time comes  a permanent limitation of their strategic systems. We must therefore set out clearly the conditions for progress in this field.52.	The first of these conditions is the correction of the fundamental difference  in terms of type and quantity  between the armaments of the two major Powers and those of the others  and the difference between a country that might use them to assert its power and a country which might be forced to make use of them for its own survival.53.	The second condition flows from the wide gap between conventional forces  particularly in Europe  a gap which has become even wider  I fear  because of the existence of chemical and biological weapons  the manufacture and stockpiling of which must be prohibited by a convention.54.	The third condition is the cessation of the escalation in anti-missile  anti-submarine and anti-satellite weapons.55.	It is also essential to safeguard peoples against threats from space. Is space to become an additional Held for the limitless development of the old earthly antagonisms? Space is surely by its very essence the common heritage of mankind  as the Earth itself should be. It would be a betrayal of the interests of our peoples if we were to fail to define  in time  a code of law which would preserve it.56.	Now there is no curb on the development of antimissile weapons in space  no limit to the number of satellites  because only weapons of mass destructionâthat is  nuclear weaponsâare banned by the 1967 Treaty.' An amendment to that Treaty which banned the placing in orbit of any type of weapon  brought about the gradual withdrawal of arms already in orbit and provided for effective verification would give it its proper scope.57.	In another field which concerns us  and whatever may be the controversies about its testsâcontroversies with which I am familiarâI wish to stress that France has decided to open its underground nuclear test sites next month to a fact-finding visit from foreign scientists from the South Pacific. I hope this example will be followed.58.	I shall end this part of my statement as I began it  that is  with Europe. If peace has reigned in this continent since the Second World War  it has been in a Europe divided  rent asunder  and which has barely invented ways and means of protecting its future and its own security. No true European will renounce the possibility of doing away with the consequences of this division  renewing the ties that were Oroken and repairing the situation born in Yalta. It was with this in mind that France worked for the success of the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and will continue to work for the success of the conference in Stockholm. Only good mutual knowledge of military activities throughout the region stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals will restore the conditions for greater trust.59.	I would recall that the relations between France and Germany were very important in laying the foundations for the European Community  thus making war unthinkable among the 300 million West Europeans. This commitment and this experience explain our support for any process which would ensure increased security for all Europeans. Believe me  the contagion of peace can overcome the consequences of war.60.	The States represented here are going through the worst recession afflicting their economies in the last 50 years. The crisis affects us all. The upsurge  sometimes remarkable and always difficult  experienced by the developing world has been halted. While in certain industrialized countries there are signs of a recovery  the difficulties are getting worse for the majority. The burden of the pastâthat is  the burden of debtâis being added to the uncertainties of the present to impose upon the fragile societies efforts at austerity and discipline which are exceptionally severe.61.	Of course  we must improve public finances. Of course  we must reduce deficits which are too high. But When the solution to the economic crisis only exacerbates it  where are the signs of a cure? When the increase in poverty and hunger sows the seeds of social and political crises  surely the difficulties are increasing. When the North is content with its own recovery  does it believe for a moment that it can find lasting well-being alone? What does it propose to those who are living today and what does it propose for the 2 billion men and women who will be born within the next 15 years? Silence has become the ally of the worst. Let us all resume dialogue between the two hemispheres. Let us urgently respond and lay down firm foundations for the future.62.	A transfer of resources from the countries of the North to those of the South is a natural course and is desirable for the well-being of all. The present levels of aid should be considered irreversible. The principal donors should undertake not to reduce their aid as long as the recipient countries show no sign of economic growth. The banking sector must be encouraged not to slacken its efforts.63.	But these immediate actions will not spare us damage to our societies if the currencies in which the third world debt is payable and the interest rates on this debt reach excessive levels. It is up to each industrialized country to shoulder its responsibilities.64.	France  for its part  is making steady progress towards the aid target it has fixed for itself: 0.7 per cent of its gross national product for the third world  0.15 per cent for the least developed countries. We intend to do everything possible to see to it that the seventh replenishment of the International Development Association represents a significant increase. We snail continue to give our support to the Paris Club to seek ways of dealing with the most critical situations of indebtedness. We support the idea of an increase in the resources of IMF to be assigned as a matter of priority to the developing countries.65.	We have to attack the deep-rooted causes of the instability and disarray which mark international economic relations. For my part there are three major priorities: currency  primary commodities and technology.66.	If I begin with currency it is because  after all  it is the main primary commodity. A few months ago I put forward the idea of a new Bretton Woods. This was a symbolic reference  as far as I was concerned  to stress the need to recreate the conditions of an ordered monetary system with currencies sufficiently stable and reflecting the actual evolution of economies. That is a need felt by us all. The Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of New Zealand were right to issue an appeal for international monetary co-operation. The seven industrialized countries decided at Williamsburg to consider the role that could be played at the right time by a monetary conference with a view to improving the international monetary system. This  I know  is something that will take a great deal of time and requires very thorough preparation  and all the countries interested must be involved in this enterprise. Consideration of stricter rules for the establishment of exchange parities  diversification of reserve instruments  agreement on a rate of evolution of international liquidities  definition of the necessary disciplines in the light of the specific economic and social situations of each countryâthese are the principal subjects to which thought should be given.67.	With regard to primary commodities  the path was laid by the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade last June. But the matter cannot rest there. France proposes improvement of the functioning of private commodity markets by regularizing futures markets  which too often by .their erratic and speculative movement mislead economic agents instead of informing them. Stricter discipline Li the area of competition would return those markets to their proper role. And I stress that vital primary commodity  energy. The current stabilization of the oil markets in no way diminishes the importance of encouraging the financing of investment in non-renewable energy sources  whether through the World Bank or any other specialized agency.68.	Over and above the difficult situations it has created  the crisis has made it possible for us to understand the growing role of technical progress. It is certainly necessary to make constant efforts at adaptation  but it also offers exceptional opportunities for the development of the South and the progress of the North. This fact seems obvious  and yet too often some countries tend to consider that this is their own business  as if technical progress were a privilege reserved for the richest  the cleverest or the most advanced. We are well aware that nothing is more ambivalent than technical progressâa source of growth but also a decisive element in the arms race. Are we to remain content with this finding? Are we to concede that the major efforts of the biggest countries must be devoted to military technology? Are we to concede that the overwarming of the planet should prevail over its development? This is the most important question  and it is becoming ever more acute from one generation to the next. It is something which has been unceasingly asked in and by France  and not France alone. From the beginning of the century Jean Jaures  Albert Thomas  Eduard Herriot  Aristide Briand and Leon Blum each in turn tried to banish the threat of a modern war and to work for disarmament. They carried further the inextinguishable hope  hope that has resisted all set-backs.69.	The world will recover its equilibrium and security only if solidarityâwhich today  unfortunately  is expressed in military termsâassumes another dimension  for solidarity is the higher form of security. But how are we to give expression to it? The General Assembly has already repeatedly reaffirmed the link between the tasks of development and the endeavour to achieve disarmament  between the rejection of poverty and the rejection of arms escalation. Our Governments  in spite of their differences on the approaches to disarmament and security  would surely subscribe to the disarmament-development link and the establishment of an international fund which would make it possible to give effect to this. France itself has put forward suggestions along these lines: as far back as 1955 by the Government of Mr. Edgard Faure  who is here today  and in 1978  on the initiative of my predecessor  during the first special session on disarmament.70.	To deal with the problem of over armament at its roots and put disarmament at the service of development  it is not enoughâalthough of course the idea may be supportedâto seek to use for the benefit of the countries of the South a tax levied on military budgets or procurement expenditures. The prolonged crisis we have experienced leads us to adopt a global approachâor should lead us to adopt a global or  more precisely  a political approach. We have to go back to the origin of these expenditures  that is  the close and growing link between military insecurity and economic insecurity which characterizes the world today. By a series of paradoxes  the deregulation of the international economic system strengthens the need for security and by the same token fuels the arms race  which  in its turn  causes disequilibrium. In view of this  the following essential tasks must be tackled. First of all  we have to determine the true weight of armaments  and urgent questions arise: for example  how to overcome differences in terms of both data and estimates; how to work out a basis of evaluation acceptable to all. Next  we must assess the internal and external economic effects of the increase in military expenditures. Thirdly  how do we judge the relationship between the increase of military expenditure and the major factors of international economic disorder? Finally  while clarifying the above points  the essential issue is the possibility and the means of carrying out the tasks of interest to mankind as a whole  those concerning health  vocational training and agricultural development in the third worldâto all of which we must devote the sizeable resources that would be released by a gradual but methodical reduction in military expenditures in the principal countries. And there is also the question of how we are to ensure favourable economic effects of these reductions and conversions in the contributing countries themselves  and how to devise mechanisms to assist in this switch to disarmament and development.71.	Each country can provide only a partial response to these major questions  but no country can escape them. Indeed  what country today can deny that after 10 yearsâ sometimes even longerâof crisis the patterns of military expenditure are creating increasing difficulties for it? What is the point of spending more for less security  whether military or economic? That is the fundamental question which everyone has to face. It is a question which I wanted to bring before you.72.	All countries have an interest in this important debate which transcends our differences  but since what is essential in this Held depends upon a small number of States  I think it desirable that action should be taken in two stages. In the first stage there should be  as early as possible  a meeting on the problem posed by the link between disarmament and development and the creation of an international fund provided for by the General Assembly. When the major military Powers have announced their agreement  France is ready to be host to such a conference in Paris. As a second stage  representatives of the Governments participating in that meeting could set themselves the task of preparing a United Nations conference  which would be open to all Members of the Organization  and that preparatory meeting could  without delay  define an initial series of targets to be reached for transfers for the benefit of development.73.	In the words and logic of the time  the Prime Minister of France  Mr. Pierre Mendes-France  appealed in 1954  at the 498th meeting of the General Assembly  for co-operation between the Eastern and the Western Powers. ""By making them partners in life-giving tasks  it is bound to deflect them from the path of death. By facilitating and promoting exchanges among them  it may break down impassable barriers  clarify mysteries and dispel distrust.""74.	I myself  30 years laterâand the weight of facts having now become almost unbearableâwish to state that no country can avoid this debate.75.	Let us begin now to free ourselves from our acquired reflexes  from fear  from mistrust  from habits of which we ourselves are the first victims  and embark on this common endeavour. "
"51",2480,"GAB",38,1983,"ï»¿63.	As has become customary each year at this time  the general debate gives us the invaluable opportunity to summarize the political and economic situation in the world as it has developed since the last session and thus to assess together the progress achieved by the Organization in the interval.63. We wish first to welcome very warmly the delegation of the republic of Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission as the 158th Member of the Organization. We offer that brotherly country a welcome to our midst  and we know that we can count on its contribution in the common search for the advent of a better world of solidarity and peace.66.	When the Charter of the United Nations was adopted 38 years ago the most urgent task given to the Organization was the establishment of peace in a world devastated and exhausted by a great war. Since that time the Organization has constantly and untiringly worked to create a political and economic framework which would be better for mankind. In spite of that noble ideal  the certainty of living in peace is still beyond our grasp today. Indeed  a review of recent years shows that the principles laid down in the Charter have not been respected  just as certain achievements have remained inconclusive. Violence  conflicts with no declaration of war  the temptation to resort to the threat or use of force  the unbridled pursuit of selfish interests by certain Members of the Organizationâthese are all irreconcilable with the restraint and moderation which should be the dominant characteristics of our time. They destroy the universal dream of the development of the whole of mankind and the flourishing of the human person in the enjoyment of fundamental rights.67.	The deep tensions and murderous conflicts which thus characterize international life make us aware  first  of the hegemonistic struggles undertaken by the major Powers which  under the pretext of strengthening their security  ceaselessly pursue the arms race despite their public statements in favour of detente and peace. These tensions also testify to the persistence of the other scourges of colonialism and	that most repugnant and barbaric form of racism. Finally  we have the selfishness of partisans of the present economic order  and that is not the least of the causes of the crisis situation which the world is experiencing today  whether in southern Africa  especially Namibia  Iraq and Iran  the Middle East or South-East Asia  to mention just the main areas.68.	In southern Africa we note with regret that interference by the major Powers and their attempts to impose solutions in keeping with their own strategic interests are complicating and delaying the settlement of the last colonial questions  particularly the question of Namibia.69.	Regarding Namibia  we note that in spite of Security Council resolutions 435 (1978)  439 (1978) and 532 (1983)  this problem remains at an impasse because of the introduction of matters which are totally unrelated to the process of decolonization. My country remains convinced that peace in Namibia can be achieved only within the framework of the strict implementation of the United Nations settlement plan. That is why my delegation rejects any linkage between the accession of Namibia to national sovereignty and the departure of Cuban troops from Angola. Those troops are in Angola under bilateral agreements concluded in complete sovereignty and in conformity with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.70.	Still speaking of Africa  my country continues to be concerned over two hotbeds of tension there  Western Sahara and Chad. In this connection I shall leave it to others to recall the efforts made by the head of State of Gabon  Mr. Omar Bongo  concerning negotiations in these disputes. I hope that  thanks to the structures already established by the Organization of African Unity  the parties to these conflicts will finally agree to sit at the same table to settle these problems through dialogue  in order to bring peace and security to the whole of the African continent.71.	Two brother countries  Iraq and Iran  with which Gabon has excellent relations  are still fighting. This means an indefinite prolongation of the suffering of the peoples in that region. Once again we solemnly appeal to the leaders of those two brother countries to put an end  through a negotiated solution  to this war which is a dangerous threat to peace and security in the entire Gulf region and which contains the seeds of a world conflagration. Moreover  we hail all those who are concerned with and aware of the need for establishing a climate of peace in these two countries and who work untiringly to that end. I refer in particular to the Islamic Peace Committee for its sustained efforts to reach a just  honourable and definitive solution to this conflict. We also commend the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General to achieve that solution. Similarly  we congratulate the International Red Cress Committee which  in spite of many obstacles  is continuing to carry out its humanitarian mission.72.	In the Middle East  Israel's systematic refusal to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people constitutes an inadmissible hindrance to the process of detente in the region. It must be remembered that the right to independence and self-determination implies taking into account the direct aspirations of the peoples involved. No just and lasting peace is possible in this part of the world until Israel realizes that the use of force will never be able to shake the determination nor the will of a people seeking self-determination and independence.73.	Gabon  for its part  reaffirms its total support for the relevant resolutions of the United Nations concerning the rights of the people of Palestine.74.	I would reiterate that peace in the region remains closely linked to the negotiated settlement of the Palestinian problem  and it also involves the recognition of the right of each of the peoples in this region to live in peace and security within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.75.	With reference to the situation in Lebanon  in the same region  we call upon all the parties to exercise statesmanship and good will and to examine the situation realistically  in order to put an end to the martyrdom of the Lebanese people  who should be the sole master of their own destiny. We also support the efforts of President Amin Gemayel to enable Lebanon to recover sovereignty over the whole of its territory  free from any foreign military presence of any origin.76.	In South-East Asia  peace remains linked to the solution of the problem of Kampuchea. The solution to this problem must involve respect for the principles of territorial integrity  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and the non-use of force.77.	The same is true of Afghanistan  which should be left free to determine its own destiny  and of the Korean peninsula where we have always hoped to see the peaceful reunification of the country without foreign interference. We accordingly endorse the steps taken by the Secretary- General to resolve the crises which are disrupting these regions  in particular by obtaining guarantees on the non- use of force against the political independence of any of those States.78.	It goes without saying that the world is following with concern the various tensions and conflicts which are becoming an increasing threat to the future of all mankind. We might well ask whether detente and disarmament are now mere illusions. The escalation of the arms race has taken on a new dimension  both quantitatively and qualitatively  because of the lack of will of the major Powers who have the technology and capital.79.	In 1982 the military expenditures of the United States and the Soviet Union alone  with their respective alliancesâthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pactâaccounted for close to two thirds of all the military expenditures recorded in the entire world  or over $700 billion. That money would have been better spent on the pressing development needs  thus contributing to banishing the spectres of poverty  misery and hunger which even today are still causing the deaths of thousands and thousands of men  women and children.80.	Furthermore  the lack of a clear political will on the part of the major Powers with regard to such a vital question for mankind means that the development of new nuclear and conventional weapons continues uninterrupted and the negotiations on disarmament in the United Nations have not led to any agreement.81.	It is clear that this widespread arms race and the need for the developing countries to devote large amounts of money to their own defence increase the political and economic dependence of those countries on the more militarily powerful States and deprives them of substantial resources which could have been devoted to improving the living standards of their peoples. Nevertheless  in a spirit of optimism  my country endorses the work already being done in disarmament with hope of inducing the parties to adopt a much more conciliatory and positive attitude.82.	Unfortunately  it is not just political problems with which we are concerned. Indeed  the international economic situation  characterized by a world-wide depression whose well-known causes are both circumstantial and structural  is  especially for the third world countries  a continuing cause of anguish and anxiety  fully justified recently by the annual report of the World Bank  which emphasizes the bleak prospects for our economies.83.	Beyond the circumstantial aspects  the Gabon delegation believes that this crisis is above all structural because of the rigid positions systematically adopted by the wealthy countries in refusing to adjust their economic structures to the new requirements of today's world economy.84.	The slowdown in world trade  more particularly between North and South  is such that many developing countries  especially in Africa  are seriously affected by this crisis because of the precariousness of their economic structures  which are very dependent upon a small number of commodities  or even on a single commodity. In 1980  for example  of the 32 non-oil producing countries deriving more than 50 per cent of their export income from a single one of the 18 products listed in the Integrated Programme for Commodities  20 were African. As a result  their economies are extremely vulnerable to fluctuation in the prices of their export products. Indeed  since the end of the last world war  relative commodity prices have dropped by over 14 per cent  falling to their lowest level ever. One ton of coffee or one ton of cotton  for example  now permits the purchase of only half the capital goods that could have been purchased in exchange for them 20 years ago.85.	The present crisis is so serious that the developing countries are forced to postpone implementation of their programmes for economic and social development or purely and simply to give them up.86.	The deterioration in the terms of trade resulting from the fluctuations in the prices of raw materials has gravely compromised the savings and investment capacities of the poor countries  thus increasing their indebtedness  which now amounts to more than $600 billion. At the same time  the servicing of their debts has suffered the blow of too-high interest rates. At present it amounts to more than $100 billionâa figure clearly higher than the capital now coming into their economies. Moreover  there has been a net decrease  in real terms  in the official development assistance.87.	The perpetuation of the present crisis situation is a serious obstacle to the economic independence of these countries and works against their self-sustaining and self-reliant development  as defined in 1980 in the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa and in the Final Act of Lagos. Thus  if the crisis is to be overcome and the world economy to be started up again  it is important not only to promote the idea of the creation of a new liquidity to make profound changes in the present international economic system  but also to determine where the responsibility lies. And there cannot be the slightest doubt that it is the industrialized countries of the North which have this responsibility; their sole watchword must be: to trade a bit more with the third world in order to bring about the complete integration of the South in international trade.88.	In this regard  many readjustments must be made in the world economy  in the general interest. That requires a global approach to the problems between the developed and the developing regions  in order to draw up the blueprints for joint action in the areas of commodities  manufactured goods  currency and finance.89.	With regard to primary commodities  we are convinced that putting the Common Fund for Commodities into effect is still the driving force for the implementation of the Integrated Programme for Commodities. This is a body based on a new concept. It is both integrated  because it seeks to co-ordinate the financing of various policies for the stockpiling of commodities  and global  because in addition to price stability it meets the concern for managing the supply of commodities by greater participation in processing  marketing and transport. These aspects account for the innovative nature of the Fund.90.	As for manufactured and semi-manufactured products  everything must be done to establish a new international division of labour based on the necessary complementarity between countries at different levels of development.91.	In respect of monetary and financial problems  the present indebtedness of the third world countries requires a redefinition of assistance. Thus  the diversity of the channels used to ensure the transfer of real resources necessitates joint efforts by developing and developed countries. The need for large-scale action to restructure the debt of the developing countries  such as the establishment of some financing facility or the partial or total cancellation of the debt of the least developed countries  is based on the idea that the disequilibrium in the developing countries' balance of payments arises not so much from an excess of demand as from basic rigidities  the elimination of which implies accelerated growth and diversification of the productive structure.92.	At the same time  we must not lose sight here of the necessity for  on the one hand  strengthening the resources of IMF by urging the United States Congress to agree on 30 November this year to increase United States contributions to the Fund and  on the other hand  closer co-operation between the Fund and the World Bank when a country has trouble coping with its structural deficiencies and with the current excessively high interest rates. Naturally  this requires reworking the structures of the Bank  as well as broadening the role of the Fund  which up to now has limited itself to assisting in the rescheduling of balances of payments rather than acting as an arbiter of the world monetary system.93.	Hence  the proposals and solutions advocated in the common interest should be global. The developing countries are calling for international economic relations based on equal rights  with priority being given to joint efforts and multilateral agreements.94.	The present impasse in the global negotiations and  even more striking  the failure last June of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development once again demonstrate the industrialized countries' negative attitude and their inability to take urgent joint measures to overcome the general crisis and to strengthen the world economy in the interest of all. Faced with that obstinate desire of some countries to freeze the North-South dialogue  the developing countries must understand that in order to fight poverty and seriously develop their economies they must strengthen their unity and mutual assistance  increase their self-sufficiency and promote South-South co-operation. To enable the developing countries to achieve those goals the developed countries are duty bound to honour the commitments they have made in various international forums as part of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Thus  their agreement to the rapid relaunching of global negotiations would significantly contribute to implementing that Strategy.93. The task  we agree  is immense and difficult. Nevertheless  we have no doubt but that this thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly will harness its energies above all in order to achieve substantial progress in the areas of political and economic relations  disarmament and the settlement of open or still-brewing conflicts which threaten collective peace and security. That  in any event  is the deep conviction of the Government of Gabon and its head of State  Mr. Omar Bongo.96.	I could not finish this address without paying a sincere tribute to the Secretary-General and to all those who  like him  are devotedly contributing to the achievement of the noble ideals of the Charter of the United Nations and to the safeguarding of its fundamental principles.97.	May I also express my delegation's wholehearted appreciation and thanks to Mr. Imre Hollai  Deputy Foreign Minister of Hungary  for the selflessness and competence with which he fulfilled his duties.98.	And  finally  how could I not take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Illueca on his election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session? His election is testimony not only to his outstanding talents as a statesman but also to the great esteem and respect which the international community as a whole has for his country  linked to my own by that same determination to pursue the useful work already begun by his predecessors with admirable courage and determination  in order to contribute  within the great family of the peoples of the United Nations  to the safeguard of the ideals of peace  freedom and independence. We are already assured that under his presidency the Organization will have even more outstanding successes and that even more important steps will be taken along the road of the permanent quest for the peace and security which mankind so desperately wants.99.	These congratulations are also addressed to the other members of the General Committee  whose collaboration will be most valuable to the President. It is also a pleasure for me to assure the President of the complete co-operation of the delegation of Gabon in ensuring that the work of the thirty-eighth session will conclude successfully.   "
"52",2525,"GBR",38,1983,"ï»¿150.	 Mr. President  may I begin by joining other speakers in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. You have my best wishes for the difficult task which lies ahead of you. May I also express my thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Hollai  who has so ably fulfilled his role on behalf of the Assembly.151.	It gives me particular pleasure to pay a tribute also to the Secretary-General. We owe a great deal already to his careful authority and leadership. His report to last year's session' brought out in a striking way the gravity of the problems facing us in the United Nations. His report this year has again underlined the crucial problem of trust. He has also drawn our attention to the need for the Secretary-General  in the interests of all  to exercise tighter control over the administration of the Organization. It is now up to us to do something about these problems. As my predecessor said last year  the blame for the state of the world does not lie with the United Nations system or with the Charter  but with us  the Member States. I endorse that conclusion wholeheartedly  but I see absolutely no evidence that it has sunk in.152.	This is my first year as a foreign minister. But it is a reflection of today's increasingly complex and interdependent world that this year has not by any means been my first taste as a minister of international affairs.153.	My own particular experience has been in international economic and financial affairs  and I have learned from that one very clear lesson: the problems which face us can effectively be tackled only through close international co-operation and  of course  with the necessary determination and patience. If that is true  as it is  of economic and social questions  it must be even more so in the political field  where major questions of peace and security are at stake.154.	Economic and political problems are  of course  often interlinked. Indeed  the former can cause  or exacerbate  the latter. That is why foreign ministers  even if they were so minded  cannot fail to concern themselves with economic questions. These are  of course  questions which require effective action at the national level  and national determination to solve  but the need for action on the international plane is no less clear.155.	So  as a foreign minister  I remain very interested in what is happeningâand what is not happeningâin the world economy. There are signs of recovery in my country and in others  but complacency and over-confidence would be equally damaging to the prospects of sustained non-inflationary growth: complacency because there will not be much growth if we rest on the laurels of our achievements so far; and over-confidence because growth will not be sustained if we abandon the fight against inflation. The consequences of inflation  of inflated expectations and of over-ambitious and over-promising governments  are still very much with us  in particular  the problems of debt and the pressures to resort to quick and wrong solutions  like protectionism. It will take patience as well as energy to ensure that they are safely overcome.156.	On the whole  I am optimistic. While vast problems remain  there have been encouraging signs that many members of the international community recognize that we are all affected by the same economic conditions and are ready to respond to the challenge of joint action. For example  the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund was able to reach agreement in February on an increase in quotas and a parallel enlargement of the General Arrangements to Borrowâan agreement which would not have been possible if all parties had not been willing to show considerable flexibility. It remains vitally important for countries to take legislative action necessary to implement their increased quotas so that IMF can be more effective.157.	Some of these problems are technical  or perhaps it is just that they are made to sound that way by the economists who propose solutions in a language which does not always make for easy understanding. But the underlying reality shines through any amount of jargon: we need to restore the balance and vitality of the world economy in order to provide a rising standard of living  and above all to meet the basic human needs of the people of the world for food  shelter and a decent standard of life.158.	For the last decade  the world has been proving Malthus wrong  but only justâworld agricultural production has kept slightly ahead of population increase. But this conceals the fact that in many countries agricultural production per capita has stagnated or declined. Experience shows that the opposite can be achieved where policy is directed to encouraging individual enterprise and more widespread use of appropriate technology.159.	Population policy must be part of the answer  and progress has already been made. But much more needs to be done. We should give a high priority to this since it is the poorest people who will benefit most. Aid too has a vital part to play  but food aid is only first aid. The main requirement is for aid to increase production where it is most needed  and it is on this that the international community should concentrate.160.	Production alone is not enough. We cannot afford not to make the best use of the resources at our disposal  and therefore we cannot afford to relent in the fight against protectionism. Barriers to trade are barriers to economic efficiency and the creation of wealth. We all need to fight more resolutely against them. There must be no new upward twist to the spiral of protection. Instead  I should like to see a vigorous programme of commercial disarmament.161.	I have mentioned the word' 'disarmament'' in an unusual context. That is not because I underrate its importance in the more normal one. Indeed  nothing could illustrate more vividly the link between the economic and the political world. 162.	Without security there can be no lasting prosperity; arms control and disarmament can contribute to both by reducing at the same time the risks of war and the burden of defence costs.163.	It would  of course  be madness to turn our backs on such a prospect  or to reduce our efforts to achieve so obviously beneficial a result. In theory  there is no doubt that agreements can be reached which will bring lasting economic and military benefit to both sides.164.	Over the last two decades there have been practical examples of successful agreements between East and West  which should encourage us to persevere in our efforts. But history shows also that the road is not an easy one: confidence is hard to build up and all too easy to destroy; secrecy inevitably breeds suspicion; and the stake: are high enough to underline the need for caution.165.	But caution should not prevent movement  and on the Western side  at least  it has not. President Reagan has proposed major cuts in strategic missiles and the elimination of a whole class of intermediate range missiles. Speaking from this podium only two days ago he revealed a further package of steps designed to advance the negotiations as rapidly as possible. These are radical measures by any standards  and they have our support. So do the Western proposals to reduce the forces facing each other in central Europe to a common ending. We have put forward proposals of our own trying nearer a ban on chemical weapons. It is dear that the West means business over disarmament. It is now up to the Russians to respond.166.	Our objective in these and other negotiations is simple: we want realistic  balanced and verifiable measures of arms control and disarmament which will enhance peace and securityânot just for ourselves  but for all participants. We do not seek unilateral advantage  nor shall we give in to those who seek it at our expense.167.	That  for the moment  is what the Soviet Union is trying to do by claiming that British and French systems should be included in the intermediate-range nuclear force negotiations. The two participants in the negotiations  the United States and the Soviet Union  have agreed that their own strategic systems should be excluded. There can be no reason in equity or logic why the strategic systems of non-participants should be included. The Soviet attempt to suggest otherwise should perhaps be dismissed as a smokescreen designed to hide what I hope is only a temporary unwillingness to negotiate seriously.168.	Taken literally  what the Soviet leaders are asking for is either the unilateral strategic disarmament of Britain and France or a monopoly of intermediate-range missiles in Europe at the expense of the United States and its allies. These demands are unacceptable and will remain soâ not because British weapon systems would be affected  but because what is proposed is unbalanced and inequitable and would benefit one side at the expense of the other.169.	When it comes to arms control and disarmament  we in Britain claim no special privileges and no sanctuary. The record makes this clear  and we remain ready to play a full part in the arms control and disarmament process.170.	As far as the British deterrent is concerned  we must naturally take into account that our force is a strategic one and that it represents less than 3 per cent of the strategic nuclear forces available to the United States or to the Soviet Union. It would be absurd as things stand for us to seek to trade reductions with a superpower. But we have never said ""never"". On the contrary  we have made it clear that  if Soviet and United States strategic arsenals were to be very substantially reduced and if no significant changes had occurred in Soviet defensive capabilities  Britain would want to review its position and to consider how best it could contribute to arms control in the light of the reduced threat. That remains our position.171.	I have spent some time on the subject of arms control and disarmament because it is one which is rightly at the centre of the international stage and rightly of concern to the United Nations and its Member States. But  as Mrs. Thatcher made clear when she addressed the twelfth special session of the General Assembly in June 1982 the causes of war do not lie in the existence of particular weapons  whether nuclear or conventional  or even in particular numbers of weapons. They lie in the disposition of States to ignore international law and to seek to impose change on others by resort to force.172.	We in Britain had direct experience of this last year  when Argentina invaded the Falklands in flagrant violation of one of the most fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. That invasion has not faded into history. We  for our part  have upheld and will continue to uphold the principles of the Charter. We will defend the Falkland Islands and their inhabitants against the possibility of renewed attack; our military dispositions are designed solely for this purpose. We will continue to defend the rightâthe inalienable rightâof the people of the Falkland Islands to self-determination  a right to which they are no less entitled than other small island peoples  and we will carry forward economic and constitutional development in close consultation with the islanders.173.	At the same time  we shall continue to seek a more normal relationship with Argentina and a reduction of tension in the South Atlantic. We have played a constructive part in international efforts to help with the problem of Argentine debt. It was very much at our initiative that progress has been achieved in the removal of bilateral financial restrictions. We look to Argentina to honour the agreement that has been reached. We would like to do the same in the commercial and economic fields and have supported the initiative of the European Community to this effect. We have also taken other initiatives intended to promote the development of a more normal bilateral relationship.174.	The return for these efforts  I regret to say  has not been encouraging. The Argentine authorities have shown no regret at their resort to the use of force  no interest in reducing tension and no response to these various initiatives from the British side aimed at restoring a better relationship between our two countries. They continue to see negotiations purely as a means for transferring sovereignty without regard for the wishes of the islanders. A radical change of approach is required in Buenos Aires.175.	The lengthy passage on the Falklands in the statement of the Foreign Minister of Argentina consisted of rhetoric which is as unhelpful as it is tendentious. His reference to respecting the existing cessation of hostilities has yet to be translated into a convincing and dependable renunciation of the use of force. The whole world knows who stands rightly convicted of deception and of dangerous military adventures. The Argentine invasion  launched without warning when we were negotiating in good faith  cannot be wished away. I can understand why the Argentine representative found it too embarrassing to mention. To accuse us of threatening the security of the Latin American region is lurid nonsense; we have done and will do no more than is necessary to protect the Islands and their population against a threat which recent history has shown to be all too real and which the current pattern of Argentine arms purchases seems designed to keep alive.176.	As for the charge of colonialism  the answer can be seen by looking round this chamber. Britain's record speaks for itself. Only a few days ago  in response to the freely expressed wishes of the people exercising their right to self-determination  we gave independence to the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis. I congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on becoming  last week  the 158th Member of this Organization and the 48th member of that unique association of nations  the Commonwealth. The strength of the Commonwealth will once again be reaffirmed when its heads of Government meet in November at New Delhi.177.	It is sad that so many of the political problems which confronted us last year are no less acute now. The Middle East is a prime example. Violence and the rule of force are the order of the day. There is not much time left for peaceful change. The United Kingdom was greatly disappointed  especially after the initial response from the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez on 25 November 1981 and 9 September 1982  that the proposals put forward by President Reagan on 1 September 1982' were not taken up by the parties. They offered a realistic starting point for negotiations aimed at reconciling the right of Israel to live within secure and recognized borders with the right of the Palestinian people to determine their own future.178.	Only through negotiation will there be a just and lasting solution to the Arab-Israel dispute. But we are a long way from a negotiation  and we shall stay a long way as long as the parties do not take the first steps to build mutual confidence and trust. On each side there is a long-canvassed step which could transform the picture: for Israel  to halt its policy of building illegal settlements in occupied territory; for the Arabs  including the Palestinians  to show that they are ready to accept Israel's right to live in peace and security.179.	Efforts to tackle the central issue of the future of the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza have been diverted by events in Lebanon. This is a tragedy for Middle East peace  but it is a greater tragedy for the people of Lebanon. Let us be honest about this: Lebanon has internal problems which would be difficult enough to solve in conditions of peace. It has no chance of solving them as long as it is at the mercy of foreign forces. That is why we shall continue to support all efforts to restore Lebanon's sovereignty and independence and to secure the withdrawal of all foreign forces from that country. The presence of a small contingent of British troops in Beirut is a symbol of that support.180.	Israel's invasion of Lebanon last year has  predictably enough  solved nothing. On the contrary  it has led only to more suffering  while making even more difficult the essential process of national reunification. Meanwhile  the Syrian refusal to withdraw  despite the clear wishes of the Lebanese Government  only prolongs the agony and increases the risk of partition. I warmly welcome the declaration of a cease-fire and the intention of all parties to pursue a dialogue aimed at reconciliation of the various communities. The important thing now is for this to be implemented fully and faithfully by all concerned.181.	Sadly  conflict in the Middle East is not an isolated phenomenon. In the Gulf we shall support all efforts to end the bloody war between Iran and Iraq. The work of the Secretary-General's mission of inquiry provides a starting-point for a consensus. Meanwhile  members of the international community should avoid any action which could extend or increase the level of conflict in the area.182.	This is an appropriate place to mention also two other issues with which the United Nations remains closely concerned: Korea and Cyprus. The best prospect of peaceful reunification in Korea lies in direct talks between the two sides. The Republic of Korea has made clear its positive approach. It is high time that it received a constructive response from Pyongyang. In this context let me repeat my Government's total condemnation of the shooting down by the Soviet Union of a South Korean civilian airliner. What is essential now is full redress and effective arrangements to avoid such incidents in future. We will work strenuously to this end in ICAO.183.	In Cyprus the United Nations has been tireless in its efforts to promote a settlement. The Secretary-General has this year increased his personal involvement. My Government welcomes this and stands ready to help in every appropriate way. Despite some limited progress in the intercommunal talks held under United Nations auspices  a peaceful and lasting settlement regrettably still seems to be a long way off. I cannot believe that it is in the interests of any of the parties that the current situation should become frozen  still less that it should deteriorate.184.	That conclusion applies overwhelmingly also in southern Africa. Violence cannot be the solution. Human rights must not be trampled upon or ignored. South Africa will not succeed in the end in coercing its neighbours into a change of heart through the use of military force or subversion. Nor  on the other hand  will bomb attacks against innocent people incline the South African Government to change its course.185.	The only hope for a peaceful future in southern Africa lies in political change and the creation of greater trust through regional co operation and international support. We believe these can be achieved and achieved peacefully. The independence agreement for Zimbabwe was an important first step. A settlement in Namibia has still to be reached  but I am confident that  with so many of the difficult issues now settled  it can be reached  and on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). My country is committed to such a settlement and will continue to use its weight and influence to help bring it about  both through our own efforts and in conjunction with the other members of the Western contact group. We have no doubt that the front-line States will be using their influence in the same direction.186.	We do not see or seek to present all the problems and conflicts in the world in terms of East against West. It would be factually wrong to do so wrong also in terms of policy. Problems like those in southern Africa and the Middle East are quite hard enough to deal with as it is. To introduce an element of East-West rivalry  or to add to it where it already exists  could only make things worse. And it is indeed the case that problems are worse where tension is exploited from outside and where international efforts to promote peaceful change are thwarted.187.	In Afghanistan the Soviet Union continues to use military force to suppress a small and non-aligned people. But after nearly four years of brutal military occupation in support of an unpopular and unrepresentative regime  the struggle of the Afghan people for national liberation continues to inspire widespread admiration. Only a complete and prompt Soviet withdrawal can open the way to the return of the Afghan refugees and to the establishment of an independent Government  in accordance with the true wishes of the people and with the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly. 188.	The Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia is another example of a situation in which foreign military force is being used to deny the right to self-determination of a neighbour. We shall continue our full support for the efforts of the United Nations and the neighbouring countries of ASEAN to find a comprehensive political solution based on self-determination.189.	In Central America there is no doubt that many problems stem from social  economic and political injustice. But there is no doubt also that these problems have been and are being exploited by those who seek  not to solve them for the good of the people of those countries  but rather to use them to bring about violent revolution. Our own position is clear. On the one hand we support all efforts to correct injustice by peaceful and democratic means  and we welcome efforts such as those of the Contadora Group to reduce tension and encourage dialogue. On the other hand  we condemn the action of all who use force to block the path to peaceful reform and evolutionary change.190.	The conduct of the Soviet Union in these regional problems has contributed to the present state of strain in East-West relations. The Soviet military build-up  the situation in Poland and the disregard of human rights in the East have also played a part. The brutal destruction of the Korean Air Lines airliner and the murder of its passengers only a few weeks ago were a reminder of how far Soviet international behaviour can fall short of civilized standards. Britain has made plain to the new Soviet leadership that these are matters of grave and continuing international concern to the entire world. But together with our partners we have also saidâand said repeatedly âthat we are ready for a more constructive relationship  provided that the Soviet Union is prepared to adopt a new approach. What we are calling for is willingness by the Soviet Union to base its actions and its policies on respect for internationally accepted standards of behaviour. If the Soviet Union were ready to take real steps in this direction  I have no doubt that the international response would be overwhelming.191.	I have already had occasion to mention human rights when speaking of southern Africa and East-West relations. I could equally have done so in relation to the Middle East  Afghanistan and elsewhere. This year is the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet human rights continue to be widely disregarded in many parts of the world. It is an appealing comment on the failure of the international community to implement the commitments that its Members so readily proclaim.192.	Personal freedom and individual rights are the foundation of national and international order. If they are absent  both national and international edifices  however imposing and monolithic  are a betrayal of those they serve and must ultimately crumble away. Where they are encouraged  international co-operationâand thus international security and prosperityâwill grow on firm foundations. Let each country look honestly at its own performance in this field and resolve to do better. That  rather than speeches  will produce the improvements the people of the world demand.193.	I have ranged widely in my speech and yet left many important subjects untouched. The challenge before us is indeed formidable  but it can be faced successfully if we are prepared to work effectively together. International co-operation is the key: it has worked in Antarctica and it can surely be made to work also nearer hope. We need to think more about our neighbours and to co-operate more with them. We need to take more seriously our international obligations  including respect for individual rights and freedoms and the need to settle problems by peaceful means.194.	Confrontation is easy. Pursuit of national interest appears to be. But neither confrontation nor blind nationalism can provide the conditions of stability essential for peace to break out and the world economy to flourish. That is what our people want  and we owe it to them to make a reality of international co-operation under the Charter. "
"53",2596,"GHA",38,1983,"ï»¿63.	 It is an honour for me  and my very great pleasure  to extend to you  Mr. President  the sincere congratulations of my delegation  as well as those of the Government and people of Ghana  on your election to the high office of the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your long experience in international affairs and diplomacy will ensure that our debates and deliberations throughout this session will come to a fruitful and successful conclusion. It is not just the people of Ghana but also a great number of peoples around the world represented here who hold your country in great respect and admiration. By electing you to the presidency of the General Assembly  therefore  we are paying homage not only to you personally but also to your great country  Panama  with which my country enjoys the most cordial and friendly relations.64.	Your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  also deserves our commendation and congratulations for his high standard of performance and achievement during his term of office at the last session of the Assembly.65.	I must also pay tribute to the Secretary-General who  in the face of mounting odds  has not relented in his efforts and has displayed great courage  foresight and sensitivity in trying to return our troubled world to minimal peace and stability. The Government and people of Ghana are deeply appreciative of his achievements in all fields of endeavour in which the United Nations has been allowed by Member States to play a role or have a say.66.	The Ghana delegation is very pleased to welcome Saint Christopher and Nevis  which became independent only a few weeks ago  into the United Nations family. Saint Christopher and Nevis has played an important role in the social transformation of the Caribbean. On behalf of my Government  I congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on its accession to independence and wish to assure it that Ghana is ready to co-operate with the new State in its effort to achieve the objectives that are common to our two countries.67.	It is indeed disturbing and disappointing that the international political scene has hardly shown any sign of improvement since the last session. Nearly every region of the world is engulfed in war or faces the threat of war. Instead of embracing the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes  we are witnessing a return to the ""might is right"" syndrome. There are unabashed displays of military brinkmanship or gunboat diplomacy where the conference table and dialogue would have assured greater prospects for peace and security.68.	These signs are ominous  as they represent a most serious and depressing deterioration in the international security situation. They are evident everywhereâin Africa  in the Middle East  in Asia and in Central America. In all these areas one war or another is raging. The champions of injustice  oppression  colonialism  exploitation  racial bigotry and imperialism have taken up arms against the forces of progress  human dignity and freedom.69.	On our continent  Africa  the spotlight has again been focused on Chad  where non-African Powers  including a super-Power  have intervened in the internal affairs of that country  thereby robbing the OAU of the opportunity to find a peaceful solution to the long-lasting problem that  unfortunately  is tearing that country apart.70.	For more than 20 years the unfortunate people of Chad  except for brief and uneasy interludes  have seen nothing but fratricidal war and continued destruction of their country  fanned by outside Powers seeking to maintain their so-called spheres of influence. The dramas we are witnessing in Chad and other parts of Africa  and indeed in the other oppressed and brutally treated regions of the world  are a blatant and arrogant manipulation of unsuspecting peoples to serve the national interests of others. The people of Chad are victims of big-Power commitment to the acquisition of spheres of influence.71.	We believe that  if interference from outside forces ceased  this would contribute to the solution of the problem of Chad. Accordingly we address an earnest appeal to all outside Powers to withdraw their forces  advisers and instructors and other manifestations of their presence from Chad. A negotiated solution satisfactory to the different factions in Chad is the only viable policy. In the interest of the suffering people of Chad we call on the warring factions to enter into peaceful negotiations aimed at resolving their differences.72.	Western Sahara is another area which continues to give us great cause for concern. There too we find that foreign super-Power interference has kept the Ores of war burning for several years now  thereby discouraging the pacific settlement of the dispute. We wish  in respect of the situation in Western Sahara  to repeat the OAU's call for an immediate cease-fire and negotiations between Morocco and POLISARIO^ leading to a referendum to be organized under the auspices of the OAU and with the assistance of the United Nations.73.	Elsewhere in Africa  in South Africa and Namibia the majority black population continues to be held captive by the racist regime of	a most brutal  gruesome and oppressive system of colonial and racial subjugation.74.	One of the apartheid regime's most recent exercises in terrorism against the black people of South Africa has been the cold-blooded murder of three valiant and heroic freedom fighters  sentenced to death under the cruel and unjust laws of Pretoria for attempting to advance the cause of freedom  justice and human dignity for their country and people. Impervious to all international appeals for clemency  the racist regime of South Africa callously executed  on 9 June  those valiant African National Congress militants.75.	These and other acts that form part of the South African regime's brutal and repressive tactics are matched only by its hypocrisy and deviousness. The so-called power-sharing arrangement designed to confer limited and largely meaningless political power on the Asian and Coloured populations  while denying the majority black people any participation in the political process  must be seen for what it isâa gigantic political fraud. This is the case also in Namibia  where the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is being undermined by South African intransigence and the injection into the equation of the global strategic interests of a superpower. The linkage of the presence of Cuban troops in Angola to the Namibian problem inevitably delays Namibian independence. While the virtues of the linkage theory are being extolled  military pressures against Angola are being intensified in such a way as to make the presence of Cuban troops in Angola even more necessary. How serious  then  is South Africa in negotiating a settlement of the Namibian problem? Who cannot see that South Africa and its friends would prefer Jonas Savimbi at Luanda to the present regime  whose commitment to true freedom for the Angolans is not compatible with their interests? Who cannot see that a policy of support for Savimbi is a policy in favour of the perpetuation of	and neo colonialism? The theory according to which liberation movements are seen as instruments of communist expansion is very much alive today and it coincides with deepening cold-war rhetoric.76.	For as long as apartheid exists  for as long as Namibian independence is frustrated  so must the liberation struggle continue. Where reason fails force is the answer. We in Ghana are  therefore  pledged to provide ail possible assistance to the freedom fighters of southern Africa until victory is achieved.77.	Anyone can foresee the conflagration to which the southern African situation will give rise if the present conditions persist. We in Ghana are willing  if the situation so demands  to follow the internationalist revolutionary duty of fighting alongside the freedom fighters and those front-line States facing the menace of78.	Perhaps the pursuit of spheres of influence and global strategic interests is an inevitable consequence of the world situation. What we in Ghana refuse to accept as inevitable is the manner in which some of us in Africa aid the realization of these concepts. This is a manifestation of the degree of psychological havoc imperialism wrought on Africa. In Chad  Western Sahara  the Horn of Africa and southern Africa we see the mentality that makes possible the manipulation of our peoples by external forces. Without the likes of Savimbi  Africa would not be such a playground for external Powers. It is not enough to blame imperialism for the woes of Africa. Africans must blame themselves also for allowing imperialism to manipulate them. Our suffering masses deserve better. Independence  which means freedom of choice  must not be allowed to remain a slogan behind which imperialism lurks to mastermind the exploitation of the continent.79.	The tragedy of Africa is even more magnified in the Middle East. While the world is being treated to a treatise on a homeland for the Jews and secure and defensible borders  on an ever-expanding scale  for Israel  the Palestinians are being massacred and scattered. They are denied a homeland or secure borders. The expansionism of Israel is made possible by a steady flow of sophisticated and deadly weapons. Unfortunately  in the face of all this the Arab world remains a theatre of division and intrigue promoted by imperialism. Surely in such a situation the recognition of Palestinian rights will remain a mirage and the hapless people of the region will continue to be victims of circumstances over which they have no control.80.	Ghana will continue to play its modest role through the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon for as long as is necessary in the maintenance of what peace and security is possible in Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East. What we would  however  prefer to see is a serious attempt to effect a comprehensive settlement that would mean peace and security for the people of the region. Such a settlement must take account of the legitimate interests of the Palestinians and of the State of Israel.81.	Elsewhere in the region  we are distressed to find that the destructive armed conflict between Iran and Iraq continues unabated. The continuing war constitutes a profound disappointment for the Non-Aligned Movement  whose solidarity has been sorely tested by the conflict. The mind-boggling cost of this unnecessary war does an injustice to the economic cause of the third world  and we once again appeal to Iraq and Iran to put down their arms and seek a peaceful and negotiated solution to their differences.82.	No less disheartening is the conflict in Afghanistan. There  as elsewhere  the people are victims of superpower rivalry and the theory of global strategic interests. We wish to reaffirm our position that there can be no peace in Afghanistan unless and until all external forces are withdrawn. The people of Afghanistan are entitled to exist without fear of the subversion of their independence or of the violation of their territory. They must be allowed the freedom to organize their society according to their choice. This also goes for Kampuchea.83.	The Central American conflict is emerging as the gravest threat to world peace after the Middle East. The peoples' search for social justice has suddenly been confronted with the strategic interests of outside Powers. A social revolution in EI Salvador is thereby transformed into a hotbed of international conflict and ideological rhetoric. Consequently forces of social progress in Nicaragua and elsewhere in the region have come under extreme and provocative military and economic pressures.84.	The danger exists that the lessons of history may be lost on us. A people's yearning for social justice and independence can never be suppressed. It can be delayed  but it eventually finds expression  often in a more violent form  the longer it is delayed. We can only be dismayed at what the conflict in this region means for the suffering masses. It is our hope that there is a genuine desire on the part of all those involved in this conflict to seek a peaceful settlement that is consistent with the aspirations of the masses for social justice. In this regard it is our hope that the efforts of the Contadora Group to bring all countries in the region to the negotiating table will succeed.85.	The signing of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  in December 1982  marked the beginning of the regulation  in a legitimate manner  of a new international legal regime to govern the uses of oceans. One significant aspect of the Convention is the provision on the concept of the ""common heritage of mankind"". Since the sea  the seabed and the ocean floor all constitute a common heritage of mankind  it is the obligation of members of the international community to come together under the Convention so as to exploit peacefully the resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor for the advantage of all peoples. The concept of the common heritage of mankind offers a chance for reducing rivalry and conflict  and it merits extension to other fields such as outer space. We hope it will commend itself to those who because of their present technological superiority are not inclined to see its value. The world must have learned by now the lessons of a free-for-all policy  whether in the acquisition of colonial territories or spheres of influence  or in the pursuit of material advantage or superiority in the field of armaments.86.	Since the first special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  in 1978  the arms race has continued and intensified. The well-being of the peoples of the world is being sacrificed for the arms race. Statistics show that  in a world full of illiteracy  hunger and malnutrition  squalor and deadly diseases  over 700 000 scientists and engineers are engaged in research and development for military purposes; at least 5 million workers are directly engaged in the production of weapons and other specialized military equipment; global expenditures on military research and development are over $35 billion  or approximately one quarter of all research expenditures; and between 5 and 6 per cent of the total global consumption of petroleum is used for military purposes. Can a world faced with a universal slow-down of socio-economic development and performance afford to continue military expenditure on such a scale?87.	We firmly hold the view that the world would be a better place to live in  and some  if not all  of the present social upheavals would be avoided  if present-day resources for military purposes were released for the constructive cause of human development and progress. The qualitative and quantitative escalation in arms production  especially nuclear arms  has now reached a senseless level which is particularly injurious to the economic interests of developing countries. The Ghana delegation therefore joins in the call on the super-Powers to make a serious effort to reduce their massive military expenditures  eliminate weapons of mass destruction and save the world and mankind from possible destruction.88.	The state of the world economy continues to give cause for grave concern. Most countries of the world  and certainly all developing countries  continue to face serious economic problems that are subverting their very existence. Despite the emerging signs of economic recovery in the United States  and more positive indicators in some other advanced Western economies  there are serious questions about the extent and the durability of the so-called economic upturn or recovery. With the budget deficits of the United States at record levels  and interest rates beginning to rise again  there is a clear possibility that the signs of recovery will be a short-lived phenomenon. If this should happen  then developing countries will have to endure a more protracted period of stagnation and economic deterioration.89.	For developing countries as a group  and for those of Africa in particular  there are hardly any signs of an economic upturn. Indeed  given the peripheral and dependent position assigned to raw material exporters in the world economy  it is hardly surprising that signs of recovery in the advanced economies have yet to be reflected in the developing countries.90.	Countries such as my own continue to suffer a dramatic fall in their export earnings  rapidly deteriorating terms of trade  severe balance-of-payments crises  chronic debt-servicing problems  dwindling access to capital  catastrophic gaps between government revenue and expenditure  and  in many cases  serious declines in local food production. As if this catalogue of woes were not enough  some developing countries  Ghana included  have experienced natural disasters  such as severe drought and forest fires  which have further worsened an already bad situation.91.	Ghana  together with other developing countries  has endeavoured to confront its economic problems with courage and a sense of pragmatism. Far-reaching measures aimed at correcting past mistakes have been taken. Public expenditures have been drastically reduced  exchange rates adjusted  development plans painstakingly scaled down and imports reduced to items essential to national economic survival. These measures have entailed grave political risks for our Government  but in a spirit of realism and resoluteness  they have been implemented. It is therefore with a sense of deep frustration that one listens to the constant refrain from the leaders of the industrialized countries that developing countries must put their economic house in order before their recovery can be assured. The fact of the matter is that in many instances developing countries have carried out  or are in the process of carrying out  all or most of the measures that are feasible in terms of structural adjustments  but their efforts are not being complemented by structural changes in the world economy which only the industrialized countries can make feasible. The continuing insensitivity of the industrialized countries to the equitable demands of the third world is appalling.92.	It is regrettable that the major international conferences of the past year which have focused on economic questions have failed to result in any meaningful steps to improve the dismal situation of non-oil-exporting developing countries. In November 1982  at the ministerial-level meeting of the Contracting Parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  hardly any serious attention was given to the concerns of developing countries. At the Summit of Industrialized Nations  held at Williamsburg by the seven leading Western industrialized States  there was a failure to give the crisis facing developing countries the attention it deserved. This was followed by a disappointing outcome of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade in June 1983. Our hopes for some serious effort at relieving developing countries of their onerous debt problem  for some advances towards the implementation of the Integrated Programme for Commodities  for the finalization of the code of conduct for the transfer of technology  and for a cut-back on protectionism were totally frustrated. To cap it all  there has been a noticeable decrease in lending to developing countries. The least that should be done is to increase the resources of IMF  and Ghana welcomes recent moves in that direction even if they are only a small step in a long journey.93.	Ghana believes that sustained economic recovery in the industrialized countries is not possible unless there is a corresponding improvement in the economies of the third world.94.	We believe there is a massive failure of vision and of political will on the part of the leadership of at least some of the industrialized countries. There is an urgent need for all developing countries to continue and step up diplomatic and political pressure on the industrialized countries for action on the international economic situation.95.	Ghana has been a firm supporter of the role of the United Nations in multilateral economic affairs. We have been supportive because of our perception that the United Nations provides a unique and indispensable global perspective and forum for addressing the complex problems of the global economy. It is therefore with deep misgivings and serious concern that my country watches the gradual erosion of commitment to multilateral forums for solving the problems of the world economy. This dwindling of support is prevalent in the industrialized countries and constitutes a grave threat to the viability and effectiveness of the international system. We therefore join with other developing countries that are members of the Group of 77 in calling upon the industrialized countries not to go back on their obligations and responsibilities as members of the family of nations.96.	In the face of the attitude of the industrialized countries  co-operation among the developing countries takes on a greater significance. Ghana intends to work assiduously with other third world countries not to let this concept remain an empty slogan. Our salvation lies in this.97.	I should like before ending this address to take the opportunity of putting on record Ghana's sincere appreciation for the help and assistance it received from Member States early this year when it was faced with a sudden influx of more than 1 million of its nationals who were obliged to return home from Nigeria. Ghana is also grateful to Member States for subsequently approving resolution 1983/44 at the recent second regular session of the Economic and Social Council  aimed at providing further economic assistance to Ghana for various projects designed to rehabilitate and resettle the returnees  on a more permanent basis. The burden of rehabilitating these returnees  which we fully accept  has proved beyond the capacity of our fragile economy  and we would welcome any assistance to discharge this obligation. We are grateful to Governments  non-governmental organizations and individuals around the world who  in a spirit of charity and human solidarity  responded generously to our appeal for help during the moments of crisis. We hope that they will again assist in completely overcoming this unforeseen human tragedy.98.	I have tried in my brief statement to mirror the concerns and worries which Ghana shares with the rest of the world with regard to the deteriorating economic and political conditions of the world. I wish I could have painted a more hopeful and optimistic picture. None the less  despite this gloomy and foreboding world outlook  it is gratifying to note that the United Nations continues to exist as a forum for resolving conflicts.99.	To avert disaster  the world today requires statesmanship of an unusually high order  and a firm commitment to the peaceful solution of conflicts. We also desperately need  on the part of the leadership in the industrialized countries  a more sophisticated and sympathetic understanding of the interdependence of all countries and national economies. In all this we are confident that the United Nations still provides the best and  indeed  the only hope for solving the problems of mankind.100.	We wish  therefore  to appeal once again to Member States to co-operate in all areas to give the United Nations a chance to work for the peace and security of the world  for the progress and well-being of mankind as a whole  and for the development and welfare of the third world in particular  where most of the conflicts and frustrations of mankind are now concentrated."
"54",2642,"GIN",38,1983,"ï»¿145.	We should like first  Sir  to convey to you  and through you to the people and Government of Panama  the sincere congratulations of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your wealth of experience and your great skill are  as we see it  a firm guarantee that our work will progress harmoniously and successfully.146.	My delegation would like also to express to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  its gratitude for the skill with which he conducted the work of the preceding session of the Assembly.147.	Furthermore  we wish to voice here the gratitude and sincere appreciation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea for the untiring and praiseworthy efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about the peaceful settlement of international problems on the basis of the principles of the United Nations.148.	We take this opportunity to congratulate the fraternal State of Saint Christopher and Nevis on the happy occasion of its admission to the United Nations family.149.	It is particularly disturbing to note that the current session of the General Assembly  like the preceding one  is being held at a time when the international situation is  in many respects  highly worrying. In fact  throughout the worldâin Africa  in Asia and in Latin Americaâhotbeds of tension continue to proliferate and to grow  dangerously imperilling peace and security.150.	This constant exacerbation of the international situation is a direct outcome of the ideological and military confrontation between the two great blocs  which seek to divide the world into zones of influence.151.	As though to make the picture even gloomier  the severe trials imposed by the economic recession  which are especially disastrous for the developing countries  have further thickened an atmosphere already loaded with political tensions.152.	On 29 June 1982  in his statement at the twelfth special session/ our President  Ahmed S6kou Tour^  showed clearly that it is the great Powers with all their military technology which are casting the lures of destruction among the countries which are unaware of the danger hovering over our planet.153.	It is those Powers which foment the local wars they claim are controllable and which thus intentionally maintain a dangerous level of tension in international relations  forcing our countries to neglect their own goals in the struggle against underdevelopment and to devote their attention to a burdensome arms race which jeopardizes the economic  social and cultural progress of our peoples.154.	When we look at the pattern of flash-points in the world  we cannot but note with regret that it is always the same countriesâour countries  the developing countries of Africa  the Middle East  Latin America and Asiaâwhich bear the brunt of this heightening of international tensions.155.	Africa begins the work of the thirty-eighth session with the hope that good sense and morality will induce our Organization to work seriously on the resolution ofhe problems caused by the intolerable policy of apartheid  domination and indignity which prevails in South Africa. Pretoria's challenge to the international community on the question of Namibia  and the armed aggression by South African soldiery against the peoples of Lesotho  Angola  Mozambique and Zimbabwe  are other problems which the United Nations must resolve without delay.156.	That will be possible only if there is an end to the support and criminal complicity of certain nations which  in defiance of the principles of the Charter and even of their own national constitutions  seriously threaten the freedom and dignity of the entire African continent.157.	How is it possible to condemn the policy of apartheid while continuing to provide the South African regime with the means of pursuing it? How is it possible to call for an end to Pretoria's military aggression against neighbouring African States while providing that Fascist regime with the weapons for its adventurist policies? How can one declare that one is in favour of independence for Namibia and at the same time extort guarantees from that State which is not yet independent and also demand from another sovereign State  which is not involved  that it seriously compromise its own security and the survival of its popular and democratic regime?158.	No  our Organization can no longer afford to be the pawn of special interests without damaging its credibility.159.	Today as before  the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea categorically rejects any attempt to link the question of Namibia's independence with the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. That is because our delegation believes that it is essential that the international community finally do everything it can to increase the political  economic and military isolation of the racist minority regime  so as to force Pretoria to accept the full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).160.	Our delegation would like to take this opportunity to express to the freedom fighters of the ANC  the Pan-Africanist Congress and all active forces in South Africa our high appreciation and our whole-hearted solidarity with the courageous struggle which they are waging and the stunning victories they daily achieve. To SWAPO  its revolutionary leadership and its glorious fighters the people of Guinea reaffirm their unconditional support.161.	Again we would pledge to the fraternal front-line countries  that daily suffer the onslaughts of the Fascist regime of Pretoria  our militant solidarity. By their total commitment and their unfailing determination  those States have won the respect and admiration of Africa.162.	The African continent also contains other sources of tension  in the Horn of Africa  in the Sahara and in Chad. Here again  the corrosive effects of international tension and certain special interests have fanned the flames of separatism and have thwarted the efforts of the OAU to find a just and lasting solution.163.	Our delegation remains convinced that  despite all these obstacles  Africa will find the proper solution  enabling the people of the Sahara  through a free referendum supervised by the OAU and the United Nations  to choose their own future and to announce it to the world. Furthermore  the fraternal people of Chad  through patient efforts  will also be able to regain peace and national unity in a sovereign country whose security and territorial integrity will be firmly assured.164.	The Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea  which is a founding member of the OAU  appeals to the international community to give its full support to the OAU in its painstaking efforts to find a peaceful solution to the disputes which are ravaging our continent and seriously impeding the consolidation of its unity and the harmonious and balanced development of the economies of the States of which it is composed.165.	Turning to the problems of the Middle East  our delegation sincerely regrets the constant deterioration of the situation there and the fact that it has been impossible to find any way of putting an end to the bloodshed and the material destruction caused among the civilian population.166.	Israeli aggression in Lebanon has created chaos in that sorely tried country and has made it possible for more Arab land to be occupied  thus widening the gap which separates Israel from its Arab neighbours in the search for a peaceful solution.167.	We would state here with force and conviction that nothing sound  effective or durable can be done by way of resolving the problem of the Middle East without taking into account the Palestinian reality and without recognizing the right of the Palestinian people to found an independent State under the leadership of its vanguard  the PLO.168.	May we reiterate that the people and Government of Guinea harbour no hatred towards the people and Government of Israel. What we cannot tolerate is the language of force and the acquisition of other States' territories by force. History  after all  has taught us that two wrongs do not make a right. We believe that scholars  experts  doctors and agricultural experts in Israel  rather than its armed legions  will make it possible for Israelis and Arabs one day to live in peace and brotherhood  which the whole world hopes will return to that region.169.	In the case of the distressing conflict between Iran and Iraq  the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea is concerned about this for more than one reason. We should like to refer here to the laudable and persevering efforts made by the Islamic Peace Committee  presided over by the head of the State of Guinea  President. That Peace Committee is continuing to do everything it can to bring about a cease-fire  so that there can be peaceful negotiations between these two fraternal Moslem countries which must perforce live in peace.170.	In the Korean peninsula  as in many other parts of Asia  peace is still precarious. The Guinean Government reiterates its appeal to the international community  as well as to all men of goodwill  to support the very sincere efforts being made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to initiate a constructive dialogue between the two communities from the North and South of the Korean nation in order to create a confederate republic. The Korean people  whether they come from the north or from the south  only desire peace and the reunification of their land. The international community must continue its efforts to achieve that objective by securing the withdrawal of all foreign troops and by turning the Armistice Agreement into a peace agreement.171.	The delegation of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea is equally concerned at the situation obtaining in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea. We believe that it is up to the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea themselves freely to determine their domestic and foreign policies without any outside pressure or interference. We also believe that the legitimate status of Prince Norodom Sihanouk should remain one of the components to be borne in mind.172.	As to the crises which beset Latin America and the Caribbean  we favour respect for the territorial integrity and security of all States in that region and non-interference in their domestic affairs. That is why we condemn the transformation of local conflicts into an arena for confrontation between the two main blocs  and support laudable efforts from whatever quarter to bring about a negotiated solution to this regional crisis.173.	In this necessarily incomplete survey of some problems connected with peace and stability in the world  it would only be fair to note that the current session  unfortunately  is taking place against a backdrop of alarming deterioration in the international situation  futures of which are confrontation  military intervention  foreign occupation and the spiralling arms race. The increasingly frequent use or threat of use of force against the sovereignty  political independence and territorial integrity of States since the thirty-seventh session makes even more pertinent the comments made from this rostrum on 29 June 1982 by President Ahmed Sekou Toure. He said:""What actually is threatening peace? It is the practice of colonialism racism and apartheid  hegemonism  the downgrading of the fate of the so-called materially deprived peoples  total scorn for those peoples  the flouting of international laws which guarantee the right of every people to peace  security and progress.""""174.	The deterioration of the international political situation unfortunately seems to be reflected in the sphere of international economic relations  in which the situation gives no grounds for hopeâfar from it.175.	Our intention here is not to single out a scapegoat  much less to identify the guilty  but rather to reiterate our appeal to the international community. The crisis in international economic relations and the growing disparity between the developing countries and the industrialized countries threaten the stability and the independence of our States. The imbalance which has been created and maintained by the wealthy countries is tending to be perpetuated to the detriment of our nations  thus creating an unfair and ill-conceived ready-made situation in which the rich continue to become richer and the poor poorer.176.	In the light of the obstacles placed by the industrialized countries in the way of global negotiations and of the failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade  the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea intends to approach other friendly countries with the aim of bringing about comprehensive and sound co-operation among the developing countries.177.	Naturally  our political approach has always been to give our total support to South-South co-operation  since we regard strengthening unity of action among developing countries  reaffirming their common desire to resolve the various problems inherent in the essential conditions of integrated grass-roots development and establishing open and frank dialogue among them as an essential prerequisite for North-South co-operation on a basis of equality. This political action can be explained by the fact that the industrialized countries are working only for the maintenance and strengthening of their exclusive interests  to the detriment of those of the developing countries  which account for two thirds of the world population.178.	In the face of this situation  which in the long run may well give rise to serious problems that could compromise international peace and security  the developed countries continue to adopt regressive policies and practices that work against the purposes of the new international economic order. We regret to note that official development assistance is actually shrinking in real terms. For all the countries in the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  this assistance represents only approximately 0.37 per cent of the gross national product of the countries concerned  that is  half the target fixed by the United Nations. And this has happened despite the noteworthy efforts which have been made by some Governments.179.	It is therefore time to act because the long-term development of the world economy must necessarily begin with the solution of the economic problems of developing countries in Africa  Latin America and Asia  all of which are potential markets for products from the North.180.	We believe that it is essential for the industrialized countries to devote more resources to development than to the arms race. Similarly  the industrialized nations must apply the relevant General Assembly resolutions relating to development. They should also respond to the appeals made by FAO to implement a world food programme aimed at the stimulation of agricultural production by a massive programme of investment  to strengthen world food security and to liberalize markets so as to guarantee stable and remunerative prices to exporters in developing countries.181.	The difficulties besetting the international economic system unfortunately are not the only ones faced by our countries. Natural disasters are also the daily lot of the developing world. Drought and flood are but two examples.182.	The Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea is looked upon as the watershed of West Africa  since it is the starting-point for a number of international watercourses  and today it is unfortunately suffering the effects of drought. The slopes of the Foutah-Djalon massif have been deforested; therefore a large portion of the country is threatened by desertification. For that reason  the implementation of the project to restore and remodel the Foutah-Djallon massif will undoubtedly have a positive impact economically on the States of West Africa. This project  which is part of the UNEP Plan of Action submitted and supported by the OAU  is a priority project to combat drought in the whole of West Africa. That is why  by granting massive aid for this programme of struggle against desertification in Africa  in accordance with resolution 34/185  the international community would be fulfilling one of the duties imposed by solidarity by assisting in preventive efforts within the framework of our common struggle against natural disaster.183.	To enable the United Nations to achieve its objectives with regard to safeguarding international peace and security  we believe that it is necessaryâindeed  essentialâto adapt its structures and its methods to present-day requirements. Any institution  if it is to be viable and effective  must adapt itself to the requirements of the present day. The United Nations is no exception to this rule.184.	This is why we again make an urgent appeal that the Charter be revised to ensure the equitable representation of all parts of the world in the various deliberative and decision-making bodies. Such a revision would be an effective contribution towards making the United Nations system and international relations more democratic.185.	In this way  we could make the United Nations system more useful  thus permitting it to play a decisive role in the peaceful settlement of conflicts  in the interest of justice and the preservation of international peace and security  leading to genuine  sincere and fruitful cooperation among nations."
"55",2722,"GNB",38,1983,"ï»¿169.	 Before stating at the Assembly the profound concern of my people and my Government at the numerous problems afflicting the present-day world  I should like first of all to express our most heartfelt congratulations to  170.	. Jorge Illueca on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly and to tell him how pleased we are to see him guiding our work. His election is  in fact  a well earned tribute to his outstanding qualities as a statesman and to his personal qualifications as a fervent defender of the ideals of peace and understanding among nations  and also a tribute to his country  the Republic of Panama  with which the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  of course  has the best relations of friendship and co-operation. My delegation is convinced that under his presidency and thanks to his great competence and his profound knowledge of the fundamental issues of international life  the work of this session will fully respond to the aspirations of our peoples by making an appreciable contribution to the analysis of the principal world problems discussed here and to the maintenance of international peace and security. It is a great honour for me on this occasion to express to his predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  our deep appreciation for the tireless efforts  the dedication and the great skill that he placed at the service of the United Nations and of its aims throughout his term of office.171.	We also convey our most sincere gratitude and admiration to the Secretary-General for his constant dedication to the search for satisfactory solutions to the many problems  conflicts and tensions that unceasingly threaten the world with the danger of a new irremediable deterioration of the international situation that could have terrible consequences. Since this is the first time that I have the honour of speaking before the Assembly  I am all the more pleased to take this opportunity to congratulate him and to tell him how much my country appreciates his objective and lucid report on the work of the United Nations [ 4/33/V].172.	I should like  in this respect  to reiterate here the complete readiness of the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to work towards the complete realization of the goals that have been established  the measures proposed and the solutions envisaged in our work for world peace  development  the establishment of harmonious relations of friendship and co-operation among nations  and the constant strengthening of the United Nations role and its capacity for action.173.	The present deplorable international situation  which challenges the most precious moral and legal values of human civilization and shakes its very foundations  requires from all a measure of understanding  effort and goodwill  without which the structural and objective reordering of its co-ordinates will be merely a Utopian dream.174.	These facts confirm more than ever before the urgent need for joint and resolute action on the part of the great family of nations  aimed at establishing a true era of change and a struggle for the attainment of a world of progress and justice.175.	The constant expansion of the membership of this family since the birth of the Organization is tangible proof of the irreversible nature of the process of growing awareness on the part of the peoples of their inalienable rights and of the need for them to participate fully in international affairs.176.	That is why my Government is deeply pleased to welcome the admission of Saint Christopher and Nevis as a full-fledged Member of our Organization. We wish it every success in the building of a new State and in the promotion of social and economic development.177.	We are particularly pleased that the admission of that new Member coincides with the celebration by our people and its guiding political organization  the PAIGC of the tenth anniversary of the proclamation of the independent State of Guinea-Bissau. 178.	The problems besetting the present world and the ills that endanger its development prospects are many and  we fear  are becoming increasingly complex. The reactivation of the cold war  the resurgence of the arms race  of arbitrary conduct and of contempt for the most basic rules of international law and of the principles that govern relations among States  and the general deterioration of the world economy are all  in fact  of unprecedented significance today. With that dramatic picture as a backdrop  we see our own responsibilities increased. That is especially true since our people still expect us to take specific action in pursuit of the aims enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.179.	In spite of the historic strengthening of the interdependence of peoples and economies  we see a striking accentuation of the basic contradiction of our day  that is  the inexorable widening of the economic gap between nations and the increasingly marked division of the world into rich regions and countries  on the one hand  and poor and needy regions and countries on the other. The disquieting decline of the per capita gross domestic product in a large number of developing countries  the alarming deficit in their balance of payments and the burden of their foreign debt are among the particularly serious consequences of the crisis in the existing world economic system.180.	In such a situation  the inadequacy of the measures currently proposed unfortunately make it unlikely that there will be a recovery of the world economy  in the long term or the short term  or that we shall be able to achieve the goals of the new international economic order and the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. However  we have ample reason to promote positive and beneficial interdependence for all as it is clear that progress in the developing countries will contribute to a recovery of the world economy and to the progressive elimination of the structural imbalances that characterize it today.181.	No member of the international community  regardless of its economic potential  can remain indifferent to the stagnation of the volume of international trade  unparalleled since the Second World War  or to the recession  which is more extensive and damaging than the great depression of the 1930s.182.	The development plans and the economic recovery programmes of the developing countries designed to deal with the steady deterioration of their economies cannot have the desired stabilizing effects without the appropriate support of the international community at large and without appropriate action through the existing instruments and machinery for co-operation and development aid.183.	The Republic of Guinea-Bissau has not been spared the harmful effects of the present world economic situation  whose burdens compound the burdensome heritage of colonial domination and the climatic vicissitudes of the Sudano-Sahelian region to which it belongs. Realizing the need to respond to that situation with a coherent strategy  my country is now working to attain the objectives of its first four-year development plan and its programme for economic and financial stabilization.184.	Those objectives and the measures adopted with a view to their implementation are known to all our economic partners. We take this opportunity to reiterate our Government's invitation to them to participate in the conference of donor countries which will be held at the beginning of 1984.185.	The situation of the least developed countries  of which the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is one  has in no way improved in recent years. For some  the situation has steadily deteriorated.186.	The need to deal with conditions of extreme poverty and to guarantee that the basic needs of the populations of those countries are met  on the one hand  and the search for a solution to economic and financial problems  on the other  are facing those countries with an unprecedented dilemma.187.	The acute crisis in multilateral co-operation today  the adoption of purely temporary and partial measures  the protectionist barriers imposed by certain developed countries on imports from the developing countries  the constant deterioration of the terms of trade and the plunge of commodity prices  the uncertainty of food supplies  the marked decline in preferential development aid âto mention but a few of the most important factorsâ all constitute obstacles to the remedying of the already desperate situation of those countries.188.	With the adoption by the General Assembly of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  as well as resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) concerning the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  new development prospects appeared which seemed to promise a better future.189.	It is none the less regrettable to have to note today the meagre progress achieved in the implementation of these resolutions. The global negotiations outlined in resolution 34/138  which still constitute one of the international community's most important initiatives in the field of multilateral economic co-operation  remain on our agenda. As was fittingly stressed at the seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held last March at New Delhi  those negotiations would undoubtedly give a new impetus to multilateral co-operation in the principal sectors of the world economy and would promote the implementation of measures adopted within the framework of the International Development Strategy.190.	It is also regrettable that the excellent opportunity offered by the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was not seized to give the North-South dialogue the momentum it needs for the adoption of measures which could meet the requirements of development and of overcoming the present world economic crisis.191.	By adopting the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  the international community took a decisive step towards harmonizing the shared aspirations of mankind to peace and co-operation. We join other Members of this Organization in appealing to all countries to sign and promptly ratify that important instrument.192.	The danger of nuclear war  the unprecedented proliferation of nuclear weapons and the squandering of vast human  material  financial and technical resources on an unproductive and wasteful arms race make it urgent that we adopt measures to give momentum to the at present deadlocked process of achieving general and complete disarmament under effective international control.193.	To that end we encourage the replacement of negative and hasty attitudes by a constructive approach to disarmament questions  thus making it possible to consider objectively the various proposals made in this sphere with the primary objective of safeguarding international peace and security.194.	Another important disarmament measure is the creation of zones of peace in various parts of the world on the basis of arrangements freely reached among the States of the regions concerned. In this connection we welcome the international community's initiatives aimed at the demilitarization and denuclearization of regions such as the Indian Ocean  the Mediterranean and the African continent.195.	From this rostrum we echo the voices of peoples thirsting for freedom  peace and justice in condemning most forcefully the injustices that prevail in international relations and the forces that continue to oppose the elimination of relations based on inequality  domination  exploitation and racial discrimination.196.	In the Middle East  the Palestinian people continues to confront Israel's shameful violation of its legitimate and inalienable right to a dignified and prosperous life. The Zionist regime of Israel is seeking by all possible means to affirm and consolidate its presence in the occupied Arab territories. Since the annexation of the Golan Heights  the West Bank of the Jordan and the City of Jerusalem  Israel has been manoeuvring ceaselessly to impose its civil administration in the occupied territories and to change the political  cultural  religious  demographic and geographical characteristics of those territories.197.	The Palestinian people and its sole legitimate representative  the PLO  have countered these aggressive acts with an unshakable determination to develop their just fight to safeguard their national interests and recover the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence and to establish its own independent sovereign State on its national territory  in conformity with the resolutions of the General Assembly.198.	In addition  acts of aggression  destabilization and provocation are directed daily against the sovereign people of Lebanon. Israel tramples on  and thus challenges  the fundamental rules and values forged by human civilization  as well as the independence  security and territorial integrity of that Arab country.199.	By deliberately attacking the Iraqi nuclear installations  Israel not only demonstrated its utter disdain for the sovereignty of other peoples  but also clearly violated established international rules regarding  apartheid international peace and security and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.200.	In southern Africa the forces of progress continue to confront apartheid  racial discrimination and the persistence of the colonial tyranny promoted by the racist regime of South Africa.201.	The untenable situation caused by Pretoria's policy of oppression against the Namibian people and by its continued acts of aggression and destabilization against the independent front-line Statesâespecially Angola  Mozambique and  most recently  Lesothoâconstitute a serious threat to peace and security in the region.202.	The delaying tactics aimed at setting the stage for continued colonial domination of that African territory  Namibia and  in particular  the absurd thesis making the independence of Namibia dependent on the withdrawal of Cuban international forces from Angola  can at most result in the postponement of the liberation of the Territory  which is the inevitable outcome of the legitimate struggle of its people.203.	The allegedly constitutional and political plans within the framework of the concept of a so-called internal settlement  advocated by South Africa with the aim of consolidating the illegal occupation of Namibia and the plundering of its natural wealth by foreign interests  constitute an intolerable violation of the provisions of theCharter and reflect the brazenness and arrogance of the regime.204.	The sole valid basis for a peaceful and final settlement of the question of Namibia remains Security Council resolution 435 (1978). That is why we appeal earnestly to the various United Nations organs  the Security Council in particular  and to all Member countries  as well as to international organizations which are not within the United Nations system  to spare no effort to ensure the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia.205.	For its part  the people of South Africa  under the leadership of the African National Congress  is facing with heroism and self-sacrifice the infamous and systematic acts of oppression  discrimination and division directed at the overwhelming majority of the South African population.206.	The question of Namibia and the wave of instability and violence which is engulfing the southern part of the African continent are closely related to the inhuman nature and policy of the Pretoria regime  which constitute the nucleus and the profound cause of the intolerable political situation prevailing in that region. The people of Guinea-Bissau reiterates its fraternal  constant and unconditional support for the just causes of the Namibian and South African peoples  as well as for the firm determination of the front-line States to defend their independence and their national sovereignty  particularly the People's Republic of Angola  which has been obliged to bear the heavy burden of the harmful policies of the South African regime  as a result of the unconditional support that Angola provides to the national liberation struggle led by SWAPO.207.	In view of the particularly difficult hardships endured by the Angolan people as a result of the occupation of the southern part of its national territory by South African forces and in view of the escalation of aggression and the destabilization manoeuvres perpetrated by the apartheid regime  we strongly urge the international community to respond by means of concrete support and effective moral and material assistance to the Angolan people's appeals for solidarity.208.	The struggle of the people of Western Sahara for the exercise of its right to self-determination  which has found its highest expression in the proclamation of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic  deserves our complete support. The nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held in the capital of Ethiopia last June  made it possible to move forward along the path of dialogue with a view to arriving at a just  peaceful and definitive solution to that thorny problem which threatens the peace and security of north-west Africa. Therefore we urgently appeal to the parties to the dispute  the Kingdom of Morocco and POLISARIO   to work in a spirit of good will and peace towards the strict implementation of the resolution adopted by the Assembly on the Western Sahara .209.	The tragic situation prevailing in Chad and the sad fate of the people of that African country  which has been the victim for more than two decades of internecine struggle aggravated by incessant foreign interference and intervention  are a source of profound concern to us. The final elimination of the tension  divisions and instability that afflict that country can be attained only through strict respect for its national independence and its territorial integrity. We encourage the starting of immediate and constructive negotiations between the parties concerned with a view to the peaceful solution to the internal differences so as to arrive at the effective and immediate cessation of ail hostilities and the prompt withdrawal of all foreign forces from Chad  thus ensuring the establishment of a lasting peace there and the economic reconstruction of the country.210.	We sincerely hope to see the final settlement of the territorial questions still outstanding  in particular the Comorian island of Mayotte  the Glorieuses  Juan de Nova  Europe and Bassas da India islands  belonging to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar and the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia  which is under the sovereignty of Mauritius.211.	We also express our constant and fraternal solidarity with the struggle of the brotherly people of East Timor  under the leadership of FRETILIN   for the recovery of its national rights and its liberation from Indonesian oppression and repression. In this regard  my delegation supports the proposal by the Secretary-General  approved by the General Assembly  for the inscription of the question of East Timor on the agenda of the next session.212.	Furthermore  we support the legitimate efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to reunify the Korean homeland peacefully and without foreign interference.213.	The disquieting situation prevailing in South-East and South-West Asia is brought with serious consequences for peace and stability in those regions. In our view  this situation can be reversed only by global political solutions based on dialogue and negotiations with the participation of all the parties concerned and on respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of all the States of the region and their right to determine their own destiny.214.	The conflict between Iran and Iraq continues to be a source of profound concern for the international community. The gravity of its implications for the two parties and for the region confirms the wisdom of the principle of the Charter concerning the inadmissibility of the settlement of international disputes by the use of force. The higher interests of the fraternal peoples of those two members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference require that that fratricidal conflict be brought to an end and that measures be taken for a rapid negotiated settlement of the question.215.	While welcoming the intensification of the efforts made by the Secretary-General and the continuation of the intercommunal dialogue in the Republic of Cyprus  we cannot fail to express our concern at the occupation of part of the territory of that independent State. We hope that a just and final solution will at last be found to that problem in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the Non-Aligned Movement  safeguarding the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity  unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus and promoting the return of Cypriot refugees.216.	The international community cannot remain indifferent to the continued tension prevailing in Latin America and in the Caribbean. The serious political  economic and social crisis in the countries of those regions  due in part to the existence of traditional structures  repressive regimes and inadequate economic structures that lead to poverty and favour social inequality  is incessantly aggravated by interference and intervention from outside.217.	In such a situation it is essential for those States to be enabled in all independence to resolve their internal problems and work towards the establishment of conditions conducive to peace  development and the well-being of their respective populations and that of the region at large. In this regard  we reiterate our firm solidarity with the struggle of the peoples of the region aimed at the construction of democratic and progressive societies  and we support the efforts made  particularly by Cuba and Nicaragua  to safeguard the accomplishments of their revolutions  their national independence and their right to free economic and social development.218.	Furthermore  Guinea-Bissau expresses its support for the action of the Contadora Group countries in promoting a political  comprehensive and lasting solution to the problems confronting the peoples of that region.219.	Our debates reflect the general concern of the members of the international community at the world situation which is today more complex than in the past and which requires renewed efforts on the part of all in order to retrace its dismal co-ordinates.220.	As we do every year  we are dealing with the most delicate problems of international life and  as in every year  differences of opinion will appear in the analysis of these problemsâdifferences which will in turn be reflected m the nature of solutions proposed.221.	This  however  in no way prevents us from being each time more optimistic as to the final outcome of our efforts to build a world free of threats  conflicts  poverty and insecurity.222.	To that end  the contribution we each make and the political will with which we implement our resolutions will be decisive  regardless of the respective economic or military might of each of our countries.223.	On behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  I wish to convey to the President our wish for the success of the thirty-eighth session and reiterate to him our firm resolve to make  together with the other members of the international community  untiring efforts to attain the objectives of peace  justice and social progress so dear to mankind."
"56",2761,"GNQ",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 It is a great pleasure for me to address the Assembly at its yearly meeting  this time at its thirty-eighth session. It is our deep hope that the work of this session will be successful so that reason and justice may prevail over selfish and hegemonic designs which today serve only to threaten the existence of the human race. My delegation's presence in New York is eloquent proof of our conviction that within the United Nations we could find the unity of nations  even in diversity. We could negotiate together the solution of problems and differences  though with different procedures; we could bring peoples closer together in spite of geographical distances  if we were all to resolve to do so. Only in this way  we believe  will we be able to ensure the socio-economic and cultural well-being to which each and every one of the inhabitants of our world aspires.2.	With this outlook  it is a particular pleasure for me to convey to the representatives gathered here the greetings and wishes for success of Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  who since his accession to the highest office of our nation has placed the greatest emphasis on the importance and raison dâÃªtre of the United Nations  particularly now  when dialogue becomes increasingly difficult because those taking part are speaking at cross purposes and when the use of force becomes increasingly imminent because of the juxtaposition of interests.3.	Mr. President  I do not wish to enter into the substance of my statement without first of all saying how delighted my country and my delegation are at your well- deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session. Although we are aware that because of the nature and volume of the items on the agenda and because of the present international situation your task will not be an easy one  we are none the less convinced that the ideals of freedom  peace and justice that characterize Panama  your country  and your own skills as a diplomat and statesman are a guarantee of the success of our work. The election of the other members of the General Committee is for us a source of pride and a sign of hope. To each and every one  we address our most sincere congratulations.4.	At the same time  we express our sincere appreciation and congratulations to Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  as well as to each member of the General Committee at the thirty-seventh session  for the efficiency and dynamism with which they conducted the work of that session.$175.	For the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  which is celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of its independence today  and for the United Nations and all its Members  the past year  September 1982 to September 1983  has recorded both encouraging and discouraging developments in the annals of history.6.	One of the favourable developments is that the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  committed to its objectives and loyal to its principles  has put into operation a democratizing machinery  with the establishment  through the unanimous approval of our basic law in a popular referendum  of the three powers- executive  judicial and legislativeâthat are now governing our country.7.	We know full well  however  that the mere availability of constitutional instruments and organs does not mean the effective and coherent functioning of those organs  much less the institutionalization of the democracy which protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of the human being  which should be aimed at the achievement of his full development. Nevertheless  we are convinced that the United Nations as a whole and all countries that cherish freedom  justice and peace individually will continue to make their valuable contribution to the attainment of those objectives to which the people of Equatorial Guinea aspires.8.	Please allow me to take this opportunity to express the thanks of Equatorial Guinea for the multisectoral and multifaceted assistance given thus far by friendly countries and by the United Nations system in our process of national recovery. At the same time  we hope that the assistance pledged for the economic recovery and development of cur country will be received in the near future  and we also hope that there will be an increase in the list of potential donors and in the contributions themselves.9.	In the context of international co-operation  Equatorial Guinea supports and encourages the establishment of economic and technical co-operation among the developing countries in the framework of South-South negotiations. But this in no way reduces our interest in the resumption and progress of the North-South negotiations. It is in this spirit that  in the central African subregion  my Government is currently engaged in negotiations to bring Equatorial Guinea into the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa and the financial institutions of that subregion. An agreement in principle on membership was reached in the Council of Heads of State of the Union  which met at Yaounde in December 1982. The technical negotiations are now at an advanced stage  and we hope that our final admission will take place in the near future. This will be our own modest contribution to the realization of the declaration adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its extraordinary session devoted to economic problems which was held at Lagos in 1980.10.	As I have stressed  this wish of ours to participate in regional and subregional efforts for the economic reconstruction of the African continent does not imply any obstruction of or opposition to bilateral and multilateral co-operation  which my Government encourages without distinction of political  economic or ideological systems. 11.	In that connection  apart from developing our relations with neighbouring countries  those of our region and Africa at large  we attach particular importance to our co-operation with the countries of Europe  Asia  the Middle East and Latin America and the Caribbean  particularly with those of the Hispanic American group  in order to preserve and develop the existing ties between our peoples. On this basis we have worked and shall continue to work to maintain close and constant co-operation based on the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and on the principles of the Movement of Non Aligned Countries  with a view to promoting mutual advantage  defined as co-operation among States  not subject to the circumstances of domestic political change.12.	In this connection  I to take this opportunity to make it clear that certain interests adverse to my country have in the course of this year embarked on a venomous campaign contrary to the true state of affairs in order to harm Equatorial Guinea's relations  especially those we maintain with Spain  a country with which we co-operate even to a greater extent than is called for in the agreements that have been signed between the two countries.13.	As I have already indicated  the recent past has not been altogether filled with joy and optimism  because the political and economic imbalances currently characterizing international relations and the deadlock in the negotiations to correct the inequalities and imbalances have harmful effects in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.14.	One of the consequences of our faith in the United Nations is our constant need to express on every occasion our adherence to the principles and purposes of the Charter  as well as those of the Non-Aligned Movement  such as respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of countries  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  the peaceful solution of conflicts  the maintenance of good-neighbourly relations  the use of dialogue rather than force in the search for solutions to the differences that may arise between States and the promotion of relations of interdependence. These pillars are the be-all and end-all of the foreign policy of the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  presided over by Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.15.	With regard to attaining these ideals  which constitute the prerequisites for the establishment of freedom  peace and justice in the world  the Republic of Equatorial Guinea notes with concern the deterioration of the international situation  which is now characterized by an unbridled arms race  fratricidal wars in the four comers of the world and the imposition by force of economic or ideological systems that do not correspond to the requirements of the populations concerned.16.	Therefore Equatorial Guinea  not wishing to be a spectator before these errors of mankind  has joined in the efforts of the international community to establish a new international economic and human order. This involves  among other things  curbing the arms race  with a consequent decrease in military budgets; adopting preventive measures against international terrorism  which is claiming too many lives; and eradicating the system of recruiting  using  financing and training mercenariesâ which are all factors destabilizing the political and economic order of independent countries.17.	Today the international community watches indifferently as innocent men  women  children and elderly persons become the targets of ideological  military and hegemonistic rivalry. Yesterday it was the Palestinians and the Mack South Africans; today it is 269 persons travelling on a South Korean commercial airliner. In view of this further evidence of disregard for the human person  Equatorial Guinea cannot conceal its concern &t such occurrences and appeals to the international community and to the General Assembly to adopt specific resolutions making it possible for international organizations and Governments to take coherent measures to avoid similar acts in the future.18.	A few days ago we welcomed with great happiness the admission to the United Nations family of a new State  Saint Christopher and Nevis. As we congratulate that fraternal people on its attainment of independence and its admission to our ranks  Equatorial Guinea wishes to remind the international community gathered here that the historic resolution 1514 (XV)  adopted by the General Assembly at its fifteenth session  has not yet been fully implemented.19.	Namibia remains illegally occupied by the racist regime of South Africa  which  with the complicity of certain Powers  turns an increasingly deaf ear to the reproof and condemnation of the international community  which cherishes peace  justice and freedom. We regard as inappropriate the linking of the independence of Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola  as that linkage would contradict the Charter and the norms of international law. Since its cause is just  Namibia must exercise its right to self-determination and independence.20.	In South Africa the system of apartheid continues to be an insult to human dignity and a challenge to world public opinion. It is inconceivable and at the same time striking that the creator of a system such as apartheid should become increasingly arrogant and intransigent in spite of the fact that this system has been condemned by almost all the States Members of the United Nations. That arrogance and intransigence have not been confined to increasing the repression of the black South African majority and strengthening the illegal occupation of Namibian territory  but have extended to acts of military aggression and other destabilizing practices against Angola  Botswana  Lesotho  Mozambique  Zambia and Zimbabwe  with consequent loss of human life and property.21.	In this connection  while Equatorial Guinea is in complete agreement with the need for material  political and diplomatic aid to be given to those countries for the safeguarding of their independence and territorial integrity  at the same time we believe that the eradication of the cause is the fundamental issue. To abolish the apartheid system in South Africa would be to bring justice to that part of the African continent.22.	Equatorial Guinea takes an optimistic view with regard to the statements made by King Hassan II of Morocco concerning the resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its sessions at Nairobi and Addis Ababa for a negotiated solution of the question of Western Sahara. We believe that the cessation of hostilities and the holding of a free and properly organized referendum under the supervision of the Organization of African Unity  and the United Nations  through which the people of Western Sahara would be able to pronounce itself clearly on its own destiny  constitutes the best way to a just and lasting solution to this conflict which for so long has claimed so many innocent lives.23.	The terrible tragedy that the fraternal people of Chad have experienced for many years requires that the international community assist and co-operate so that the people of Chad themselves can through reconciliation arrive at genuine peace in their country. The internationalization of that conflict which tends to impose a settlement of that interminable war by force of arms would only prolong it. In this connection  we support the proposal that all foreign forces withdraw from Chad and  at the same time  the parties to the dispute peacefully resolve their differences through dialogue.24.	We express our support for and solidarity with the Argentine Republic in its struggle to recover its national sovereignty. We deeply regret the loss of human life and material goods caused by the conflict over the Malvinas  but we are none the less convinced that reason and justice will make it possible for Argentina to recover the part of its territory which it claims.25.	The historic relations and cultural affinity that bind the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and the Latin American countries justify our concern at the prevailing situation in Central America. We appeal to all the parties involved in that tragedy  which is costing innocent human lives and considerable material losses  to engage in dialogue in order to find solutions to their differences  with strict respect for the free will of each people in the exercise of its right to choose the political and economic system most in tune with its national interests.26.	It is regrettable that Latin America  which had been identified on the international scene as a labourer in the struggle against underdevelopment  is today the target of fratricidal struggles and the scene of political and hegemonic confrontations which merely serve alien interests. It is for this and other reasons that Equatorial Guinea supports and is at one with the initiatives taken by the Contadora Group. That is why we support the other peace initiatives being put forward by the countries of the region  directly or indirectly concerned. All of these efforts are aimed solely at ensuring the return of peace and stability for the progress of that region.27.	In the Middle East  certain Arab territories have been occupied by Israel for more than a decade now  and the Palestinians remain without a homeland and are scattered throughout the world. At the same time  the positions of the parties involved in that complex dispute grow further and further apart. The sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon are increasingly stifled  while innocent lives are lost and hunger and poverty are the daily lot of that part of the world.28.	We appeal to the Arab and Israeli Governments and to the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLC] for peace and reconciliation  to reconsider their antagonistic positions and sit down to negotiate together in order to find the most appropriate ways of returning peace  harmonious co-existence and stability to the Arab and Israeli peoples  who are doomed to live for ever in that afflicted region of the Middle East. We hope that third-party countries directly or indirectly involved in the conflict will contribute towards the achievement of that goal.29.	It is regrettable to note that at the very time when the world is waging a war against hunger  illness and povertyâin a word  against underdevelopmentânew hotbeds of tension are being created and existing ones are being exacerbated. In this context  in a region of strategic importance  both politically and economically  there has been loss of human lives and considerable material damage. I am referring to the conflict between Iran and Iraq  brother countries to which we urgently appeal that they cease hostilities and solve the problem in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement and international law.30.	In South-East Asia and South-West Asia the search continues for peace and liability in Kampuchea and Afghanistan. We believe that it is the inhabitants of those countries first and foremost who must seek comprehensive solutions to their internal problems through peaceful negotiations  since the intervention of third countries not resulting from the free expression of the will of the indigenous inhabitants must be condemned as contrary to the Charter. It is the right of every people to decide its own form of government and to choose the economic  political and social system that suits it best  without external pressure or force.31.	Similarly  the Korean peninsula remains artificially divided in spite of the firm desire for reunification constantly expressed by the Korean people in both North and South and endorsed by both Governments in a joint statement issued on 4 July 1972.' On the basis of that joint statement  we once again call upon the Governments of the two Koreas to establish conditions conducive to the resumption of negotiations  which we ho  will be concluded to the satisfaction of the Korean people as a whole.32.	The independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus continue to be threatened and cannot be strengthened because of the occupation of part of that country by foreign troops. We appeal for the withdrawal of those troops and ask the Cypriot communities to resolve their internal problems through peaceful negotiations and to create conditions conducive to the return of the Cypriot refugees  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council.33.	For a very long time now mankind has been engaged in a constant battle against its worst enemies: hunger  disease and poverty. It is therefore inconceivable that  while success in that battle is still uncertain  mankind itself should be preparing with all haste for its own destruction. The proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increase of military bases  allegedly for reasons of security and protection  lead only to the victory of hunger  disease and poverty over the human being. We hope that statements on disarmament  the creation of zones of peace in various regions  the prevention of nuclear war and the reduction of military budgets will be matched by deeds. Only in that way will mankind be protected and feel secure.34.	The lack of democracy in international relations not only constitutes a failure in the political relations among States but is also the cause of the unprecedented economic crisis of the world today  which is characterized by the stagnation of and decline in economic activity  an unending and growing deficit in the balance of payments of the developing countries  a steady increase in their external debt  low prices for raw materials and the corresponding enrichment of the more developed countries.35.	These and many other irregularities have shown that the existing international economic order is inadequate and cannot respond to present-day requirements. Hence  the need to begin a process of global negotiations making possible the establishment of a new international economic order based on justice and equity  and not aimed at the enrichment of the rich and the impoverishment of the poor.36.	Although we regret the intransigence of the developed countries  which continues to be an obstacle to the progress of the North-South negotiations  we are convinced that the economic recovery of the North is closely related to the economic survival of the South. That is why we hope that the political will of all will contribute to the democratization of international economic relations.37.	The Non-Aligned Movement has always felt the need to begin an era of prosperity for all. This is why the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983  laid the groundwork for the recovery and restructuring of the world economy.38.	I would be remiss in my duty if I were to conclude my statement without conveying the feelings of gratitude and appreciation of Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  his Government and the people of Equatorial Guinea to the Secretary-General for his constant efforts to safeguard the principles and attain the objectives of the Charter. We greatly value the contribution which the United Nations unceasingly makes in the task of the national reconstruction of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.39.	May the United Nations remain the forum for peace negotiations and not a stage for confrontation     "
"57",2806,"GRC",38,1983,"ï»¿135.	Mr. President  I have the honour of addressing the General Assembly on behalf of the European Community and its 10 member States. It is with particular pleasure that I congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the Assembly. For many years you have distinguished yourself at the service of both your country and the international community  thus earning general esteem and respect. I am sure that you will carry out your duties with efficiency  objectivity and dexterity  thus contributing to the success of an Assembly which meets at a critical juncture. I take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the European Community to the outgoing President  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the great skill with which he has guided the deliberations of this body over the past 12 months.136.	We also wish to commend the Secretary-General for his intellectual and moral probity  the high concept he has of his mission and his dedication to peace and to the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.137.	Finally  let me extend our warmest congratulations to the new Member of the Organization  Saint Christopher and Nevis.138.	The European Community was born of the desire of several States  cherishing the same democratic values  to base their relationship on new forms of solidarity  in order to face challenges which would have been difficult to take up in isolation. This is why the 10 countries for which I speak today are fully committed to respect for the Charter and view the United Nations as a vehicle for creating a better and safer world. Through regular consultation on international problems and constant efforts to define a common policy  the 10 countries  as individual States and as a Community  intend to continue to strengthen their co-operation with the United Nations and the Secretary-General.139.	At the thirty-seventh session  speaking from this rostrum on behalf of the Community  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark painted the situation prevailing in the world in somber colors. At the start of the thirty-eighth session it must be admitted that this assessment unfortunately remains valid.140.	How  it might be asked  could the situation basically improve as long as Member States continue to violate the most fundamental principles of the Charter and to ignore the repeated appeals addressed to them by the Organization to refrain from the use or threat of use of force and to put an immediate end to the conflict in which they are engaged? It should not come as a surprise  therefore  that none of the old conflicts has been resolved and that ominous signs of new tensions are looming on the horizon.141.	Relations between East and West have been gravely affected these past years by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the situation in Poland  as well as by the continued Soviet military buildup. A further cause of aggravation has been the shooting down of the Korean airliner by a Soviet fighter. The European Community deeply deplores this act  which resulted in the loss of many innocent human lives. The 10 members have asked that the appropriate international organs undertake a thorough investigation of the circumstances of the incident. They welcome the decisions of the ICAO Council adopted at Montreal on 16 September. They support the proposals submitted to ICAO for ensuring greater safety of civilian aircraft in future  including the prohibition of the use of armed force.142.	Our countries  peoples and Governments are ready to improve relations with the Soviet Union and its allies  provided they abide by internationally accepted standards of behaviour  so that international confidence can be restored. Only then could there be a better understanding among the European peoples and an atmosphere conducive to the consolidation of peace and stability on our continent.143.	It is in this light that we have viewed and continue to view the situation in Poland. The Community has taken note of the measures adopted by the Polish Government on 22 July 1983  some of which go in the right direction while others provide the authorities with the legal means to suppress possible dissident activities more effectively. In a spirit of friendship towards the Polish L people  the Community hopes that these steps will be followed by further measures leading to reconciliation  dialogue and reform  in accordance with the aspirations. of all the national and social elements of the population.144.	The successful conclusion of the negotiations at Madrid of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a cause of satisfaction to the members of the European Community. Our approach at the Conference was guided by the endeavour to promote respect for the Helsinki Final Act to ensure its full implementation and to pursue the aims of the Conference process through dialogue and co-operation. The presence of all our foreign ministers at Madrid bore testimony to this commitment although the Concluding Document does not represent he maximum that could have been achieved  it was substantial and balanced. We attach as great an importance to the human dimension of that document as to its provisions concerning the convening of a conference on disarmament in Europe.145.	That brings me to the wider issue of disarmament. It is an issue of the utmost importance to the Community and of increasing public opinion  since it affects the survival of mankind. It is also a very complex problem. Expenditure has shown how difficult it is to achieve disarmament in an atmosphere of distrust  fear and prejudice. To preserve peace it is necessary not only to reduce armaments but to remove the causes of conflict as well.146.	This applies as much to Europe as to other parts of the world. The 10 countries of the European Community are making every effort to reduce the level of military forces in Europe while maintaining undiminished security for all States. Hence the importance they attach to the full range of ongoing or scheduled negotiations  particularly the talks between the United States and the Soviet Union at Geneva on strategic and intermediate nuclear forces. Given the size of the nuclear arsenal of these two countries  it is generally recognized that progress on nuclear disarmament is closely related to their agreeing on substantial and verifiable reductions.147.	The European Community  therefore  gives full support to both the strategic arms reduction talks and the intermediate nuclear forces negotiations. It is our sincere wish that it will prove possible for the two major nuclear Powers to come to an agreement in the near future. The objective of such an agreement should be to strike a balance at the lowest possible level.148.	While nuclear arms control negotiations are taking place in order to halt the vertical proliferation  the maintenance and strengthening of the present non-proliferation regime  which so far has been successful in halting the further spread of nuclear weapons  is a very significant element in the disarmament equation.149.	However  we should not lose sight of the fact that the control of nuclear forces is only one side of the coin. It is of the utmost importance to reduce the level of conventional armaments. The spectre of nuclear annihilation should not lead us to underestimate the terrible casualties and material destruction which these weapons can cause. Since 1945 this has been borne out by more than 100 conventional wars.150.	That is one of the reasons why we look forward to the conference on disarmament in Europe  soon to be convened at Stockholm. Its first stage will be devoted to the negotiation and adoption of confidence- and security- building measures which will be militarily significant  binding  verifiable and applicable to the whole of Europe.The members of the European Community reiterate their conviction that the building of confidence among States not only in Europe but world-wide plays a significant role in facilitating progress in arms control and disarmament.151.	At the same time  those members of the Community participating in the negotiations at Vienna on mutual and balanced force reductions remain firmly committed to reaching an effective agreement which would genuinely enhance stability and strengthen security in Europe and pave the way to other important developments in the Held of disarmament.152.	The Community also stands fully behind every substantial and realistic effort made at Geneva by the sole multilateral negotiating body  the Committee on Disarmament. The members of the Community therefore strongly plead for the intensification of current negotiations in the Committee. They underline the importance of early progress towards a comprehensive and reliably verifiable ban on all chemical weapons  in order to eliminate this whole category of weapons. They also support the examination by the Committee on Disarmament of questions related to the prevention of an arms race in outer space.153.	Finally  the European Community considers the United Nations to be an essential and most valuable forum for discussion at world level of disarmament and arms control matters. It believes that the dialogue aimed at security and peace for all peoples must be pursued vigorously.154.	Before concluding my remarks on this vital issue I would like to stress our firm conviction that  in parallel with disarmament efforts  all States  big and small  powerful and weak  nuclear and non-nuclear  should adhere to the provisions of the Charter and of international law in general  to ensure the renunciation of force and the threat of force and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. In this context we consider the adoption by the General Assembly last year of the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes to be a positive step. The European Community hopes the goals of the Declaration  vitally important to international peace  may be achieved through the joint efforts of all Members of the Organization.155.	In the Middle East the consequences of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  which the 10 members of the European Community have vigorously condemned  are still with us. The country has found itself in the throes of a conflict which could have led to its disintegration. The civilian population has suffered greatly in the crossfire of the warring factions and by the intervention of foreign elements. The members of the Community  who have always supported the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and the authority of its Government  welcome the cease-fire which was put into effect yesterday. They hope that the dialogue about to be initiated will lead to national reconciliation and ensure the unity of the country. They also stress the need for early progress towards the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces with the exception of those whose presence might be required by the Lebanese Government. They are ready to work for these objectives  jointly and individually.156.	A direct consequence of the stalemate in Lebanon is that no progress has been made towards the solution of the broader Arab-Israeli conflict. It is the view of the European Community that peace will not prevail unless the security and legitimate interests of alt States and peoples are taken into account. To be more specific  a lasting peace can be built only on the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to a secure existence and on justice for all peoples  including recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  with all that this implies.160. A way to peace was indicated by President Reagan's initiative of 1 September 1982/ and the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez  demonstrated a readiness for it. The Community appeals to all the parties in the conflict to move forward from a readiness for peace  which all of them have expressed in the past  towards mutual recognition as partners in genuine negotiations on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). These negotiations will have to embrace all the parties concerned  including the Palestinian people  and the PLO will have to be associated with them. The threat or use of force must be renounced by all. 161. In the interest of the search for peace  the European Community asks Israel to abandon its policy of gradual annexation and of unilaterally creating new facts in the occupied territories  in particular its settlement policy  which is contrary to international law and a major and growing obstacle to peace efforts.162.	For their part  the members of the Community are closely associated with such efforts  as demonstrated by  among other things  their continuing support of the peace-keeping role of the United Nations and the multinational forces. Having a deep interest in the future of the area  they intend to maintain their contacts with all parties and to use their influence to encourage movements towards compromise and negotiated solutions.163.	Another aggravating factor in the Middle East is the continuing war between Iran and Iraq. The members of the Community strongly deplore the lack of progress towards the solution of this conflict  which constitutes a serious threat to the stability of the region and to international security and entails heavy suffering for the two peoples involved. They appeal urgently to the two belligerents to spare the civilian population and to abide by all international conventions applicable in time of war. In this respect they welcome the report of the United Nations mission's which visited areas subjected to attacks. On the other hand  the Community deeply regrets that none of the peace initiatives undertaken hitherto has succeeded in bringing the fighting to an end. It takes this opportunity to call once more for a cease-fire  the cessation of all military operations and the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized frontiers  and for a just and honourable settlement  negotiated in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council and acceptable to both parties. The members of the Community confirm their readiness  if requested by both parties  to participate in the efforts aimed at restoring peace in the area.164.	If in the Middle East the situation has deteriorated over the past 12 months  little or no progress has been registered on a number of other international problems.165.	In Afghanistan the Soviet occupation continues in spite of the successive resolutions adopted by the overwhelming majority of the United Nations. The European Community remains deeply concerned by this continuing violation of the independence of a traditionally neutral and non-aligned country. Its members condemn the attacks on Afghan civilians by Soviet forces and remain gravely concerned at the plight of the Afghan refugees who have been driven from their homeland as a direct result of these actions. These persons represent the largest concentration of refugees in the world  and their suffering must not be forgotten.166.	The members of the European Community stress the urgent need for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and a negotiated settlement which will permit Afghanistan's independence and non-aligned status to be restored  allow the Afghan people to exercise fully their right to self- determination and enable the Afghan refugees to return home in safety and honour. They follow with great interest the indirect contacts between Pakistan and Afghanistan  held under the auspices of the United Nations  with a view to finding a solution in accordance with the Assembly's resolutions. While recalling their proposal in June 1981  the Community members are prepared to support any constructive initiative aimed at a satisfactory political solution. But the key requirement of any such solution remains the withdrawal of Soviet forces.167.	Kampuchea was invaded five years ago and is still occupied by Vietnamese troops  which not only suppress all resistance but also attack the camps of refugees and displaced persons with increasing frequency and intensity. All efforts to end this occupation  with all its consequences for the present and the future  have foundered on the refusal of Viet Nam to comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions. The European Community wishes to congratulate the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations on their initiative concerning the convening of the International Conference on Kampuchea. It considers that the Declaration adopted by the Conference with whose principles it agrees  constitutes a very good basis for a genuine political settlement. The Declaration calls  as we all know  for the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces  recognition of the right of the Kampucheans to determine their own destiny through free elections supervised by the United Nations  respect for the independence  neutrality and non-aligned status of Kampuchea and a commitment by all States not to interfere in its internal affairs. The European Community regards the establishment of the coalition of Democratic Kampuchea under the presidency of Prince Norodom Sihanouk a significant step.168.	In Korea the stalemate persists  30 years after the armistice agreement was signed. The European Community believes that the peaceful reunification of Korea should be pursued by means of dialogue and negotiations based on the 1972 South-North Joint Communique.169.	The situation in Cyprus constitutes a potential danger to the peace and stability of the whole area. The members of the Community reaffirm their position as reflected in General Assembly resolutions 3212 (XXIX) and 3395 (XXX)  which call for respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. They hope that no action running counter to these principles will be undertaken. They have consistently supported the efforts of the Secretary-General  under whose auspices intercommunal talks were established on a regular basis. They welcome his renewed personal involvement in the search for a just and viable solution.170.	In southern Africa Namibia continues to be illegally occupied by South Africa in defiance of international law and United Nations resolutions. The European Community has firmly and repeatedly expressed its conviction that the people of Namibia must be allowed to determine their own future through free and fair elections held under the supervision and control of the United Nations  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We reiterate this conviction today and express our full support for the efforts of the contact group  thanks to which a settlement has been within reach for some time now. We also wish to express appreciation for the efforts of the front-line States.171.	The Community members also thank the Secretary- General for his efforts in fulfilling his mandate under Security Council resolution 532 (1983) and will continue to support his contacts with the parties. They urge all parties concerned to facilitate the conclusion of the negotiations without further delay and to refrain from any action which could endanger an agreement.172.	I might add that the problem of Namibia should be viewed strictly as a problem of decolonizationâin fact  of eradicating the last remaining vestige of colonialism in Africa. The people of Namibia must be given an opportunity to exercise their right to self-determination without delay. Their independence has been denied them for far too long and should not be delayed further because of extraneous problems.173.	In South Africa itself the country's black majority unfortunately continues to be the victim of blatant oppression. The European Community wishes to reiterate its unequivocal and vigorous condemnation and rejection of the system of institutionalized racial discrimination known as apartheid and its determination to use its collective weight  as in the past  to influence South Africa  in order to help put an end to that inhuman system and establish a society in which everybody without exception will enjoy equality  freedom and justice. The Community remains concerned about many aspects of South African policies. In particular  it has condemned the homeland policy and the violation of human rights resulting from bannings and other similar measures.174.	In other parts of Africa internal strife is sometimes an obstacle in the long and difficult road to economic and social development. Such strife is too often exacerbated by outside factors.175.	One such case is Chad. The 10 members of the European Community are gravely concerned by the outside intervention to which this country has fallen victim  and the consequences of that intervention. They firmly support its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and are against any kind of interference in its internal affairs. They believe this problem is an African affair and  consequently  should be settled by the Africans themselves  in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict into an international crisis. They underline the role which the OAU could play in restoring peace. This  of course  should not preclude similar action by the competent organs of the United Nations  including the Security Council  and by the Secretary-General.176.	As I have mentioned the OAU  I should like to pay a tribute to that organization  which is celebrating this year its twentieth anniversary. In the course of the past 20 years it has proved to be a very important factor for political stability and progress in Africa and for world peace.177.	The 10 countries of the European Community are historically linked by close human  economic and cultural ties with Latin America. I wish to stress the importance we attach to further promoting these ties. A few months ago we celebrated the bicentenary of the birth of Simon Bolivar. We pay a tribute to that great man and his struggle for the independence and freedom of the Latin American peoples. We also welcome the growing trend towards democracy in the continent  while deploring the continuing and grave abuses of human rights and restrictions of political freedom in certain countries.178.	I should now like to turn to the serious situation in Central America  which could have repercussions extending well beyond the region itself. The endemic social inequalities  injustice and economic underdevelopment are at the root of the present crisis  which is aggravated by outside interference. In some countries violence and the violation of human rights have become facts of everyday life. Last June  at Stuttgart  the 10 heads of State or Government dearly stated the principles for remedying this situation. They include those of non-interference  the inviolability of frontiers  the establishment of democratic conditions and the strict observance of human rights. The European Community is convinced that the problems of Central America cannot be solved by military means but only through a political settlement springing from the region itself. The Community is prepared to contribute in whatever way it can to this end. It fully supports the Contadora initiative. It notes that the Cancun Declaration of 17 July contains many useful suggestions. It also recalls the endorsement of the efforts of the Contadora Group by Security Council resolution 530 (1983)  which was adopted unanimously.179.	The protection of human rights is a cause to which the European Community is deeply committed  because respect for those rights lies at the very foundation of all truly democratic societies  which are the best guarantee of international peace and stability. We must acknowledge that during recent decades nations with different traditions  ideologies  cultures and political systems have moved towards the adoption of common standards  as well as of appropriate  although not altogether adequate  procedures for putting these standards into effect.180.	It is  however  a matter of deep regret to the European Community that the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  35 years after its adoption  is far from satisfactory. The number of serious and massive violations of these rights in various parts of the world is growing. Many countries seem to have made arbitrary arrests  imprisonment  torture  disappearances  killings and political executions an integral part of their political system. Human beings are persecuted solely on ideological  religious or racial grounds  or even simply because they have the courage to defend the cause of human rights. Large numbers of political prisoners  including trade union activists  remain under detention and are denied respect of their status  as well as their right to defence. Others are denied the right to leave their country or to return to it. Faced with such serious abuses  the United Nations has a duty to secure compliance with the obligations of the Universal Declaration and to react promptly to all violations of human rights. The Community stands ready to approach the Governments of the countries where violations of this kind occur  in order to try to alleviate the human suffering.181.	All States should adhere to and implement legally binding international instruments on human rights and take appropriate measures for their enforcement. The members of the Community are taking an active part in the elaboration of new such instruments and  in particular  the draft convention against torture.182.	Moreover  it is their view that  together with civil and political rights  social and economic rights need to be guaranteed as essential elements of an integral system for protection of the individual.183.	A major event this year has been the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held at New Delhi last March. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  with some 100 members  has become a powerful influence in international affairs. This is fully recognized by the Community  which appreciates the important role the Movement plays.184.	One of the main preoccupations of the third world is the present economic crisis and the measures that should be taken with urgency to help developing countries overcome the difficult  and in some cases desperate  situations they find themselves in.185.	The world economy is at a critical juncture. There are some signs of recovery in a number of major industrialized countries  most notably the United States of America and Japan  whereas in Europe the prospects are less certain.186.	More specifically  unemployment remains high and is increasing  its effects being felt mostly by young and urban workers. The uncertainty of the future and the prospect of high public deficits are among the elements which maintain real interest rates at high levels  thus diverting resources from productive investment to financial management. This reduces the prospects for a synchronized upturn in economic activity and an investment-led and sustainable recovery. Exchange rates continue to be volatile  and this increases uncertainty and limits the room for a consistent economic policy.187.	The global recession has left its mark on developing countries. Their debt has increased sharply  their development efforts have been undermined and their capacity to participate fully in the international economic system has been impaired. They face a severe reduction of their imports and are confronted with sluggish markets for their exports  unfavourable terms of trade and sharply higher debt servicing costs.188.	It is with a clear understanding of these realities and a sense of deep commitment to the need for coordination and co-operation that the Community has participated during the past year in international negotiations with all its partners. The difficulties we have been experiencing over the past few years have made clear to all of us the extent to which our economies are interdependent. The ministerial meeting in May 1983 of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development highlighted this point very clearly. It recognized the powerful economic links between all parts of the world  which imply a collective responsibility to shape policies so as to strengthen the international trading and monetary and financial systems and to recreate the conditions for sustainable non-inflationary growth. The Williamsburg Summit of Industrialized Nations in May 1983 adopted the same approach in recognizing that ""we must act together and that we must pursue a balanced set of policies that take into account and exploit relationships between growth  trade and finance in order that recovery may spread to all countries  developed and developing countries alike"".189.	The open world trading system embodied in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has served the world economy well during more than three decades. Therefore it ought to be preserved and further strengthened. At the ministerial meeting of the Parties to the Agreement in November 1982  the European Community reaffirmed its commitment to resist protectionist pressures in the formulation and implementation of trade policy  a commitment which was further reinforced by consensus at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. In this context  it has always been a principle of the Community that differential and more favourable treatment should be extended to less developed countries.190.	The major event in the North-South dialogue this year has been the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which the Community approached with a positive  constructive and pragmatic attitude  recognizing that the economic crisis threatens the smooth and effective functioning of the multilateral economic system as well as world prosperity. At Belgrade the Community  aware that there is a growing interdependence between developing and developed countries  declared that ""there can be no lasting recovery without resumption of the development process and that there can be no new impetus to the development process without real recovery"". In our view  and despite the occasional disappointments and frustrations  the outcome of this Conference was important. We agreed on quite a number of resolutions  which were adopted by consensus and which cover substantial issues of common interest. We succeededâwhich is politically most importantâin keeping the lines of communication open and the international dialogue alive.191.	In the field of commodities the Community throughout has supported the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities."" We therefore welcome the recent increase in the number of signatures and ratifications  which we hope will lead to its early entry into force. At the sixth session of the Conference we also took an active part in the important decision to start work on compensatory financing of export earnings shortfalls.192.	In the field of trade the Community supported the adoption of resolution 159 (VI)  which highlighted the importance of the open trading system  and agreed to follow policies that would facilitate structural adjustment based on a dynamic pattern of comparative advantage. Increased trade is especially vital for the developing countries. The generalized system of preferences scheme has improved access to the Community's markets for all of them. The Community willâas was stated at the sixth session of the Conferenceâmaintains and further develop its generalized system of preferences scheme until at least 1990.193.	On monetary and financial affairs  the sixth session of the Conference adopted several resolutions. The Community joined in the consensus on resolution 161 (VI) on the crucial issue of the external debt of the developing countries. We declared that we were ready to consider appropriate measures to alleviate the servicing of the debts of developing countries on a case-by-case basis and within the existing institutions. The Community supported the renewed commitment to official development assistance targets  especially VM-a-v/s the least developed countries. We advocated the rapid replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association to a substantial level  and we consider that an adequate level of funding of the development financial institutions is essential. The Community also recognizes the importance of an adequate supply of liquidity for world economic growth. We stressed at Belgrade that a financially strong IMF is in the interest of all  in order that that institution may fulfil its role in meeting its members' financing and adjustment needs.194.	As I said before  the sixth session of the (Conference was the major event this year in North-South relations  but the global dialogue between industrialized and developing countries is an ongoing process. It is based on the recognition of increasing links between the different economic sectors such as growth  trade  finance  development and the fight against the hunger in the world. In this spirit we continue to support the launching of global negotiations to cover all major issues in the field of the world economy. We hope that it will be possible to reach an early agreement on launching such negotiations. In this respect we have noted with interest the declarations of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at New Delhi and of the Group of 77 at Buenos Aires"" earlier this year. In this context I would recall that the Community has over a long period developed an active partnership with the countries in the African  Caribbean and Pacific Group of States  and we shall soon be entering into negotiations for a new convention.195.	Another basic feature of the development policy of the Community is to pay special attention to the specific and urgent needs of the least developed countries.196.	Finally I should like to refer briefly to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  which was opened for signature in December last year. The Community and its member States believe that this Convention constitutes a major effort in the codification and progressive development of international law in various fields. This Convention has so far been signed by five member States of the Community. Some concern persists with respect to the deep-sea-bed-mining regime of the Convention; it should be dealt with in such a manner as to make the Convention universally acceptable. In fact  we attach great importance to the work of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. I hope the Convention will become a useful instrument for the promotion of co-operation and stable relations between all countries in this field.197.	The international economic climate is still far from satisfactory  but history teaches us that times of crisis can be turned into times of fresh and constructive initiatives. The economic crisis still confronting most of us presents a challenge: to promote international co-operation; to promote social welfare; to improve living conditions in the world; and to re-establish confidence in the working of our international system by adapting to changing realities  accommodating diversity and promoting common aspirations.198.	We sincerely believe that  despite the occasional disappointment and frustration at the lack of a consensus  we have succeeded in keeping the lines of communication open and the international dialogue alive. There are clearly differences in experiences  in perceptions of the problems and in proposals for their effective solution. However  it is only through a process of continuous and frank exchange of views that we can better define and come to accept our common interests as well as our differences. We in the Community are hopeful that the international dialogue will lead to a better economic environment in the future.199.	In the midst of a world torn by discord and fraught with fear  the Secretary-General was led to sound the alarm with the report he submitted last year to the Assembly. I wish to assure him that the members of the European Community have given both that report and the one this year all the attention they deserve. They share his concern that the United Nations system of collective security often has not been used effectively and that the provisions of the Charter have frequently been disregarded. At the same time  the members of the European Community share the view that this weakness is not a result of institutional or structural deficiencies but a consequence of a lack of political will of the parties involved in disputes and confrontations.200.	While fully aware of the previous and ongoing discussions about the need to strengthen the United Nations  we believe that the political impulse of the report should be sustained. We share the view of the Secretary- General that his report should not be dealt with bureau- critically or as a matter of routine. The large echo this report received  going far beyond the usual reaction  testifies to the soundness and correctness of its analyses and observations. As a partial remedy to the present disquieting situation  the Secretary-General has suggested a series of practical measures aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the Organization in preventing conflicts. It is encouraging that these suggestions have been thoroughly examined and discussed by the Security Council  which is the organ primarily responsible for ensuring peace and security.201.	We  members of the European Community  believe that the principles of the Charter  which gives expression to the universality of the Organization  provide the framework for the peaceful settlement of disputes all over the world. It is in this positive spirit that we have already initiated a dialogue with several third countries and some regional organizations or groups. They are ready to extend this dialogue to include any new partners who would wish to join in it. The principles which are the very raison d'etre of the United Nations cannot continue to be violated with impunity without leading to the further decline of the Organization  which would become totally irrelevant. Unchecked by the constraints of law  the world would become increasingly torn by violence and wars until the Herniate nuclear catastrophe became inevitable. It is our most pressing duty to do whatever lies in our power to prevent such an appalling development  by reversing the present trend. We therefore appeal to all Members of the Organization  without exception  to comply and ensure compliance with the obligations freely undertaken under the Charter. What is at stake is more than the survival of the United Nations; it is the survival of mankind itself.202.	I wish now  in my capacity as Foreign Minister of Greece  to come back to the problem of Cyprus. In 1974  as is well known to all the Members of the Organization  Turkish armed forces invaded the Republic of Cyprus. This flagrant violation of all norms of international law brought with it death and destruction  and as a result 200 000 Greek Cypriots live as refugees in their own country  while the fate of some 1 600 missing persons is still unknown  for lack of co-operation by the occupying authorities. It is  therefore  obvious that the continuing presence of the forces of occupation in the island renders a political solution almost impossible.203.	Both the General Assembly and the Security Council  in a series of resolutions adopted either unanimously or by an overwhelming majority  have set out the principles which should govern any settlement  if we want it to be just and viable. These principles are: the withdrawal of foreign troops; respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus; and the return of the refugees to their homes. Clearly  the meaning of these resolutions is that the problem should be settled by the two communities without outside interference. It is in this light that the Greek Government views the latest effort of the Secretary-General to explore new possibilities for an arrangement that would be mutually acceptable. We hold Mr. Perez de Cuellar in high esteem. Apart from his other outstanding qualities  he has a deep knowledge of the problem  a problem to which he has devoted tireless efforts in the past. He is  therefore  the person most qualified to help the two communities in their endeavours. We wish him every success.204.	Cyprus may be a small country  but the issues at stake are big. If the international community cannot show that it has the power to enforce the principles of the Charter in such a blatant case of their violation  then it will have failed in its task very sadly indeed.

"58",2849,"GRD",38,1983,"ï»¿91.	 I wish first to congratulate Mr. Jorge Illueca on his election to the presidency of this historic Assembly. His many years of experience  his outstanding qualities of statesmanship and the lofty principles which guide his actions are a matter of record. We all extend our congratulations to his country  the Republic of Panama  which has been equally honoured by his elevation to that high office.92.	I also take this opportunity to express the deep appreciation of my Government for the exemplary performance of his predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  who has made a signal contribution to the strengthening of the Organization and to the search for universal peace.93.	It is a source of real pride and joy that we are able to welcome to membership in the Organization the newly independent State of Saint Christopher and Nevis. We are especially pleased because Saint Christopher and Nevis  like Grenada  is a small island developing country and belongs to the Caribbean family of nations  being a member of the Caribbean Community and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. We know that the Government and the people of Saint Christopher and Nevis share our aspirations for peace  independence and development in the Caribbean subregion.94.	It is fitting that the thirty-eighth session began with the recognition of the International Day of Peace  for it is convened at a decisive moment in the history of mankind. Since we met at our last session  the world has witnessed a dangerous escalation in the arms race. International tension has heightened and we drift ever closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe. However  the consciousness of the stark reality of the dangers inherent in this period is rising and consequently the struggle for peace and disarmament is gaining new momentum among the masses.95.	Closely linked to the increasing danger of war is the grim nature of the economic situation facing the vast majority of our countries. The external debt of third world countries and the dramatic deterioration in the terms of trade of the developing countries are threatening many of these economies with total collapse. In spite of the meagre flows of concessional loans and grants  these countries remain trapped in a virtual state of helplessness  sinking into the mire of bankruptcy.96.	Although the struggle for just and equitable economic relations is urgent  by far the most burning issue facing the international community is the struggle for peace.97.	Of immense concern to the Government and the people of Grenada are the increasingly war-like policies of the United States Administration  as evidenced by the numerous military manoeuvres and the deployment of its troops in almost every corner of the globe. During the last few months the dispatch of United States military personnel to Central America  to different parts of North Africa  the Mediterranean and other areas has demonstrated that country's determination to police the world and to impose its will by military might.98.	These military manoeuvres create an atmosphere of tension and sow the seeds of mistrust  giving rise to international espionage. When  as in the case of the ill- fated KAL flight 007  the lives of unsuspecting civilians are regrettably lost  our duty is to review seriously the policies which may endanger civilian lives and not to exploit a human tragedy for narrow political propaganda objectives.99.	In the light of new and dangerous military doctrines which threaten the survival of mankind  Grenada believes that it is immeasurably important for our Assembly to reaffirm its commitment to peace and peaceful coexistence and to steer all nations along the course of the peaceful settlement of disputes.100.	Our country has followed with deep interest successive rounds of negotiations on the limitation and reduction of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and other related disarmament issues. The apparent lack of political will on the part of the United States Administration to adopt a constructive approach in these matters  creates a gloomy prospect for the successful outcome of the negotiations. It appears that the United States is proceeding on the basis of achieving military superiority. This is clearly an untenable and unrealistic position. The plans to deploy additional nuclear missiles in Western Europe can contribute nothing towards the advancement of peace in the world  since one can reasonably expect them to be counter-balanced by the Warsaw Treaty States in an effort to retain the present strategic balance in Europe. Both measures would greatly increase tension and insecurity and diminish the chances of peace. Grenada is fully convinced that in the event of a nuclear attack all nations would be in the front line. We therefore urge meaningful and sincere dialogue on the part of all nuclear States so that the disaster which now threatens all of us can be averted.101.	In this context  we also express grave concern over the growing proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. We abhor any plans to introduce the arms race into outer space. My Government reiterates its position that Grenada will support any meaningful and constructive proposal from any quarter aimed at eliminating nuclear weapons from the face of the earth.102.	In the world struggle for the preservation of peace and security  the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada expresses support for the tremendous work being done by the peace movements  both in Europe and in North America. The recognition by people the world over that action should be taken to avert the threat of nuclear war and to prevent the further escalation of the arms race is indeed heartening. The People's Revolutionary Government and the people of Grenada reiterate their full support for all those who are daily struggling to persuade their Governments to dedicate their efforts to the achievement of a lasting peace.103.	The foreign policy of my Government is predicated on the cardinal principles of the promotion of world peace  good-neighborliness and international cooperation. Since the beginning of our process of revolutionary change in March 1979  we have proceeded on the basis of a clear understanding that without peace and cooperation there can be no progressive development. When tensions exist  scarce resources are often diverted to military purposes. The resources being spent on armaments could be better utilized in the provision of goods and services for the uplift of the society and the improvement of the material conditions of the people.104.	Our commitment to peace and international cooperation is inextricably linked to the struggle to improve the material conditions of the people of our small country. The People's Revolutionary Government has registered modest achievements since 13 March 1979. Our unemployment figure has been drastically reduced. Secondary education has been expanded rapidly and is now provided free of cost. Our adult literacy programme reaches out to people in all corners of our nation. In spite of the international propaganda campaign  our first and only international airport  the single most important economic project of our revolution  will be officially opened during the first quarter of 1984.105.	Grenada is convinced that peace and development are interdependent. In 1979  at the session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States held at La Paz  my Government co-sponsored a resolutionâwhich was adopted unanimouslyâcalling for the Caribbean to be declared  and recognized in practice  as a zone of peace. Since then  Grenada has consistently urged the implementation of this historic decision. At a meeting in Grenada in 1981  the Standing Committee of Foreign Ministers of the Caribbean Community endorsed the call of the Organization of American States at La Paz and established a working group to elaborate the concept of a zone of peace. One year later  at the conference ofForeign Ministers of CARICOM  held in Belize  we attempted to give clearer definition of the hopes and aspirations of our peoples by calling for recognition of our region as a zone of peace  independence and development. This Assembly has recognized the significant contribution which zones of peace in particular areas can make towards the attainment of world peace. Accordingly  we urge all States to support our aspirations to have the Caribbean declared  and recognized in practice  as a zone of peace  independence and development.106.	The peoples of Central America  neighbours and brothers of the Caribbean peoples  are today particularly and very painfully aware of the real meaning of the world struggle for peace and development. They have waged a long and bitter struggle for genuine independence. They too have a sovereign right to peaceful development. It is an unfortunate fact of history that whenever Central America has tried to develop its own resources independently  to work for the benefit and advancement of its peoples  these efforts have been thwarted by a powerful neighbour whose own overriding interests do not allow for the independent development of States it regards as backyard colonies and banana republics.107.	Today  the sovereign  independent Government of Nicaragua and its valiant people are bullied and subverted for daring to be independent. This is the basis of  Big Pine II   a crass deployment of military forces designed to intimidate Nicaragua and to subjugate the peoples of Central America and the Caribbean. The People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada vociferously condemns the shameful acts of the United States Government and its puppets  who  in defiance of several United Nations resolutions  continue to perpetrate overt and covert acts of aggression against Nicaragua or to allow their territory to be used as staging points for sabotage  subversion and murder of innocent civilians.108.	My Government gives its full support to the appeal made at this session by Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra  that the General Assembly should resume efforts to support the struggle for peace in Central America and that United Nations Member States should refrain from all actions that aggravate the situation in the region. Grenada demands that those Members of the United Nations which are subverting Nicaragua's attempts to attain peaceful and progressive development cease such hostilities immediately.109.	We also support Nicaragua's six-point proposal aimed at the realization of a peaceful solution to the region's problems. We endorse the initiatives of the Contadora Group and all such initiatives aimed at a peaceful solution to the existing situation in Central America.110.	Grenada's position on El Salvador is crystal clear. There we see a valiant people struggling against the might of imperialism and a callous and genocidal oligarchy. A regime which descends to the depths of barbarity and orders indiscriminate bombings of its own civilian population has surrendered all claim to moral authority. My Government has consistently supported the right of the Salvadorian people to establish a Government reflecting their just aspirations. Since its publication in 1981 we have supported the Franco-Mexican declaration which recognized the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation and the Revolutionary Democratic Front as a responsible and representative political force. Two years ago  in my statement at the thirty-sixth session [33r6f Grenada pointed out that the genocidal path pursued for many years by the junta and United States imperialism was not a feasible approach to resolving the conflict. We reiterate that that policy is not working  it will not work  and it cannot work. We continue to support the commitment to a negotiated political settlement in which all forces  including the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation and the Revolutionary Democratic Front  would participate fully and on an equal footing in order to bring a just and honourable peace to this war-torn nation.111.	My Government wishes to direct the Assembly's attention to the constant threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Belize  a member of the CARICOM family of nations. Grenada reaffirms its support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country.112.	Similarly  with respect to the Guyana-Venezuela controversy  the Government of Grenada reaffirms its support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Guyana. It notes with satisfaction that the Governments of the two countries have referred the choice of a means of settlement to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Geneva Agreement concerning the boundaries of the two States  and expresses the hope that that controversy will be quickly and peacefully resolved.113.	We are in full solidarity with the aspirations of the Government and the people of Suriname to build their political  economic and social processes in freedom from all forms of outside pressure and blackmail. In this context we condemn Central Intelligence Agency and other imperialist-sponsored activities aimed at undermining that country's development.114.	We reaffirm our total support for the people and the Government of Bolivia in their struggle to restore the territorial integrity of the Bolivian nation and to regain an outlet to the Pacific with full sovereignty.115.	In the case of the Malvinas  consistent with Security Council resolutions 502 (1982) and 505 (1982) and with the stated position of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries on the issue  we urge both parties to reopen negotiations  with the participation and good offices of the Secretary-General  with a view to putting an end to this colonial situation in the South Atlantic.116.	  In like manner  Grenada reiterates its support for the Puerto Rican people's inalienable right to self- determination and independence in conformity with resolution 1514 (XV).117.	My Government and people salute Panama's steadfastness in its struggle to gain control of every inch of Panamanian territory  including the Panama Canal. Grenada's constant and unswerving support for that country in its historic battle for its rights is assured.118.	With respect to the Republic of Cuba  Grenada calls for an end to the criminal United States blockade against that country and for the immediate cessation of the imperialist campaign of harassment and threats against that upright Government and that brave and fearless people. We call once more for the return of Guantanamo to Cuban sovereignty.119.	The cry of oppressed peoples for liberation  for progress  for peace and for justice resounds throughout the Americas. It is a clamour which all the weapons of war and the might of armies will never stifle or silence. It is a clamour which comes today from Chile  from El Salvador  from Guatemala and from Uruguay. We extend our solidarity and support to the peoples of those countries and to all others who seek to affirm the right to freedom  to genuine economic and social advancement and to a lasting peace. The search for peace  independence and economic and social advancement in Latin America and the Caribbean is only part of the world-wide struggle for the attainment of those goals universally.120.	In the Middle East  the Zionist policy of expansionism continues to be a major obstacle to a just and lasting peace. Today the State of Lebanon is threatened with dismemberment by the Zionists. Our brothers and sisters of Palestine are still being denied their inalienable right to a homeland of their own. We reiterate our unwavering support for the Palestinian people under the leadership of their sole and legitimate representative  the PLO. We are convinced that the establishment of a Palestinian State on Palestinian soil constitutes the foundation of the attainment of the goals and aspirations of the Palestinian people and the main pillar of a just and lasting solution to the conflict. The Grenada Government remains convinced that the people of that region could speedily resolve their differences if the issues were not complicated by the interference of Israel  and it calls for a comprehensive settlement with the full participation of all the parties concerned.121.	With regard to Cyprus  we continue to call for the restoration of its unity  the withdrawal of all occupation forces and full respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country.122.	We also call upon our brothers in Iran and Iraq speedily to bring to an end their sad and wasteful conflict  which benefits neither and which represents a wanton waste of the scarce resources of that region and the third world.123.	We fully support the efforts of the United Nations towards finding a negotiated political settlement of the situation surrounding Afghanistan.124.	We reaffirm our support for the peaceful reunification of Korea. We consider the proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea a sound basis on which to begin negotiations to this end.125.	We reaffirm our solidarity with the people and Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea as they strive valiantly to complete the task of national revival and reconstruction. We view with grave concern attempts by certain forces to escalate their armed interference in Kampuchea. The United Nations should never forget or fail to condemn the brutal savagery of the ousted Pol Pot clique.126.	We support the call for relations among the countries of South-East Asia to be based on the principles of good-neighborliness  stability and mutual cooperation and for the establishment of a zone of peace in that region.127.	The continent of Africa  with which my country shares unbreakable bonds of brotherhood and blood  continues to feel the heavy and brutal hand of one of the great evils of this centuryâthe racist Republic of South Africa and its sadistic system of apartheid. This body has consistently raised its voice against this inhuman practice.128.	Today apartheid is even reaching out to the Caribbean  offering the gold from the sweat and tears of our African brothers to a few mercenaries who are only too willing to play cricket for the amusement of their racist manipulatorsâas minstrels played for their masters. On the question of apartheid the policy of my Government is clear  uncompromising and incontrovertible. Immediately upon the departure of the cricketing mercenaries from the Caribbean for the racist State the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada declared each one persona non grata.. In addition  we called upon their home countries to cancel their travel documents and to confiscate the ill-gotten funds and turn them over to the ANC and SWAPO to assist in financing the liberation struggle.	129.	We pledge our total and unconditional support for the Namibian people  under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole and legitimate representative. We unhesitatingly reject any attempts to make the withdrawal of Cuban internationalist forces from Angola a condition of recognizing the legitimate right of the Namibian people to freedom and independence. We call upon those members of the contact group which have been guilty of delaying tactics to desist from this practice and to facilitate the speeding-up of the process of independence for Namibia.130.	We reiterate our unwavering solidarity with the ANC and the oppressed people of South Africa in their struggle for national liberation. The People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada reaffirms its total support for and solidarity with the People's Republic of Angola  the People's Republic of Mozambique  Zambia  Zimbabwe  the Kingdom of Lesotho and all the frontline States which are plagued by South African harassment and whose sovereignty and independence are constantly threatened by the racist Pretoria regime.131.	We also take this opportunity to reaffirm our support for the Saharan people in their struggle for freedom and independence under the leadership of POLISARIO.'132.	The international economic situation is no less grave than the international political and military one. The quest for a new global economic order is inextricably linked to the struggle of the people of the world for peace and development. As the economic crisis deepens  the wide economic gap between developed and developing countries becomes even wider  while the prevailing world economic system remains unresponsive to the basic needs of developing countries.133.	The establishment of a new international economic order has become an extremely urgent issue if the aspirations of the world's peoples are to be realized. Three quarters of the world population live in over 100 of our countries where poverty and dependence prevail. The external debt of developing countries grew at an average annual rate of 25.1 per cent between 1973 and 1975 and the debt servicing grew at an annual rate of 61 per cent during the same period. It is estimated that in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development [OFCD] countries there are some 30 million unemployed people  and in the developing countries  which feel the brunt of the crisis  the economic situation is even more appalling. In Latin America the per capita gross domestic product dropped by more than 1 per cent in 1981  the first such occurrence since 1959. An OECD estimate informs us that the third world's external debt amounted to about $626 billion in 1982.134.	A grim indicator of the plight facing the populations of developing countries is revealed in FAO data  which tell us that well over 40 million people  half of them children  die every year from hunger and malnutrition. It has been estimated that one quarter of the population in many countries of the developing world suffers from chronic malnutrition.135.	In the face of this tragedy  the squandering of scarce resources on instruments of war is nothing short of catastrophic. For example  in the United States $187 billion have been allocated as direct military spending for the hew financial year  with $115 million going for the manufacture of a new generation of chemical weapons. Military spending worldwide rose during the past year to a record total of $800 billion  according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. It should be a source of anguish to the Organization that some countries in the world seem more interested in confrontation and war than in the alleviation of human suffering. When the world's peoples groan under the yoke of the deteriorating economic situation  they are indirectly pleading for peace.136.	Within the context of the deteriorating economic situation facing developing countries  the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada re-emphasizes the need for a special regime of cooperation and assistance to alleviate the peculiar problems of small island developing States. The recently concluded non-aligned Conference on Small Island Developing Countries  held in Grenada  established a framework to address the peculiar problems of these countries. The Conference also decided to establish a group of experts charged with the responsibility of elaborating a specially tailored programme of concrete assistance from the international community. We issue a special appeal to the world community to come to the assistance of this peculiarly disadvantaged group. The Non-Aligned Movement must be commended for taking this bold initiative. This further demonstrates the relevance of the Movement in the struggle of developing countries for an equitable international economic order  as well as its overall dynamism  its maturity and its sense of responsibility.137.	There is dire need for the restructuring of the major international financial institutions to make them more responsive to the needs of our countries  especially the most affected and disadvantaged among us. Developing countries need to have a greater voice in all policy decisions which affect them in such institutions. The restructuring and democratization of these institutions are urgently required if developing countries are to make any headway in obtaining development financing on better terms.138.	At the same time  we call on all donor countries to increase the level of their contributions to the main lending institutions in the interest of ensuring their financial viability and their capacity to assist debtor nations. The economic survival of the countries of the developed world is inextricably linked to the economic viability of the countries of the third world. Let us not forget that fact.139.	The severe economic crisis reflected in the chronic external indebtedness of developing countries necessitates the rescheduling by creditor States of repayments if we wish to avoid an immediate collapse of many economies. Consideration may have to be given in extremely difficult cases to the cancellation of debts.140.	The failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is a disturbing reminder of the lack of political will among some developed creditor nations and of their unwillingness to promote equitable economic relations with developing countries. My Government once more appeals to the developed countries to resume negotiations and earnestly try to find solutions to the unjust and unequal economic relationships  a major cause of the chronic economic problems facing the developing world.141.	The critical world situation challenges mankind's ingenuity to find urgent and real solutions to grave international problems which seem to threaten the very existence of the human race. As we enter this thirty-ninth year since the founding of this exalted Organization  our first and overriding task must be to work with redoubled efforts to attain world peace with justice and a more equitable distribution of the planet's resources for the benefit of all its peoples.142.	The Government of Grenada is convinced that  notwithstanding its somewhat limited achievements in certain areas during the past 38 years  the United Nations still provides us with the best  perhaps the only  opportunity for finding solutions to mankind's pressing problemsâsolutions which can no longer be permitted to elude us. Grenada solemnly reaffirms its commitment to the United Nations and to the principles enshrined in its Charter and calls upon all nations to rededicate themselves in a renewed spirit of international understanding and cooperation to work out just and equitable prescriptions which will alleviate the suffering of the oppressed peoples of the world and steer mankind away from the path of total self-destruction.

"59",2894,"GTM",38,1983,"ï»¿134.	Allow me first  Sir  to express to you on behalf of the Guatemalan delegation  which I have the honour to lead  our warmest congratulations on your election as President of this session. Your great human and professional qualities as well as your thorough knowledge of the problems under discussion in this world forum guarantee the positive results that we will achieve in our work. Secondly  I assure you that you can count on my delegation's co-operation in the delicate and important tasks entrusted to you.135.	I also wish to express our recognition of the excellent work of Mr. Imre Hollai in fulfilling his mandate as President of the thirty-seventh session.136.	I take this opportunity to pay tribute  on behalf of the Guatemalan delegation and on my own behalf  to the Secretary-General for his great efforts in the search for peace and harmony among the peoples of the world  a task that my country encourages him to continue with renewed faith in the principles of this world Organization.137.	I also bring greetings from the people and Government of Guatemala to the other representatives here  and I feel that this is an appropriate time to welcome Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission to the Organization.138.	I shall now refer briefly to the most important aspects of Guatemala's national policy.139.	Upon taking office as head of State on 8 August this year  General Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores said that the political reorganization begun on 23 March 1982 would be consolidated to  strengthen the foundations of peaceful coexistence and the return to an institutional process leading towards the full exercise of social  economic and political democracy within the context of our Christian and Western culture . He added that:  We are part of the comity of democratic nations that believe in pluralistic systems  in self-determination of the peoples . . . and in the principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other States. Direct contact with the grievances and frustrations of the indigenous population  peasants and others who live in areas of conflict  has made us aware of the great difference existing between political rhetoric and reality for the large majority of Guatemalans . . . In the search for full democracy  our sacrifice and the blood shed by so many Guatemalans are of fundamental significance. 140.	My Government  conscious of the responsibility that it has assumed to lead the country to democratic constitutionality  will observe the following principles. It will defend the people's fundamental rights  such as the rights to life  security and freedom. It will hold elections that will permit genuine consultation with the people. It will bring about conditions that will offer Guatemalans a better life  as well as respect for their dignity  giving them the opportunity to satisfy their basic needs and their legitimate aspirations. It will strengthen organization of the people in various ways  including civilian self-defense  which has been developing as an effective means of pacification and above all of the economic and social development of communities. It will strengthen our national dignity and the cultural roots of our ethnic groups  thus ensuring their participation in Guatemala's progress. It will ensure the autonomy of State bodies. The executive branch will not interfere in the work of the judiciary in any way  so that justice may be done in strict compliance with the law. It will give unconditional support to the supreme electoral tribunal which guarantees the electoral process. It has already abolished the special courts  in order to strengthen the country's judicial system and to guarantee the principle of due process and the right to legitimate defence. It will have absolute respect for the autonomy of the University of San Carlos de Guatemala and of the private universities. It will guarantee freedom of worship and recognize the exceptional spiritual and religious wealth of the people of Guatemala. It will respect the faith and the traditions of the people. Incidentally  the massive demonstration  unprecedented in Guatemala's history  during the visit of His Holiness Pope John Paul II is clear proof of the religious feeling of the people of Guatemala. The Government will support democracy  not as a way of maintaining privileges for traditional minorities which through economic power have had a profound influence on political activity  but as the opportunity for all the people to elect freely  without pressure of any kind  those who govern them. The authorities will guarantee effective respect for human rights. The Government will punish those who  directly or indirectly  try to restrict human rights. It will support respect for freedom of expression and will recognize the work done by the media in providing information and shaping opinion. It will support every process of gradual  democratic change with a view to guaranteeing a more just distribution of wealth. It will give priority attention to the interests of the producers who work the land and to their associations or co-operative or community organizations which seek the integrated development of Guatemala.141.	It should be pointed out that in the context of the political change which began a little over a year ago  important laws have been enacted in Guatemala which underscore the principle that a pluralistic democratic system is the only one through which the world's nations can fully realize their aspirations and satisfy their hunger for the freedom  justice and well-being to which they are entitled.142.	The law on the registration of citizens was promulgated as a guarantee of electoral honesty and of free participation by citizens in the structuring of public power.143.	The law on political organizations is essential in order to achieve the fundamental goal of the provisional Government: the creation of a legal and political structure which will lead the country to a constitutional regime. This system of political organizations is designed to lead to effective democracy  not only as a guarantee of the right to vote  but also as a way of providing appropriate ways to initiate and develop a national dialogue and the active participation of proponents of different ideological trends  thus creating conditions in which the people of Guatemala can achieve the social peace it needs.144.	In this context  the Government of the Republic of Guatemala understands the imperative need to return as soon as possible to a constitutional system of government  and this is the fundamental purpose of the change that took place on 8 August this year. In March 1984 elections for a national constituent assembly will be announced. They will take place on 1 July 1984  and that important body will take office on 15 September of that year. General elections for the presidency and other State offices will take place in 1985.145.	Like the majority of the countries represented here  Guatemala is in the midst of a process of development and is facing the problems inherent in that process. My Government is striving to solve those problems.146.	The development philosophy we hold and apply is based on the concept of an integral development which seeks material improvement while respecting human rights and safeguarding freedom.147.	In the context of that concept of integral development we are working to create a model for the solution of the problems of the Guatemalan nation on a step-by- step basis. Our needs in the areas of housing  health  education and employment are of the highest priority  and they need to be met speedily. But the drop in prices for our export products on the international market  our indebtedness and the scarcity of foreign exchange  among other factors  have an impact on our people and make it more difficult to find solutions to the most pressing problems of Guatemala.148.	To the factors I have mentioned we must add the problems arising from the subversive violence which has plagued some regions of the Guatemalan highlands and which has contributed to a decline in food production and to the forced displacement of a considerable number of people in rural areas who have had to seek refuge in municipal areas. The subversive groups operating in some regions of the country continue to receive financing and supplies from the outside. This constitutes not only interference in our internal affairs  but also a way of prolonging the suffering and misery of our civilian population.149.	A further consequence of the subversive violence is that a number of Guatemalans have left the national territory. They have gone in particular to areas of Mexico close to the Guatemalan border  where several refugee camps have been set up. The Government of Guatemala reiterates that it will welcome those Guatemalans back with open arms  and it urges them to return voluntarily so that they can once again become part of their original communities. In order to facilitate their orderly return  we have requested the co-operation of the Guatemalan Red Cross and the Mexican Red Cross  and the Catholic Church and other Churches have been asked to co-operate in expediting this process. At the diplomatic level  we have continued talks with the Government of Mexico and have maintained contact with UNHCR. Guatemala has acceded to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees ' and we are extremely pleased to announce that the relevant instrument was deposited with the Secretary-General a few days ago.150.	The Government of Guatemala is prepared to make every effort to bring about the voluntary return of Guatemalan refugees  for we are convinced that one of the most important rights of the human person is the right to live in one's country of birth. No one has the right to prevent this.151.	The foreign policy of the present Government of the Republic is independent and uncommitted and has its own characteristics. It is a policy of active and resolute participation in attempts to achieve peace and peaceful coexistence in Central America  and its aim is that the highest values of mankindânamely peace  freedom  justice and the dignity of nationsâshould be achieved.152.	Its guiding principles are based on the ideals of democracy and respect for human  civil  political  economic  social and cultural rights; international co-operation as a prime factor in accelerating the integrated  harmonious development of peoples; the elimination of the social injustice which exists in today's world; solidarity with just causes and attachment to the principles of international law  foremost among them those of the sovereign equality of all nations  non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  territorial integrity  the peaceful settlement of international disputes  the self- determination of peoples and the fostering of international social justice.153.	The Government of Guatemala is aware that the Central American region is going through perhaps the most troubled period in its entire history. In the Central American sphere  Guatemala is exerting every effort to ensure that the problems of the area are solved by peaceful means and through multilateral agreements.154.	It is essential to maintain an open  honest and sincere dialogue to facilitate negotiations among Central American countries. We must therefore rid ourselves of political prejudices and act in good faith so that we can find formulas and alternatives which could lead us to concrete results in re-establishing peace and security in the Isthmus.155.	Our country has unreservedly supported the Contadora Group. We have taken an active part in its meetings  and we believe that it offers a viable means of achieving the goals I have outlined. We recognize and appreciate the value of the creative and realistic mediation of the Contadora countries. We believe that their sustained effort has borne fruit and that there is still hope of a comprehensive agreement. That is why my delegation considers it unnecessary at this point to discuss the problem of Central America in any other international forum. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that my Government has unconditionally endorsed the Document of Objectives  resulting from the fourth meeting of Central American Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the Contadora Group  which was held at Panama City from 7 to 9 September. This document represents a very important step forward in the process of negotiation and establishes solid foundations for a permanent understanding. This step is highly significant and should be considered as an achievement in the quest for peace. Of course  it is solely for the Central Americans to make the decisions leading to formulas for a settlement.156.	Guatemala is an independent country  jealous of its sovereignty  which takes its decisions in absolute freedom. It is not  nor will it be  a possible springboard for any military intervention  as one country suggested  nor is it  as that country is  a spokesman for any Power nor a gratuitous defender of hegemonic positions. It is not our policy to make unfounded accusations or to use epithets which demean those who use them.157.	Guatemala reaffirms once again its commitment to integration in Central America. It considers it basic and fundamental to bring about the economic recovery of the region and is convinced that the economic problems of the area must be approached jointly by the five countries. To the extent that we can overcome economic problems in Central America we shall also contribute to alleviating social and political tensions. The joint presentation of the economic and financial situation made by Central America to the European Economic Community at Brussels recently is very significant proof that the co-operation of all is possible when dealing with questions which are common to the five sister nations.158.	Guatemala is a Latin American country which is loyal to the peoples of the continent  and it takes an active part in the various regional structures which ensure cooperation at different levels on various questions. The Organization of American States [Q4S] is the representative regional body  and at the same time it is an important forum where the problems which concern the region as a whole should be raised  analysed  discussed and resolved. The Latin American countries have signed and ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco forbidding the introduction of nuclear weapons in the region  since our peoples desire peace and fear a nuclear holocaust which could strike a mortal blow at mankind.159.	Guatemala  as is the case with the majority of States represented in this Assembly  also suffers directly from the effects of the structural imbalances in the international economic system which aggravate the internal political and social problems. The continuing and increasing deterioration of the terms of trade is having damaging effects on our economy which preclude us from envisaging any short-term solutions without the efforts and good will of the developing countries and of the international community.160.	I wish to state that my country is aware of the many problems in the economic field that affect international relations as a whole and  when participating in various international forums where this subject is discussed  it strongly supports formulas and proposals aimed at overcoming this crisis. However  we see with deep concern that opportunities to improve multilateral dialogue have not been properly used. We regret that the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has not fulfilled expectations that we could reach agreements of collective benefit and became to some extent a stage for explanatory statements  losing sight of reality and frustrating the express desire for concrete measures.161.	In considering the economic situation in the world  the various approaches agree in their diagnosis that treatment of this question must relate to the progress of recovery and growth in the developing countries  and therefore it should not be considered that the only requisite is the economic recovery of the highly industrialized countries.162.	Distortions in the world economy affect all States to different degrees  and there is above all an effect on the values of the common welfare  justice  security and peace. 163.	Any other criterion will respond only to very specific interests of some nations  since the vast majority is in favour of dialogue  of objective analysis and of open negotiation in the face of common problems  always seeking concerted action which may contribute to freedom from pressures of various kinds.164.	In this context  Guatemala identifies fully with the third world and shares its cause  which is that of development and peace. It takes part in initiatives to eradicate all forms of inequality and seeks the final elimination of the scourge of hunger  poverty  disease and illiteracy. It stands ready to contribute to strengthening the capacity for action of developing countries to attain their goals within a framework of economic and social co-operation. In this regard  we must emphasize and draw attention to the economic content of human rights  which can be fully realized by a people only when they are assured of food  housing  clothing  education and health  in other words  their fundamental rights.165.	Guatemala  as an integral part of the Central American Common Market  undertakes efforts to maintain and strengthen that subregional system of co-operation despite the serious political and social difficulties besetting it. That same desire for integration is found in the broader regional and international spheres through our active participation in all those activities that enable our people to have better resources with which to achieve our development goals.166.	The present world economic  monetary  financial and trade relations are typified by a marked discrimination and unjust treatment of developing countries. This has contributed to the weakening of our economies  bringing about increasing imbalances in the balance of payments  to which we must add an increasingly high cost for servicing the external debt  an increase of indebtedness leading to greater dependency  and a lack of transparency on the part of many industrialized countries in treating the problems which most affect third world countries.167.	Latin America has a very high external debt level  and in order to deal with it we need the assistance and understanding of industrialized countries and the international and private financial and banking institutions. There must be preferential treatment  including extending loan periods and reducing interest rates to moderate levels. There must be Latin American action at the international level to obtain a just and equitable renegotiation which  while respecting the sovereignty and the dignity of our countries  will permit the introduction of new procedures and the maintenance of the rate of public investments  in order to avoid holding up the progress essential for our peoples.168.	Guatemala considers that the recently created Latin American Economic System should be used as an instrument for giving a regional response to the international economic crisis.169.	Latin America is facing this crisis by making sharp adjustments in its economy  with high social and economic costs. So far  in the majority of cases the results are not in keeping with the sacrifices made. A new modality of development should aim at substantive changes in economic relations. Reactivating the economies without significant changes in the areas of commodities  opening up of markets  halting protectionism and the transfer of technological and financial resources would make no real impact in overcoming the situation found in some of our countries.170.	In the human rights Held  a series of internal measures have been taken by my Government which have been welcomed enthusiastically by our citizens and with particular satisfaction by the international community.171.	My Government  knowing that some Guatemalans had been lured by the falsehood of subversive forces  granted a broad and generous political amnesty to permit them to return to their communities and again become useful citizens. The results to date have been impressive  since a good number of peasants and their families have sought the protection of the authorities  and this constitutes a major step towards national harmony. The decision was also taken to broaden the individual guarantees established by the fundamental statute of government to guarantee defense by trial and to safeguard the right of every person to benefit from due process of law.172.	The question of human rights has not always been treated with the required objectivity and fairness in the United Nations. Very often  for political reasons  various countries have been condemned without sufficient justification for the sole reason that they do not enjoy the protection of powerful political  military or commercial alliances. Thus we have seen that some States that commit serious violations of human rights are not even mentioned  let alone censured for those violations. This situation has diminished the moral force of the United Nations and has created certain doubts about its impartiality in the treatment of human rights.173.	We believe it is the duty of the Governments of States Members of the United Nations to ensure respect for the inalienable right of human beings to be consulted in the choice of those who are to guide their destinies and of the ideological system under which they wish to live. Thus it is essential to protect the right of suffrage and to permit competitive and pluralistic political activity so that men may truly  freely and with responsibility choose their own destinies and seek the common good.174.	The fundamental statute of government in force in Guatemala protects and guarantees the full exercise of both individual and social human rights.175.	My Government shares the view that the international community must guide and protect human rights. For this reason it has permitted and facilitated visits to the country by representatives of the human rights commissions of the OAS and the United Nations  as well as non governmental organizations and groups concerned with human rights. We have also been visited by various notable individuals  journalists and foreign correspondents  all of whom have had the opportunity of ascertaining the facts about the situation in our country.176.	From 25 June to 4 July of this year we had a visit from Viscount Colville of Culross  special reporters appointed by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights  who had been given a mandate to report on the human rights situation in Guatemala. That distinguished visitor remained in the country for ten days  four of which were spent in the highlands living with the inhabitants of those areas who have been the victims of subversive activities.177.	On 15 July of this year a mission from the European Parliament arrived in Guatemala and also had the opportunity of checking the efforts made by the Government of the Republic to accelerate the process of integral and harmonious development  of verifying the existing respect for human rights and of learning about the plans and projects being carried out in the highlands of Guatemala  where poverty is most severe and whose needs must therefore be given priority. We have nothing to hide from the international community and  unlike some other countries  we maintain an open-door policy so that anyone may verify that at present there is no reason whatsoever to have any doubts about the human rights situation in Guatemala.178.	My delegation wishes to reiterate in this Assembly the rights of Guatemala to the territory of Belize and also its objection to the independence that was unilaterally granted it by the United Kingdom. Consequently the Government of Guatemala maintains its firm position of not recognizing Belize as a State  nor its alleged land and maritime borders.179.	Guatemala once again expresses its readiness to engage in whatever talks may be necessary and to continue negotiating directly with the United Kingdom in the search for a solution to this problem which would take into account the interests of all the parties involved. My country believes that the dispute over the territory of Belize should be resolved through the peaceful settlement procedures established under international law and that therefore the United Kingdom cannot dissociate itself from its obligations towards Guatemala.180.	The Government of Guatemala is pleased to announce that it has signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are convinced that this legal instrument provides the proper means of regulating the interests of countries in this field.181.	I wish to reiterate to the General Assembly  on behalf of my delegation  my deep concern at the fact that the question of Afghanistan has not been resolved. My delegation considers that the presence of occupation forces in that country violates the basic principles of international law  jeopardizes peace and seriously threatens the right of self-determination of peoples and the principle of non-intervention in the internal or external affairs of other countries. We wish to express our support for the efforts being made by the Secretary-General to find a peaceful solution to the problem and to establish conditions that will enable the Afghan refugees to return to their homes.182.	On the question of the reunification of Korea  my delegation believes that this matter should be resolved by the Koreans themselves through direct negotiations. An open dialogue between the Governments of South Korea and North Korea could lead to options which eventually could bring about the peaceful reunification of the country. A resurgence of mutual trust would alleviate the tensions in that peninsula.183.	We urge the Governments of North Korea and South Korea to encourage action by the Secretary-General in leading his good offices to assist in finding the solution to the Korean question. The United Nations cannot and must not remain indifferent to this problem.184.	Guatemala is deeply committed to peace and therefore it considers it relevant to express its concern in the Assembly with regard to an item that is very important for the peace and security of the world. The arms race  especially in the nuclear field  has entered a new and dangerous escalation. While the possession and use of nuclear weapons and technology are mainly in the hands of the great Powers  my country considers that limitation in this field must exist also on the American continent.185.	In the inter-American system we have the Treaty of Tlatelolco to which Guatemala is a party  as an instrument designed to prevent Latin America from entering an arms race of this kind.186.	When I referred to Central American problems I mentioned that one of the items discussed among the Central American foreign ministers and the Contadora Group has been that of the arms race in the region. An increase in sophisticated armament in the Central American area would aggravate and complicate the situation  with serious consequences for the development process of the countries of that area  depleting even more the scarce resources available  which are essential for meeting the basic needs of our peoples.187.	If the economic resources that the great Powers allocate to military spending and to increasing their arsenals were devoted instead to assistance programmes for developing countries  no doubt the situation of humanity would be quite different.188.	The arms race in Central America has given rise to illegal arms trafficking for subversive activities. This factor has been considered by the Central American foreign ministers and the Contadora Group when discussing the arms race in the region.189.	With regard to the downing of the South Korean airliner  the delegation of Guatemala wishes to repeat what it has already said in the Security Council on this matter of such importance: the downing of an aircraft of the Korean airline by the Soviet Union has no justification whatsoever and constitutes an absurd and reprehensible act which endangers the security of international civil aviation.190.	The zeal to protect sovereignty should not lead any country  no matter how powerful  to the extreme of not respecting defenseless human lives when persons using a commercial airliner consider themselves protected by the international rules governing civil aviation.191.	My delegation believes that this matter should be thoroughly investigated by the relevant organs of the United Nations and that the parties directly concerned in this incident must lend their full co-operation in order to ascertain exactly what happened.192.	Guatemala cannot but strongly condemn this infamous deed.193.	With regard to British military action in the Malvinas Islands  Guatemala confirms its position of support and solidarity with the Argentine Republic. It recognizes the legitimate rights of that sister nation over the islands and expresses its deep concern over the establishment of British military bases in the South Atlantic  which demonstrates a wish to resolve this dispute by force.194.	Aware that the maintenance of colonial situations in the American continent and anywhere else in the world is incompatible with the United Nations ideal of universal peace  my delegation expresses the hope that the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom will resume negotiations and find a peaceful solution as soon as possible. At the same time  we welcome the efforts made by the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices with a view to helping the parties to achieve that objective.195.	The persistence of conflicts and the outbreak of new military clashes in various regions unduly increase tension and endanger international peace. The United Nations cannot remain indifferent; it must act in accordance with the Charter  so that the international community may overcome the risk of widespread conflagrations when there are no regional solutions or when such solutions have not been attempted.196.	With regard to the problems of the Middle East  Guatemala has always had a well-defined position: to recognize and respect the independence of the State of Israel. At the same time  we consider that the aspirations of the Palestinian people to self-determination and settlement in their own territory must be backed by the international community  if we wish genuine peace and security restored to the area.197.	We are concerned and also moved at the suffering of the Lebanese people  which for many years has been the victim of aggression and violence. We believe Lebanon should be given the opportunity of free determination and that the foreign forces which have so severely limited its sovereignty should be withdrawn promptly and in an orderly fashion. To avoid further bloodshed  all parties must respect the cease-fire that has been agreed upon.198.	Guatemala cannot remain indifferent to the policy of apartheid practised by the Government of South Africa. It is unthinkable in today's world that measures of racial segregation should be applied  measures which so deeply wound human dignity. We sincerely hope that this absurd and unjust racial policy will be eliminated once and for all.199.	Guatemala believes that the United Nations is facing the most important challenge in its history. More than an open forum for continuous dialogue and a centre for debating and discussing not only political questions but also economic  social and cultural matters  the United Nations must once again be an effective instrument for detente and peace.200.	The sovereign equality of States presupposes the same rights and the same obligations for each Member of the Organization  and for that reason it is essential to show a great sense of responsibility  objectivity and solidarity. Those who see in the United Nations only a sounding-board for sectarian propaganda are sadly mistaken and undermine the Organization. The moral authority of the United Nations must be recovered  and to the extent that its actions are in keeping with the principles and values contained in the Charter  its weight and its resolutions will have true validity.201.	The United Nations continues to be a beacon of hope in a somber world beset by East-West confrontation which threatens to unleash an indescribable nuclear tragedy. Regional and internal conflicts in many developing countries  which are sometimes taken advantage of by the hegemonic Powers  are potential elements for worsening the world situation. Humanity must put an end to the wave of uncontrolled violence and reflect on its destiny. Man  the most sublime creature on Earth  with his attributes and virtues  feelings and emotions  and especially his intelligence which allows him to reason and to distinguish good from evil  has the moral duty to learn to respect the integrity and the dignity of his fellow human beings and internally and externally to respect the elementary norms of peaceful coexistence. Threat  coercion and force must be eschewed as a means of imposing ideological systems. The individual and social rights of man must be preserved so that each and every human being may freely and responsibly define his own destiny in a manner compatible with that of the others. Human nature cannot be subjugated and  therefore  State totalitarianism has been short-lived throughout history. Human beings have the inherent right to their full development  and the State and the international community must ensure that this is fully achieved. 	"
"60",2939,"GUY",38,1983,"ï»¿190.	Mr. President  the Assembly convenes at a time when international relations are increasingly characterized by tensions and turmoil  fear of nuclear disaster and widespread concern about troubled economies. In view of this grave situation  it is not inappropriate for me to recall the circumstances which led to the creation of the United Nations and the expectations which this engendered.191.	The outcome of the 1939-1945 war reinforced the convictions of peoples of the victor nations and others that military conquests  colonial exploitation and economic deprivation were irreversibly in retreat and would be ended for all time. People therefore looked upon this Organization as a repository of their hopes and their aspirations to live in peace as free peoples  able to determine their own political  economic and social goals  free from external interference and intervention. They also expected that  so that the Organization could be fully effective  those States which violated the purposes and principles of the Charter would be subject to the full force of its provisions.192.	In fashioning that framework for harmonious relations among States  the States of our region  Latin America and the Caribbean  made a most significant contribution. Our States played a vanguard role in the elaboration of the Charter of the United Nations and in the promotion of peace based upon the rule of law and the principles of equity. That is why  Sir  it is matter of especial pride for Guyana that you  Jorge Illueca  an eminent son of our region  a distinguished scholar and diplomat of Panama  are presiding over the deliberations of this session. May I  with your permission  on a more personal note advert to the deep and abiding friendship which you and I have developed over the years as we have worked together  here and elsewhere  in the cause of freedom and independence. I pledge to you Guyana's full and unstinted co-operation  particularly in our capacity as one of your Vice-Presidents. You succeed Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  who guided the affairs of the thirty- seventh session with calm  skill and efficiency. We wish you every success.193.	It is a fortunate circumstance that at this time the Secretary-General also hails from our region. Since his assumption of office Mr. P6rez de Cu6Har has demonstrated qualities of fair play and diplomatic finesse which I have already experienced. His commitment to peace and his rigorous employ of the patient ways of diplomacy are attributes which command universal admiration. Indeed  this commitment to peace has found expression in his profound concern for the effectiveness of the Organization.194.	The perceptive analyses in the Secretary-General's reports last year and this year have highlighted the need for new operational arrangements and modalities which will free the institution from the constraints imposed by an earlier bipolar world and make it more responsive to today's realities. The Secretary-General's overriding concern is to make the Organization function properly as an instrument of peace and development.195.	In the face of the deteriorating world situation  the Secretary-General has called for a recommitment of all States to the principles of the Charter and has sought to enhance the Organization's ability to discharge its responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security and for the strengthening of international co-operation. His expressions of concern are so timely and telling that support for them should require no prompting  for they deal in essence with the survival of humanity. Regrettably  however  the collective response to the Secretary-General's observations has not matched the gravity of the situation which his concern reflects. We owe it to him and to ourselves to give greater attention to his proposals during this session. The Secretary-General knows that he can rely on Guyana's support.196.	There have been vast and fundamental changes in the international system since the creation of the Organization. The quantitative expansion of its membership has given rise to qualitative changes and has rendered more complex the harmonization of relations between States and between regions  complexities also manifested in the relations between competing social systems. Despite these changesâor perhaps because of themâafter 38 years the dreams  hopes and aspirations of people have remained essentially unchanged.197.	Yet crises in international relations proliferate; in fact  there is an air that can be described as crisis-mongering. While new flash-points erupt  old situations continue to defy solutions.198.	Too often  countries which espouse non-intervention practice intervention in one form or another. Too often  countries which proclaim adherence to the principle of territorial integrity are themselves in breach of that very principle. Too often  countries which profess commitment to development are acting to the detriment of the poor. Too often  countries which portray themselves as advocates of disarmament are escalating the arms race  thereby raising the threshold of fear. Too often  countries while preaching peace are stoking the Ores of war  and the language of reasoned discourse becomes consumed in the process.199.	In sum  there is a widening and alarming gap between rhetoric and action. The result is that the fabric of peace is imperilled.200.	Nothing so dramatically symbolizes the fragile nature of peace as the parlous nature of the international economic situation. But this need not be so. A few years ago the prospects for international economic co-operation seemed brighter  and this was contemporaneous with the growing realization of the interdependence of economies âin trade  money and finance  and commodities. Today  unfortunately  there is a marked tendency for some major Powers to eschew the imperatives of multilateral cooperation. Instead  there are increasing attempts to place multilateral institutions at the service of narrower national interests and to frustrate their role. Some may ask if these attempts do not subvert the very objectives of those institutions.201.	The developing countries  whether acting individually or in concert  have been staunch advocates of equitable and mutually beneficial economic relations. We demonstrated both at the recent Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  at New Delhi  and in the Buenos Aires Platform adopted at the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 3 our willingness to advance new strategies for enhancing international co-operation. Serious attention was given to the problems which beset the international economy  more particularly the burgeoning debt problems  the burning question of money and finance and the protectionist measures against the exports of developing countries. Regrettably  these reasonable positions did not stimulate appropriate responses on the part of the industrialized countries.202.	The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which focused on some of these issues  was noteworthy for the lack of convergence of views. It therefore stands as a sad testimony to the constraints imposed upon international economic cooperation.203.	The capacity of the developing countries to promote their development is thus considerably restricted. The continuation of this condition could accentuate social pressures. It could also give rise to upheavals to an extent that adversely affects domestic and regional peace and renders more difficult the recovery of the economies of the industrialized countries themselves.204.	Those considerations apart  it is difficult to reconcile human need with human waste and foolhardiness. How do we justify expenditures in excess of 600 billion dollars cash year on instruments of death and destruction while there is incessant argument every year over the allocation of a few billion for multilateral financing for development? Is that not more than enough for legitimate defence needs?205.	The utilization of vast resources for the acquisition of massive amounts of armaments has direct and far- reaching consequences for the development of the developing countries. Continued global and regional tensions have led States to divert resources from urgent developmental activity to military expenditure. It is thus imperative that collectively we seek to reduce such tensions and  more specifically  to work resolutely for the achievement of disarmament.206.	There are other situations in respect of which the Organization's efforts have not yet led to durable solutions. The Middle East situation festers dangerously. Instability and tension in the region have grown worse since Israel's invasion of Lebanon last year. The Palestinian people  led by the PLO  still suffer the nightmare of being a nation without a State  with the restoration of their national rights unfulfilled.207.	The tragedy of some divided countries remains. In Cyprus foreign occupation continues despite initiatives by the Secretary-General undertaken on the basis of the decisions of the Organization. We should persevere with our efforts to restore the unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus. Likewise  the people of Korea remain divided notwithstanding the communiquÃ© of 4 July 1972   and the constructive proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.208.	No one can deny the Organization's most helpful role in its support for peoples that have struggled against colonialism and apartheid. Our achievements have been remarkable; we should be proud of that record. We must now therefore intensify the struggle against the racists of South Africa. How much longer  I ask  must the people of Namibia  led by SWAPO  and those in the international community who support their valiant struggle be subjected to the prevarications and machinations of the Pretoria regime? How much longer can the oppressed people of Namibia and South Africa place their faith in words of support uttered by some Members of this Organization when their very deeds buttress their oppressors?209.	Even as we bring to bear our collective strength to tackle those old problems  we are confronted by new situations of turbulence  situations the causes of which can lead  if not properly understood  to new tensions creating instability beyond the narrow focus of their origins. Central America is a most poignant case.210.	When they met at Port of Spain in July this year  the heads of Government of the Caribbean Community expressed deep concern over the situation in Central America. They observed that  the crisis faced by the peoples of this region was rooted not in East-West ideological rivalry but in deep-seated social and economic ills . They  appealed to the contending parties to engage in direct dialogue and expressed support for the efforts of the Contadora Group to bring peace to the area . That position should  I suggest  be endorsed by this Organization.211.	The independence and territorial integrity of Belize are still threatened by neighbouring Guatemala. Guyana reaffirms its solidarity with and total support for the people of Belize and for the preservation of their national patrimony and their right to build their society within existing frontiers.212.	Elsewhere new regional conflicts  some internal in origin and others arising from rivalries between outside States  are proving intractable. Guyana adds its voice to the call for an early end to the costly war between Iraq and Iran  and we urge all States  large and small  never to abandon the methods of the peaceful settlement of disputes and controversies.213.	In assessing the state of international relations today and the prospects for the future  a tribute must be paid to the contribution of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. From its inception the Movement has placed in the forefront of its activities the pursuit of policies which could mitigate conflicts  promote independence and facilitate the building of a lasting infrastructure for peace. The Movement has since attracted more States to its principles and policies. It has been an influential factor in international relations. The important role of the Movement is now so widely acknowledged that States which for one reason or another cannot be direct participants in its activities assiduously seek to influence the outcome of its deliberations  sometimes malevolently.214.	Our Movement has always assigned a central role to the United Nations as a harmonizer of competing interests and has consistently maintained that there is a viable alternative to a system of international relations based on bloc politics  on hegemony and on spheres of influence. The political and economic programmes of action which the Movement articulated at its conference at New Delhi provide a coherent and internally consistent strategy for making the peaceful coexistence of States and social systems a real possibility.215.	I suggest that  equally  in charting the way forward we should take cognisance of the role of regional and subregional organizations. Such organizations are to be found everywhere  and the dynamism which the people of their member States ascribe to them attests to the constructive role which multilateralism can play in international relations. That is why we can only regret the studied efforts of some major Powers to bypass these organizations by advancing so-called theological positions. At the same time we need to recognize that regional efforts can be maximized when they are supportive of our Organization  for the Organization is based on the principle of universality  not of exclusivity. Let me therefore here and now whole-heartedly welcome Saint Christopher and Nevis as our newest Member State.216.	Let me also express the hope that those regional organizations and arrangements which still maintain exclusionary provisions in their charters and in their operations will make the necessary accommodations. One example which springs to mind relates to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America  the Treaty of Tlatelolco. The States parties to that Treaty gave an undertaking to the Assembly to remove impediments. Guyana still awaits definitive action in this regard.217.	Another development for peace has been the movement among countries of the South to develop co-operation among themselves. This is a development which should be encouraged by the international community.218.	Critical to our quest for peace is the overwhelming need for the removal of ideological concerns from the international economic agenda  for such concerns serve to spread the tensions of super-Power rivalry to the areas of development and international economic co-operation. We must allâall of usârespect chosen developmental paths and refrain from waging ideological warfare in economic terms. Pluralism of development strategies is and must be respected as a concomitant of ideological pluralism.219.	The intrusion of ideological concerns into international economic co-operation is made more unpalatable by increasing resort to discriminatory measures. The incidence of vetoing funds from multilateral institutions must be discouraged and deplored.220.	I have sought to construct my statement on what I perceive to be a universal search for truth  understanding and peace. I have eschewed detailed references to some situations of conflict  actual and potential. However  certain unfortunate distortions of substance and of interpretation concerning my country and the historical course of relations between Guyana and Venezuela made by the Foreign Minister of Venezuela in his statement at the 5th meeting oblige me to respond and to set the record straight.221.	The struggle to preserve Guyana's territorial integrity never ceases to engage the energies and the attention of its Government and people because of the untenable claim to over two thirds of the country which Venezuela has been actively pursuing. We desire most ardently to free ourselves of this burden which we bore even before our independence and to remove this canker from relations between ourselves and our western neighbour. We wish to rid ourselves and our region of the potential for conflict which is inherent in this Venezuelan claim and the manner in which it has often been pursued.222.	Contrary to what the Foreign Minister of Venezuela sought to imply in his address to the Assembly  Guyana  which has made no claims to Venezuelan territory  continues the search for a solution which would bring to an end the controversy that has arisen as a result of Venezuela's unilateral and inexplicable decision to declare null and void an internationally binding agreement. This agreement is the Arbitral Award of 1899  on the basis of which our boundary with Venezuela was settled.223.	When the Prime Minister of my country addressed the Assembly during the thirty-sixth session and when I did so at the last session	thefacts of this issue were adequately presented. Those facts remain a matter of historical and public record  and they cannot be altered by wishful thinking. Realities are not created by whims and fancies.224.	Last year I made certain proposals before the Assembly  proposals fully in accordance with the Geneva Agreement of 1966 for the involvement of the International Court of Justice  the Security Council or the Assembly in the search for a peaceful settlement of the controversy. The Foreign Minister of Venezuela rejected my proposals summarily. I am glad to say  however  that another stage of the Geneva Agreement has been reached. In accordance with article IV of that Agreement  the Secretary-General has been requested to choose a means of peaceful settlement from among the various procedures set out under Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations.225.	To facilitate the more effective discharge of his duties and responsibilities under the Geneva Agreement  the Secretary-General has sought certain assurances from Venezuela and from Guyana. These were the subject of a communiquÃ© which the Secretary-General issued following a visit of his emissary to the two countries in August last. The communiquÃ© recorded inter alia the assurance that both parties would adopt all measures that might be necessary in order to foster and maintain the most favourable climate for the effective application of the Geneva Agreement. Significant also was the assurance that both parties would refrain from any action whatsoever which might make more difficult or impede the peaceful settlement of the controversy.226.	While the Secretary-General pursues his initiatives  Guyana believes that these assurances  if fully honoured  can themselves also contribute to the creation of a regime of peaceful relations between Guyana and Venezuela.227.	In the past  Guyana has always been unswerving in its commitment to achieving the goal of a peaceful settlement of the controversy and has honoured every agreement relating to our border with Venezuela. I wish to assure the Assembly that Guyana intends to continue so doing. Regrettably  we have had cause  time and again  to draw the attention of the Assembly and the Security Council to violations by Venezuela of the letter and spirit of agreements solemnly subscribed to by both our countries. We sincerely hope that Venezuela will respect the undertaking it gave to the Secretary-General last August.228.	It is my hope that in this year  when the bicentenary of the birth of Simon Bolivar is being celebrated  we will all be guided by Bolivar's essential political credo on international relations and act in the belief that international problems must find their solution in a  league of free peoples which will resist aggression with armed might and settle controversies between its members through a court of equity .229.	As I said at the outset  the desire for peace has not altered over the years. In retrospect  the peace which the Organization was created to safeguard and maintain was narrow in scope. Today  the constituent elements  which together can secure peace  are generally recognized as being more manifold. They embrace much more than the avoidance of armed conflict. But we cannot widen the basis for lasting peace unless we free ourselves of the constraints. We must not merely pay lip service to peaceful coexistence; we must demonstrate our belief in it. Nor should we allow ourselvesâno one of usâto be entrapped within a perimeter in which ideas and thoughts remain untouched by the developments which have taken place since the creation of the Organization. What is needed  if today's requirements are to be fulfilled  is a new design for peace  one which is pervasive and which encompasses the interests of all mankind.230.	This Organization is well placed to facilitate the realization of that peace. It remains for us Member States to utilize it accordingly.	"
"61",2983,"HND",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	First of alt  Sir  I should like to express to you  on behalf of the people and Government of Honduras  our congratulations on your election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. This election constitutes a tribute to your own personal qualities and to your country  Panama  which has in this century successfully waged a persevering struggle for genuine independence and legitimate sovereignty and which is now being given a demonstration of the support of the world conscience  which  in this universal forum  expresses the will of States to work for international peace and security.2.	I wish to express the appreciation of the Honduran Government for the intelligent  discreet and effective work accomplished by the Secretary-General  in the discharge of his delicate tasks.3.	Likewise we wish to express our pleasure at the independence of Saint Christopher and Nevis and its admission to membership in the world Organization. We most warmly congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on behalf of the Government that I represent.4.	The general debate of the thirty-eighth session is about to come to an end. The list of issues to be discussed is eloquent proof of the complexity of international relations in our day  relations that exist in a world whose greatest contradiction is the contrast between the reality of close interdependence and that of every form of confrontation.5.	Undoubtedly  in our day mankind is writing one of the decisive chapters in its history. This is true of the consolidation of new nations following the process of decolonisation  of the efforts to create a just international economic order  of the cessation of the arms race  of renewed interest in the promotion and defence of human rights  of localized conflicts  of the sources of energy or technological advances  all factors which  among others  show how intense are the changes that we are experiencing and that are laying the foundations for the world of tomorrow.6.	Governments  peoples and international organizations are overwhelmed by unmet demands  pointless dogmatism or the uncontrollable pace of events. When this occurs we lose our capacity constructively to influence the direction of change  and conflicts prevail over agreement. Hence our best efforts must be applied so that  with a clear historic vision  we may allâGovernments  peoples and international organizations alikeâcontribute to creating a promising future based on the higher values of peace  freedom and justice.7.	This endeavour seems almost impossible to achieve in this contemporary day in view of a picture clouded by innumerable conflicts and terrible divisions which  although they now affect specific regions  in some cases are capable of provoking widespread conflagrations with the most painful results. It is there  in those regions upset by the tragedy of bloody warfare where reason has yielded to force  that it is urgent to undertake with a genuine spin; of reconciliation and true political will the difficult but all-important task of building peace  strengthening freedom and making pragmatic efforts aimed at economic development and social change.8.	We are contemplating a world divided for all  to use the moving words of a magnificent Honduran poet: a world of East and West  North and South  of opulence and poverty  of strong and weak States  States industrialized and with rudimentary economies  of nations rebellious and docile; a world in which a struggle is waged between freedom and despotism  between the gun and ideas  between justice and arbitrariness  and between totalitarianism and the ennobling force of human dignity.9.	It is as though we were to put together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle of a world divided by disputes and misunderstandings  putting it together piece by piece  creating zones of peace  giving meaning to the very existence of different nations  drawing them away from the polarization that destroys and separates from common grounds for understanding.10.	That clear historic vision of a new and renewed world is reflected in the thinking of the President of Honduras  Roberto Suazo Cordova  who  on taking office  and referring to Central America  said that it  must be an area of peaceful coexistence in which its peoples and leaders can establish and maintain understanding through enlightened dialogue in a zone of peace undisturbed by the warlike sound of polarizing confrontation .11.	I am raising the issue of differences of view because we have heard here voices that for a long time have been interested in converting the General Assembly into a forum for polemics by making bold affirmations in a premeditated attempt to continue to confuse world public opinion. Thus we see a continued disrespect for reality with the intent of diverting the world's attention from the internal problems of certain countries caused by the antidemocratic policies of their Governments  contrary to the genuine self-determination of their own peoples through the free expression of the people's sovereignty.12.	None the less  I have come before the Assembly basically in order to reaffirm  on behalf of my Government  a categorical message in favour of dynamic  pluralist and participatory democracy  in favour of peace for the economic and social development of peoples and in favour of constant and constructive dialogue among the five countries of the Central American region.13.	Central America is tormented by confrontation. Bitter and heterogeneous battles are waged thereâthe fight against authoritarianism  that of equity against exploitation  and of autonomy versus subjugation. Interests alien to our history and particular characteristics intervene in acold game of domination  which attempts to impose regimes contrary to the humanism that nourishes the democratic vocation of the Central American peoples. We are fully aware of the obstacles in our path and of the dangers threatening the ideals that we uphold. We are equally certain that we will not hesitate to defend them. But we firmly believe that for all Central American peoples  without exception  no national or international claims will be satisfied if the benefits of peace are disregarded and destroyed.14.	I mean a peace based on the idea that none of our people will accept to be slaves; a peace built on the conviction that none of our countries should attempt to dominate others; and a peace based on recognition of the fact that the interests of each and every State are better served within a system of regional co-operation.15.	With that objectiveâthat Central America should be a zone of peaceâthe Government of Honduras proposed a peace plan of a regional nature which includes two essential factors. The first is that the problems experienced by Central America proceed from the political  economic and social origins of the crisis and the military and security factors which are responsible for the present grimness of the situation. This therefore requires a global solution. The second factor involves the fact that Central American problems are interrelated in the national  bilateral and multinational spheres. Their solution therefore requires a regional approach.16.	Consequently  from the very outset  Honduras has stated its unshakable will to arrive at multilateral commitments leading to general disarmament in the region  a cessation of the illicit traffic of weapons  and the withdrawal of military and other foreign advisers who tend to weaken the identity of each nation. For this to be effective and permanent  my Government has also proposed that an international supervision and control machinery be agreed on to verify the fulfilment of the agreements reached with sincerity and in good faith.17.	If those commitments are to be trusted by both sides in the atmosphere of democratic stability to which we aspire  they must at the same time necessarily be backed up by a dialogue to promote a process of reconciliation in the search for pluralist and democratic institutions in those countries which are afflicted by deep divisions and bloodstained enmities. The history and dynamics of Central  American societies also indicate the need for us to develop our economies to serve the people  with the help of an international co-operation free of any opportunist selfishness and based on the solidarity of interdependence. The pluralist and participatory development of Central American societies is a prerequisite for regional peace.18.	These are the foundations of our international position with respect to the Central American situation. But we must explain as well the obstacles that prevent our arriving at the objectives mentioned and we must make clear the underhanded attempts to obscure our good intentions.19.	The aspirations of the Central American people  and particularly the people and Government of Honduras  are the strengthening of peace in order to promote economic and social development  and the realization of the basic rule that the human person is the supreme goal of society and of the State  and that the dignity of the human being is inviolable. These aims constitute our civic patrimony in a context of political  economic and social democracy. This is what we seek to strengthen in my country  in co-operation with our neighbours who share equal values and aspirations.20.	Nonetheless  the progressive radicalization of the Government of Nicaragua stands in the way of the achievement of these goals  and has obvious repercussions in the international sphere that disturb and undermine the maintenance of peace and security in Central America.21.	The establishment of a highly authoritarian system in that country has prevented the achievement of the original revolutionary plan and has given rise to the resistance and rebellion of Nicaraguans  who are fighting other Nicaraguans on Nicaraguan territory. The ideological and armed confrontation taking place there is doing substantial damage  through its effect on neighbouring nations  to intra-regional relations  with the risk of serious consequences if the damage is not undone in time through a dialogue that can lead to the democratic system for which Nicaraguans fought with weapons in hand. This is what Central America is appealing for  faced with a revolution of broken promises.22.	The suppression of a dynastic tyranny by a totalitarian  expansionist and aggressive regime has led to the militarization of Nicaraguan society  with two results harmful to peaceful co-existence in that strategic belt of the American continent. The first is a breach of the military balance in the region. The second is a violation of conditions of security by resorting to extra-regional and extra-continental alliances  thus placing the crisis within the framework of global confrontation  and sharpening and complicating the tragic situation in Central America. In the country in question there is a shameful foreign occupation  with the complicity of its present leaders  and it has become an extra-continental enclave  which distorts the national identity of the Nicaraguan people.23.	Faced with this situation  on 1 September of this year the President of Honduras addressed the heads of State and Government of friendly countries  reaffirming his commitment to peace and basing himself on the specific proposals he had already made during the discussions in the Contadora Group  and on the limitation of military expenditures and troops. He said: I can assure you that my Government will remain committed to the search for a peaceful solution to the critical situation in the region. In spite of the climate of international tension in Central America  we have  during the past two years  maintained the military budget of our nation without any increase whatever  and we shall maintain it at the same level next year. Furthermore  my Government has reached the decision not to increase the size of its armed forces  since we have no hegemonic pretensions in Central America and our greatest wish is to live in peace and freedom. 24.	In accordance with those words of the leader of Honduras  the measures that my Government has been compelled to adopt have been limited to what has been strictly necessary for the defence of our country and reflect the right of every sovereign state to self-defence when it is threatened.25.	In the field of diplomacy  my country continues to work tirelessly and unhesitantly for the achievement of a peaceful global and regional solution through the simultaneous discussion of the different problems confronting Central America  Laying the foundations for peace in the region has been and remains our principal task within the sphere of action of the Contadora Group.26.	In a letter addressed on 29 September last to the Presidents of the countries of the Contadora Group  the President of Honduras  in ratifying the Document of Objectives' adopted on 9 September by the Central American Foreign Ministers  which reflects the six points contained in the Honduran peace proposal of 23 March 1982  said that that Document  may help to promote a global and regional solution through the diplomatic channel  always provided that the terms of reference which it contains are based on a firm political will. In this  my Government cannot help but endorse your fervent desire to achieve a responsible understanding in favour of peace  democracy  security and co-operation for development in Central America  taking as a starting-point the intention expressed in the document adopted at Panama City on 19 September 1983.' 27.	In contrast to the Honduran attitude  Nicaragua has adopted an attitude that is in no way constructive  because it is insisting on delaying the discussion of issues of real importance to the present and future of Central America until those conditions are first met that are for its sole and exclusive benefit. The simultaneous examination of political and security questions  such as democracy and the arms race  was excluded by the Government of Nicaragua  which thus not only distorts the regional requirements for a global solution but moreover openly calls into question the expectations and hopes that have been placed in the work of the Contadora Group.28.	There is  moreover  in that attitude another challenge with premeditated and unforeseeable consequences. The Government of Nicaragua has requested the inclusion of an item on Central America in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. The request to bring that item to the United Nations for debate hampers the work for peace which the Central American countries have entrusted to the Contadora Group and places the consideration of the problems of the area outside the continental context and within the framework of East-West confrontation  with the obvious desire to polarize and give a universal character to the crisis which is afflicting Central America.29.	Acts such as those should prompt reflection and alert the universal conscience. We cannot ignore the behaviour of those that in Central America proclaim that they are going to regionalize the armed struggle; those that attempt to internationalize a localized conflict  to place it in the framework of hegemonic confrontation; those that attempt to violate the territorial integrity of States  to hide the reality of the dramatic internal crisis that they themselves have created; those that systematically refuse to participate in a comprehensive disarmament programme and do not allow their citizens freely to express their will  their aspirations and their ideals; those that come to this forum  which is designed for universal understanding  to give free reign to the language of violence which they promote in practice in their own territory  in open violation of the commitments that they have assumed as the fundamental pillars of a revolutionary process that has been betrayed; those that promote actions that destroy the democratic  pluralistic institutions which in neighbouring nations are based on the sovereignty of the people. Those who adopt that behaviour  which is dangerously provocative  are affronting the high ideals of those who seek a durable peace for Central America and challenging the generous purposes which inspire the Latin American work of the Contadora Group  whose failure they desire.30.	Thus we see examples of open intervention in El Salvador; attempts to destabilize the democratic Governments of Honduras and Costa Rica; an alarming increase in the armed forces of the Nicaraguan regime and statements by the Commanders who govern Nicaragua. Our army is prepared to cross the borders of Honduras and Costa Rica; El Salvador is our shield  they have proclaimed. We shall extend the war from Guatemala to Panama  they have announced. We shall support guerrilla movements that are organizing in Honduras  they have affirmed. Furthermore  the head of Nicaraguan diplomacy declared to Panamanian journals that if a peaceful solution to the conflict were not found it would only remain for his Government to declare war on Honduras. That was stated on 9 September this year  while the deliberations were going on between the nine Ministers who adopted on that date the Document of Objectives  a document seen as an encouraging basis for future negotiations in order to achieve a stable and lasting peace. All of this offers the intolerable promise of military aggression and is a flagrant violation of a principle which has been enshrined by the international community and forms part of the legal-political system of the United Nationsâthat of the non-use of force or the threat of force  which is the commitment of all States.31.	Central America does not need words and actions that further inflame feelings and exacerbate fratricidal struggles. Today more than ever before Central America needs the kind of  peace that can extinguish the flames of war.  We need dialogue to replace controversy and negotiation to prevail over confrontation.32.	We have had enough suffering and enough bloodshed. We have had enough persecution and ostracism. The holocaust that has brought death to 100 000 Central Americans in the past five years  the tragedy of 500 000 displaced by internal fighting  the pain of the 70 000 refugeesâall of this calls for urgent action to put an end to that tragedy and anguish.33.	In spite of the threats to regional peace and security expressed by the Government of Nicaragua  in spite of its offensive  dogmatic and provocative behaviour  in spite of its attempts to regionalize and internationalize the conflict  Honduras solemnly declares that it is prepared to commit itself to a general agreement on peace  democracy  security and co-operation among Central American countries.34.	The foreign policy which we have just described in Central American terms could not ignore the painful conflicts in other regions that have touched the collective conscience of the world of our day.35.	In this connection  we condemn the illegal occupation by foreign troops of the territories of Afghanistan and Kampuchea and the recent invasion of Chad by the gangsterism of the fifth horseman of the apocalypse  terrorism.36.	With equal vehemence  my Government repudiates the policy of discrimination and racial persecution which is typified by apartheid in South Africa. It is likewise regrettable that the Government of that country  by refusing to accept the independence of Namibia  continues to violate the right of that people to choose its own destiny.37.	With regard to the Middle East  the pitiless rending of Lebanon  the right of the Palestinian people to establish its own independent State  and the need for secure boundaries for Israel are all matters which demand constant dedication in the search for peaceful understanding that will permit the establishment of an atmosphere of harmony and peaceful coexistence. The Government of Honduras hopes that prudence and intelligence will prevail  so that those much desired solutions may be found.38.	My country also expresses its desire for a just and negotiated solution of the conflict in the South Atlantic and reaffirms its support for the claims of the Argentine Republic to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. We believe that the essential requirements for the attainment of that objective is good faith in international relations.39.	The Government of Honduras wishes in particular to make known in the General Assembly its indignation at and vigorous condemnation of the frightful death of 269 innocent persons  caused by the attack on the Korean commercial airliner. That criminal act by the Soviet Union  which is unprecedented in the history of civil aviation  has met with world-wide rejection and demonstrates the extent of the disdain of totalitarian regimes for human life and their disrespect for the most basic norms of civilized coexistence.40.	To this has been added yesterday's terrorist attack  which took the lives of several South Korean leaders and which must be condemned by free and civilized peoples of the world.41.	I have referred to the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and of the self- determination of peoples  but the Government of Honduras considers that these principles must never be invoked to prevent the international community from taking note of and condemning the human rights violations which take place systematically in countries on various continents.42.	In this connection I am pleased to reiterate that the Government of Honduras observes the principle of the defence and promotion of the rights which are a part of human dignity. Clear proof of this conduct is provided by our efforts to improve the legal system by which those rights are protected  as well as the recent creation by the Congress of the Republic of a multi-party parliamentary commission entrusted with ensuring the effective implementation of constitutional guarantees.43.	While it is true that the world situation is a bleak one  the existence and effective functioning of the Organization will continue to hold out a promise of hope and encouragement for all of mankind. The future of our world is in our hands  and we all share the individual and collective responsibility of ensuring for succeeding generations a life of peace  based on justice and nourished by the pure air of freedom.44.	With that conviction we believe that it is the duty of all States faithfully to align their international behaviour with the obligation set out for all mankind in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948  which came out of the ashes of the second world conflagration of the twentieth century:All human begins are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. "
"62",3052,"HTI",38,1983,"ï»¿45.	 It is a particular pleasure for me to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the Haitian delegation  my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty- eighth session. Your vast experience in the field of international relations  your brilliant rise to the head of the Panamanian diplomatic service  and the objectivity and loftiness of view that habitually mark your statements make you the natural person to discharge the delicate functions upon which the success of our work largely depends. We are pleased that this distinction has been conferred upon the representative of a friendly country  with which Haiti is honoured to have maintained such long-standing  excellent relations.46.	I should like also to convey our gratitude to Mr. Hollai of Hungary for the mastery and skill with which he guided the work of the thirty-seventh session.47.	Permit me once again to pay a well-deserved tribute to the tireless devotion with which the Secretary-General has devoted himself to the cause of the Organization  with the aim of strengthening its role and contributing to the maintenance of peace wherever it may be threatened.48.	The Haitian delegation takes this opportunity to say that it is most pleased to welcome to membership of the United Nations a fraternal Caribbean country  Saint Christopher and Nevis  a country which  we are sure  will make an active and valuable contribution to the deliberations of the Organization.49.	I must refer to the tragic event which took place yesterday. The Government and people of Haiti ask the delegation of the Republic of Korea to accept our sincere condolences and to transmit our expressions of sympathy to the bereaved families of the victims.50.	Last year we shared with the Assembly the Haitian Government's deep concern at the disturbing deterioration of the world situation  and insistently urged the international community systematically to strengthen the bases for dialogue and concerted action in order gradually to dispel the omnipresent spectre of poverty and violence.51.	Today we cannot but express our disappointment and our negative evaluation of recent developments on the international political and economic scene. Undeniable progress has  of course  been made occasionally  but this progress does not amount to a great deal when compared with the proliferation of areas of crisis and the constant exacerbation of the endless sufferings of the peoples of the third world. Tensions between States continue to heighten: sovereign countries Members of the United Nations are under foreign occupation; and whole populations are still under colonial domination  apartheid and other more subtle forms of oppression. And as if that were not enough  we have just witnessed an indescribable act committed by a super-Power against defenceless civilians  in defiance of the most elementary norms of human rights.52.	For certain wealthy countries  signs of a precarious recovery have begun timidly to emerge  but the developing countries are facing a catastrophic economic crisis with incalculable social consequences  the solution to which lies essentially in unprecedented efforts at international solidarity. Such a picture hardly gives rise to optimism. It is therefore more than ever vital for every member of the great family of nations  firmly convinced of the inevitability of our common destiny  to promise faithfully to respect the principles of the Charter of the United Nations so that we can together achieve our objectives of peace  brotherhood and justice  which in the final analysis are in keeping with the eternal aspirations of the universal conscience.53.	In the light of those considerations  the Haitian delegation wishes to reaffirm its position on the main items included in the agenda  items which are troubling international life. In this regard  permit me first to mention Central America  where the cycle of violence has spiralled spectacularly this year.54.	This extremely alarming situation is marked by all- too-frequent recourse to force and has been punctuated by growing numbers of border incidents; it contains the seeds of a permanent crisis whose devastating effect could ultimately extend well beyond the zone now affected.55.	The important thing  above all  is to stress that this crisis stems essentially from the many grave social and economic difficulties besetting the region. Consequently  there can be no question of reducing simply to the dimensions of an East-West conflict what is in fact a whole set of fundamental problems which can be resolved only by the peoples of the region themselves  and they have the exclusive right to define their kind of society and to establish their own model for development.56.	In this spirit  the Government of Haiti faithful to the principles that have always formed the basis of its foreign policy  unreservedly supports the constructive and bold actions undertaken by the Contadora Group countries with the objective of restoring  through dialogue and negotiation  the peace which is the irreplaceable foundation for any economic and social advancement. My Government also appreciates any manifestation of firmness designed to maintain the balance of forces and to preserve regional security.57.	The Republic of Haiti makes a solemn appeal to the wisdom of the front-line States and asks them to reject any sterile extension of the conflict. It declares itself ready to support initiatives which could lead to a balanced and effectively controlled reduction of arms in the region.58.	In the South Atlantic  the situation prevailing in the Malvinas Islands constitutes  as we have so often stated  a sequel to a completely outmoded colonialism. The blood that was shed last year on both sides and the planned establishment  with the complicity of South African firms  of an air base which is not justified by the defence needs of the archipelago  constitutes urgent and imperative reasons for the immediate resumption of dialogue. For that reason  rejecting apartheid imposed by force and unswervingly supporting the legitimate aspirations of the Argentine nation  the Government of the Republic o * Haiti urges the United Nations to promote the search for a negotiated and final solution.59.	The Middle East has for more than three decades been the scene of warfare  and every day adds its share of tragedy to the already blood-soaked history of that part of the world. The recent outbreak of violence in Lebanon proves  if proof were necessary  that the settlement of this regional crisis lies more than ever before in the establishment of overall peace on the basis of the rules of law  morality and justice in accordance with the spirit of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).60.	Therefore the Haitian Government believes that the search for peace necessarily entails recognition and respect by all its neighbours of Israel's right to exist within secure and recognized borders. Similarly  we believe that there can be no question of denying to the Palestinian people its right to effective self-determination within a physical  legal and administrative framework in keeping with its legitimate aspirations. Any attempt to ignore or repudiate these basic criteria for a peaceful solution can only serve to prolong needlessly the ravages of hatred in that sorely tried region.61.	With regard to the question of Cyprus  the Government of the Republic of Haiti wishes to recall that the solution of this problem necessarily entails respect for the unity of the Republic of Cyprus and the withdrawal of all foreign occupation forces. We welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General within the framework of his mission of good offices and we hope it will be successful.62.	The Republic of Haiti has also been following with attention and concern the evolution on the African continent of certain very ominous situations in which too often foreign Powers are involved and which are jeopardizing the stability of the region while holding up the social and economic development of the countries concerned.63.	We deplore particularly the internecine struggle which is at present dividing Chad. The Government of Haiti continues to hope that that nation  jealous of its independence  will ultimately recover its unity through dialogue and succeed in enjoying the full and effective exercise of its sovereignty over the whole of its territory.64.	With regard to Western Sahara  the Republic of Haiti continues to believe in the possibility of a peaceful solution  based on the principle of self-determination in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity	In this regard  we remain confident that the Ad Hoc Committee on Western Sahara  entrusted with the task of organizing a referendum  will effectively discharge its tasks  with the active support of the parties concerned  and that the Sahraoui people  as a result of this process  will succeed in choosing its destiny in all freedom  in conformity with its legitimate aspirations.65.	In Asia there also persist hotbeds of crisis engendered and maintained by the expansionist ambitions of certain  States determined to impose their will by means of an illegal military presence  in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations. We cannot fail to mention  in this regard  the tragedy that is still being played out in occupied Afghanistan and in occupied Kampuchea. We must recall the daily horrors of war and repression. The Republic of Haiti warmly salutes the patriotic struggle of the Khmer and Afghan peoples and hopes that the United Nations will redouble its efforts to promote a return to peace within the framework of a settlement which will naturally entail the final withdrawal of the occupation forces and recognize the exclusive right of those States to define their own form of Government.66.	On the other hand  the Haitian Government has noted with satisfaction the encouraging initiatives of the head of State of South Korea designed to establish dialogue to lead to the reunification of the Korean nation. It is highly desirable that the United Nations give its support to these peaceful actions which in their principles are entirely compatible with the essential objectives of the Organization.67.	Since 1946 the Organization has been dealing with the painful and difficult question of apartheid  which has been condemned by the General Assembly as a crime against mankind. In spite of universal condemnation  the Pretoria regime  far from abiding by the United Nations resolutions  persists in its criminal policy towards the black people of South Africa.68.	The Government of the Republic of Haiti  I would recall  approximately 50 years ago brought before the League of Nations the scandal of the massacre of Hottentots in South West Africa and prevailed upon it to examine for the first time the racial policy of the Union of South Africa. Faithful to these historic traditions  we once again today reaffirm forcefully our unswerving attachment to the South African people and unconditional solidarity with the heroic struggle being waged for the final elimination of the apartheid regime. We urge the General Assembly and all organizations and agencies concerned  in this year which sees the end of the first Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  to make a critical review of the initiatives taken so far  with a view to strengthening the array of measures which would help to overcome the brutal arrogance of the South African Government and lead to the establishment of an open  democratic and multiracial society in South Africa.69.	My Government is compelled to denounce the countries which are actually guilty of complicity with that regime and have provided it with political  economic  military and nuclear co-operation on the highly arguable pretext of having to preserve strategic interests. We call upon them not to oppose any longer the adoption of global and binding sanctions  which alone can put an end to this policy of dehumanization pursued by the Pretoria racist minority.70.	Furthermore  we see the same attitude of defiance on the part of the South African regime in the illegal occupation of Namibia and the systematic blocking of the United Nations plan for bringing that Territory to independence.71.	On this subject  while we duly appreciate the efforts made by the Contact Group  we cannot but deplore the decision of a certain Power to link the process of independence with geopolitical considerations which in any case cannot possibly prevail over the rights of the Namibian people to exercise sovereignty over its Territory.72.	The people and Government of Haiti wish to reiterate their total support for the front-line States and the heroic freedom fighters who are waging a noble struggle under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]. We solemnly call on the international community to ensure that the year 1984 will finally see the implementation of the commitments entered into for the benefit of the Namibian people so that it can become independent  with full territorial integrity  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978).73.	It has become trite to repeat that we are at the moment suffering from the most serious economic crisis since the 1930s and that it hits the poorest among us hardest. In Africa  Asia and Latin America the developing countries are witnessing an almost general collapse of their growth rates and in certain cases this is becoming a veritable catastrophe.74.	The spectacular fall of commodity prices and the subsequent decline in export earnings  the appreciable slowing down of the rate of investment  and the abrupt acceleration of the process of indebtedness combined with a reduction in net terms of international transfers have  in the final analysis  led to a very clear-cut decline in the standard of living the peoples of the third world.75.	Without wishing to go deeply into the underlying causes of this state of affairs  we must repeat that the industrialized nations bear a large part of the responsibility for engendering this tragic situation. Deciding to combat by a policy of draconian austerity the inflation resulting from declining productivity in the 1970s  they have given rise to a global contraction of the demand for goods and services and a sharp increase in interest rates  thus leading to a generalized recession  which has proved to be .an extremely heavy burden on the third-world countries for reasons which are not their fault.76.	Similarly  public development assistance  an increase in which might have compensated in part for the negative effects of this policy  has never reached the targets laid down more than 20 years ago  while at the same time annual expenditures on armaments have reached the astronomical figure of $600 billion.77.	All these phenomena have been thoroughly described and analysed by committees of experts in specialized forums. We shall therefore confine ourselves simply to stressing certain particularly striking facts and making some recommendations which could help carry the debate forward.78.	First  we must admit the failure of international meetings designed to put an end to the crisis. The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  ended up  as far as the third world was concerned  as a bitter disappointment. The Buenos Aires Platform   in which the Group of 77 presented a balanced set of realistic proposals  was met  with a very few exceptions  with a whole host of reservations which were desperately narrow and selfish in nature. Similarly  the Specialized Conference on External Financing  held at Caracas from 4 to 9 September  above all made it possible to observe the irreconcilable differences between the providers of funds and the recipient countries.79.	We cannot help wondering whether  over and above the obvious temporary difficulties on which an attempt is being made to blame the lack of progress  the dialogue between industrialized and developing countries has become completely bogged down.80.	In spite of all this  as solemnly stated by President Jean-Claude Duvalier: The Republic of Haiti continues to believe in the future of global negotiations on the establishment of a new economic order which would make it possible for the poor peoples of the third world to reach a threshold of development compatible with the dignity of the human race and the right of the individual to a decent life. 81.	The Haitian Government believes that in the immediate future we should set up a system of almost permanent regional meetings as a result of which a small number of representatives of North and South could give their views on specific economic subjects so that concrete decisions could be taken over the short term.82.	Secondly  the model for recovery proposed by the Western countries seems to us both optimistic and incomplete  inasmuch as they claim that the recovery which has begun in the industrialized nations will inevitably lead to a resurgence of growth in the third world  provided  of course  that the third world has undertaken in advance the indispensable task of putting its finances on a sounder footing. For our part we remain convinced that this kind of automatism will not work because of structural distortions which prevent the market machinery from having its full effect on the developing countries.83.	In order to make up for these deficiencies  we should set up special programmes specifically oriented to a certain number of priority objectives which constitute the sin qua non of any economic recovery. I am talking about the stabilization of export earnings  the appropriate transfer of both public and private capital and the rescheduling of the third world debt. From this standpoint the Republic of Haiti believes that  if measures such as programmes of financial austerity  which for its part it continues to apply scrupulously  and the Caribbean Basin initiative  which it welcomed with satisfaction  in fact constitute the necessary conditions of our economic development  it is equally true that such arrangements seem ridiculously inadequate when compared with the size and diversity of the needs of the region.84.	Therefore the Haitian Government has begun to wonderâfollowing President Belisario Betancur's statement in a remarkable address that Central America needed $5 billion in order to recover its former level of expansionâhow many billions the Caribbean would need to bring about a rate of growth that would make it possible to meet the essential needs of its peoples. It is for us  together with the major Powers of this continent to give a serious and credible answer to this question  bearing constantly in mind the fact that economic development and social progress constitute  in the final analysis  the best guarantees of political stability and regional security.85.	Thirdly  the clear inability of the international system in its present form to provide the necessary components of a solution for the developing countries should make the third world seek in South-South co-operation ways and means of bringing about its economic emancipation.86.	On the American continent  encouraging initiatives have  indeed  recently been launched to this end  and this is an opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to ECLA and the Latin American Economic System for their remarkable contributions to producing a regional strategy of co-operation making it possible for the countries of the continent to face the crisis by an intelligent reformulation of their external trade and the common exploitation of their vast resources.87.	Because of their structural weaknesses and natural handicaps the least developed countries have suffered particularly badly from the international crisis. Available statistics in this regard reveal  that  over and above the reduction in per capita income and the decline in food production  there has been a substantial reduction in public development assistance  in spite of the commitment of the industrialized nations rapidly to double transfers to those countries.88.	In these circumstances  how can we not entertain doubts about the present international order when even for the small group of least developed countries it seems impossible to bring about appropriate actions and to mobilize the relatively small sums of money needed to get them moving?89.	The Republic of Haiti therefore calls upon the rich countries to change their attitude and do everything possible to carry out the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries   officially launched at Manila in 1979 and endorsed in Paris in 1981 and Belgrade in 1983.90.	This cursory examination of the world situation that we have just undertaken has enabled us to shed light on both the gravity and the complexity of the problems facing the international community and on the very nature of the principles which should guide the States Members of the United Nations in the search for solutions to the many difficulties that may jeopardize the future of mankind.91.	The main point to bear in mind is that there will be no progress towards peace and economic development in a more and more interdependent world without a continual strengthening of international solidarity  without a genuine political determination to bring about change  without a genuine intention on the part of the major Powers to give real effect to the various resolutions to which they have subscribed.92.	The Republic of Haiti  which under the leadership of President Jean-Claude Duvalier is steadfastly pursuing the work of national development in a climate of peace and stability  will continue to play its full role in the international community  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  in bringing about a new order that will be more just and more humane.93.	This year  when we are commemorating the bicentenary of the birth of Bolivar and are paying tribute to an epic to which the Republic of Haiti is proud to have made a decisive contribution  we express the hope that the spiritual heritage of the Liberator  like that of the other great nation-builders  will guide our actions and our thoughts towards a world of peace  justice and fraternity.

"63",3098,"HUN",38,1983,"ï»¿26.	 Let me first offer you  Sir  a warm welcome and hearty congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. In you I greet a prominent personality of the Latin American continent  whose peoples  culture and achievements are highly respected and appreciated in the Hungarian People's Republic. I assure you of my delegation's full support in your carrying out of your important duties.27.	It was the horrible experience of two world conflagrations that led to the great determination of nations to establish the Organization  which is destined  in the words of its Charter  ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". Man's centuries-old desire that nation shall not lift up sword against nation  neither shall they learn war any more"" was also engraved on the wall of this palace of deliberations. But I wonder if we can claim to have come any closer to this lofty goal.28.	I consider this question to be illusory at the present moment of history  which is regrettably characterized by a sharpening of international tension. Confrontation is on the increase and attempts are made to upset the balance of power which is the guarantee of world peace  to obtain military superiority and to reverse the process of peoples' national and social liberation. All this constitutes a source of concern to the people and Government of the Hungarian People's Republic.29.	We see the stepping up of the arms race as the root cause of this dangerous situation. Not only does the unprecedented level of armament threaten our civilization directly  by raising the spectre of a nuclear catastrophe  but it also threatens it indirectly  by squandering mankind's material and intellectual resources  depriving peoples of a considerable part of the results of their labour  and perpetuating economic backwardness in a great number of developing countries. I? this not an absurd contradiction in the century of science and technology  in the era when we seem to be on the verge of solving global problems through such achievements as the exploration of new sources of energy  the exploitation of the wealth of the oceans  the peaceful conquest of outer space  the eradication of hunger and of widespread devastating diseases  and the protection of the rapidly deteriorating natural environment? Can taking advantage of such really tremendous possibilities be imagined without global co-operation? One cannot help wondering  for by the very act of adopting the Charter of the United Nations we solemnly pledged to live in peace as good neighbours and to promote social progress and better standards of life.30.	The Hungarian People's Republic has declared its faith in the peaceful coexistence of States with differing social systems. By that we mean not only the absence of war  although that would be no small achievement either. For us  coexistence means active co-operation and a constant strengthening of mutually advantageous political  economic and cultural relations among peoples and governments. During the past 10 or 15 years  we have gained considerable experience in this regard  and it is my understanding that our partners have no reason to feel disappointed either.31.	Let us look at this in a broader perspective. When  in the 1960s and early 1970s  detente continued its upward trend  important agreements were reached between the great Powers and other States on the prevention and limitation of the proliferation and quantitative and qualitative development of weapons of mass destruction on earth  in outer space and on the sea-bed. The Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which was attended by 35 heads of State or Government  laid a lasting foundation of principle for further cooperation in Europe. Political  economic and other contacts gained momentum. The consolidation of new States liberated from colonial bondage in Asia  Africa and Latin America continued at a rapid pace. Has any people seen its interests damaged by that process? Does any people feel itself the loser because of detente? The answer is no. There is no such people.32.	The Hungarian People's Republic  acting on the mandate of the Hungarian people  still considers preservation of the results of detente and the maintenance and extension of international dialogue and co-operation to be the prime concerns of its foreign policy  both in its bilateral relations and in international forums. For us as for other countries there is no reasonable alternative to peaceful coexistence.33.	That is why we feel concern about any sign of an increase in the mood of confrontation  about any act jeopardizing normal relations among States and about any development adding to the strains of the already tense international situation.34.	The Hungarian Government is convinced that the course of resorting to a war of rhetoric  to smear and innuendo  to discrimination and to the policy of force is wrong and that  in any event  it has been shown by experience to be ineffective. It is an old truth that anger is a bad counsellor. Only reason and regard for one another's interests can be good counsellors  even in relations between countries having differing social systems.35.	I can note with satisfaction that our policy of peaceful coexistence has been reciprocated by the governments of all countries which have a sense of responsibility regarding the development of the international situation. We shall continue to seek wider contacts and more successful talks and political consultations with other countries with a view to increasing mutual trust and improving the international climate.36.	We are glad to see that the General Assembly intends to devote much of its attention to the increasingly urgent question of disarmament talks. During the past years the Hungarian People's Republic has itself taken an active part in the elaboration of several important disarmament proposals  which still stand. Those proposals seek to ensure that strategic parity  guaranteeing world peace  is maintained at the lowest possible level of armaments. Regrettably  however  our proposals have not yet received any substantive response from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.37.	Pending disarmament problems are numerous  and each of them is important. If I single out some of them  it is because I think that they are of particular significance in the present tense international situation.38.	I refer to the limitation and reduction of conventional armaments and the prohibition of chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.39.	But nuclear disarmament is the most pressing task of the day. It must be tackled in order to bring about a radical improvement in the international climate and to avert the danger of war. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic therefore attaches paramount importance to the Soviet Union's commitment not to be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances. I am sure that a similar commitment by the other nuclear Powers would be received with great relief by international public opinion.40.	Implementation of the proposal that the nuclear- weapon States should mutually freeze their nuclear arsenals would  in our view  be a significant first step forward on the road to nuclear disarmament. Furthermore  we believe that an agreement on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests should be reached as soon as possible and that the development of new types of weapons and the upgrading of existing ones should be halted. The emergence of new and more sophisticated systems of weapons raises the danger that those weapons will go beyond the scope of existing agreements and will become ever more difficult to limit and control.41.	Also  we hold that strengthening the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which is intended to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons  and  in conjunction with it  the creation of security safeguards for non-nuclear-weapon States are tasks closely related to nuclear disarmament.42.	The Hungarian People's Republic is directly interested in an agreement that would provide that nuclear weapons should not be stationed in countries where there are no such weapons at present and should not be increased in number where they are already deployed. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace in Europe and in other parts of the world would greatly enhance trust and international security.43.	I should like to underline in particular the great importance of the proposal made last January by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty at their Prague meeting to the countries of NATO to conclude a treaty on the mutual renunciation of the use of armed force and on the maintenance of peaceful relations. Since the overwhelming majority of weapons and the most destructive types are possessed by those two alliances  I think that the conclusion of such a treaty would be an effective measure to prevent acts threatening peace.44.	The Hungarian People's Republic attaches the utmost importance to the Soviet-American negotiations on the limitation and reduction of strategic weapons and is earnestly hopeful about their successful outcome.45.	The peaceful future of mankind would be gravely threatened by extending the arms race to outer space  the prevention of which is sought by the highly important Soviet proposal now submitted to that effect  which enjoys the full support of the Hungarian Government.46.	In common with many other European countries  Hungary is concerned at the planned deployment of new types of American nuclear weapons in Western Europe. Upsetting the existing strategic parity is bound to entail far-reaching consequences for peace and security not only in Europe but also in the whole world. We believe that the best solution would be the complete denuclearization of Europe  an objective which we will not stop pursuing. Until the international situation permits attainment of that goal  we believe that reducing  and by no means increasing  the number of medium-range nuclear missiles is the most acceptable solution.47.	After three years of negotiations  the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has finished its work with the adoption of a substantive and balanced Concluding Document. That document is the first essential and broad East-West accord in many years  and I hardly need to emphasize its special significance in the prevailing international situation. We think that the decision of the Madrid meeting to convene a Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe is of exceptional importance.48.	The successful conclusion of the work of the Madrid meeting at the level of foreign ministers holds out the hope of continuing the multifaceted process started at Helsinki and confirms our conviction that the more favourable atmosphere of the 1970s will not have been a passing episode in the history of Europe and that the future will again belong to the policy of detente.49.	For its part  the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic will continue to work in pursuit of that goal and will strive  as it has striven in the past  for the full implementation of the principles and recommendations embodied in the Helsinki Final Act and the Madrid Concluding Document. We feel privileged that Budapest has been chosen to be the venue for the cultural forum to be held in 1985  as decided by the Madrid meeting  and we shall make every effort to ensure the success of that important event.50.	It is the earnest desire of the Hungarian Government to see that the success achieved at Madrid will make its favourable effect felt in other regions of the world as well. Unfortunately  however  the policy of extremist circles has an adverse effect on positive endeavours throughout the world  thus hampering the efforts to eliminate the hotbeds of crisis.51.	In the present tense international situation a great role is being played by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  whose members represent the large majority of the world's countries and population. The Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March  is added proof that the non-aligned countries are actively engaged in promoting the quest for solutions to the pressing problems of our age. The further deepening of co-operation with them stands high in the foreign policy of the Hungarian People's Republic.52.	The United Nations has from the outset contributed to the formulation of principles conducive to a settlement of the Middle East crisis. Nevertheless  we have for years witnessed efforts to bypass the United Nations  to make separate deals  to keep some parties out of the search for a settlement. That explains why  more than one year after the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 516 (1982)  the Israeli occupation troops are still in Lebanon and the Palestinian Arab people continues to suffer and to be held in thrall.53.	The lack of a solution to the question of Palestine as the key element of the Middle East crisis and the rejection of proposals for a just and lasting settlement are obviously liable to lead to further aggravation of the crisis. The Hungarian Government is convinced that the situation in the region can be settled only by an international conference held with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO].54.	Recently  the anxiety felt by the forces of peace has been greatly increased by actions against the progressive countries of Central America and the Caribbean. We believe that those crises are equally impossible to solve if one thinks in terms of force and places the interests of certain Powers before everything else. A solution can only result from respect for the right of the peoples concerned to self-determination and from non-resort to interference in internal affairs  military threats  intimidation and economic and political pressure.55.	The Government and people of the Hungarian People's Republic are in solidarity with the peoples of Latin America in their struggle for national independence  self-determination and social progress as well as against oppression and neo-colonialist designs. We lend support to the common actions by the countries of that continent to achieve a negotiated settlement and to find just and peaceful solutions for the conflicts that generate tension in the region.56.	Similarly  the Hungarian People's Republic greatly appreciates the efforts by the countries of Indo-China to reduce tension in South-East Asia  and it supports the proposals formulated at the April and July conferences of their foreign ministers.57.	The Hungarian Government attaches great importance to a peaceful solution of the question of Cyprus that will accord with the interests of both communities in the island country  guarantee sovereignty and the non- aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus and rule out any intervention from without.58.	Hungary shares the indignation of international public opinion that the racist regime of South Africa continues its policy of apartheid in defiance of broad international condemnation.59.	The intensification of the activities of the neo-colonialist forces amid mounting international tension is a particularly noteworthy feature of the situation with regard to Namibia. Despite the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions setting forth the principles of a settlement  Namibia is still prevented by the strategic and economic interests of the South African regime and its external supporters from acceding to independence. Some Powers impose arbitrary conditions not sanctioned by any United Nations resolution and try to have the South West Africa People's Organization the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  pushed into the background. The Hungarian Government condemns such attempts and calls for the implementation of the United Nations plan for a settlement in accordance with the Declaration of the Paris conference on Namibia.60.	The worsening of international relations  the long- drawn-out crisis of the world economy and certain politically motivated measures exercise a steady adverse effect on nearly all areas of international economic  trading  financial and scientific-technical co-operation. This raises serious difficulties for countries which  like Hungary  have a particular interest in the international division of labour.61.	Everyone knows that the Hungarian People's Republic is a member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  an open economic community  and enjoys the security and advantages offered by the co-operation of socialist countries. At the same time  however  Hungary is also seriously interested in strengthening economic relations with all countries  whatever their social and political systems.62.	We are convinced that the disorders of international economic co-operation can be cured only by joint efforts  by expanding co-operation based on. mutual benefit and free from discrimination. We  for our part  intend to do our utmost to this effect. This pursuit is dictated by our national interests  and we think it provides the only basis for the establishment of the new and more equitable international economic order and the system of relations that are rightfully demanded by the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations.63.	The Hungarian People's Republic maintains that mutual acquaintance with one another is the best means of combating the prejudices  national hatred and isolationism that do so much damage to international relations. The Hungarian Government starts from this premise also in respect of human contacts and human rights. Socialist Hungary has nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to conceal in this field either. We do not fail to include the fundamental rights to life and work in the sphere of human rights  and we disagree with those who limit the scope of human rights. Their propagandists considerations in this area are common knowledge. But are not the quality of life and the exercise of human rights most directly affected when masses of people are deprived of the possibility of becoming useful members of their society and supporters of their families?64.	We maintain the position of principle that the international community should call attention primarily to massive and gross violations of human rights  particularly apartheid and other manifestations of unlawful discrimination on grounds of race  colour  nationality or religion. Such practices are unfortunately an everyday occurrence in a number of countries  and they are resolutely condemned by the Hungarian People's Republic.65.	The Hungarian Government believes that our efforts should be concentrated on eliminating such phenomena rather than on mounting propaganda campaigns that reduce the lofty ideals of human rights to a device for political designs alien to them.66.	The more tense the international situation  the greater the responsibility for peace borne by each and every State. The Hungarian Government  wherever its possibilities permit  assumes its share of responsibility and selects the alternative of dialogue and negotiations rather than confrontation. We hold the view that the United Nations should play an important role in this endeavour  as in the search for negotiated solutions to controversial issues. Consequently my Government takes a resolute stand in favour of strengthening the role and increasing the effectiveness of the United Nations in accordance with its Charter.67.	The Hungarian People's Republic has worked and wishes to continue working in partnership with all Governments in international co-operative efforts to strengthen peace. We are convinced that there is no disputed issue that could not be solved peacefully  by way of negotiations. We most categorically reject the option of allowing weapons to have the final word  which would be a suicidal course in our time.68.	The Hungarian People's Republic  whose foreign policy is consistent with the noble purposes and principles of the Charter  is ready to contribute its share to the efforts of the United Nations in pursuit of peace. Our delegation will be guided by this spirit in the work of the present session. "
"64",3145,"IDN",38,1983,"ï»¿215. It is indeed a great pleasure for me to address to Mr. Illiecathe felicitations of my delegation on his assumption ofthe presidency of the thirty-eighth session. His electionis deserved recognition of his many accomplishments in?the service of his Government and of the internationalcommunity. We are confident that we shall benefit fromhis wisdom and experience in our work at this session.216.	I should also like to take this opportunity to commend the previous President  Mr. Imre Hollai  on the wayhe fulfilled his many responsibilities in difficult circumstances  and to record our deep appreciation of his guidance and leadership.217.	On behalf of the Indonesian Government andpeople  I extend a warm welcome to Saint Christopherand Nevis on its accession to membership in the Organization. My delegation looks forward to close co-operationbetween our two countries.218.	This thirty-eighth session is meeting in an atmosphere of deep anxiety and frustration  as the worldcontinues to be confronted by multiple crises of unprecedented proportions and persistence. The turmoil andtension in the political sphere are matched by the stagnation and disarray that today characterize the economiesof virtually all nations  affecting most severely the developing countries. The threat of nuclear catastrophe  fedby an incessant arms race  is casting its ominous pal overall other human endeavours. Yet  instead of mountinga purposeful  global response to these challenges  theinternational community seems to be locked In a perverseinability to agree on even a common approach to theproblems.219.	We have ail come to recognize peace  disarmamentand development as the central  interrelated issues of ourtime  hut in acknowledging this reality we are in fact alsodefining the comprehensive context  which is the only?relevant content  for peacefully resolving the growinginsecurity instability in the world.220.	In the present global setting  mutual interactionand linkages between political and economic problemsare self-evident. In an increasingly interdependent world the political stability and economic well-being of bothdeveloped and developing countries are becoming moreintertwined. As the promos we face today have assumedglobal proportions  in scope as well as In their consequences  they accordingly Cali for a globalized effort infinding solutions. The emergence of a new  more equitable and rational international order can come aboutonly through sustained international co-operation anddialogue  conducted within a coherent and integratedapproach to the problems at hand.221.	It is a matter of deepening concern  therefore to observe what our Secretary-General in his reporton the work of to- Organization	so aptly described as the continuing ""erosion of multilateralism andinternationalism"".222.	The growing tendency of some major Powers toresort to a bilateralism based on considerations of expediency and a narrowly defined concept of security mustbe checked  as it earn only lead to heightened polarizationarid the revival of naked power politics. If such a driftwere allowed to continue  while inequalities and inequitiesamong nations remain unresolved  interdependence willsadly become a mere euphemism for new forms of dependence and domination. When  furthermore  each andevery conflict situation in the acid is being perceivedand east within the context of East-West rivalry  then thesolution of problems will only be further complicatedand the risk of world-wide escalation correspondinglyenlarged.223.	My Government  therefore  fully endorses the coilmade by the Secretary-General to take a fresh collectivelook at the problems we are facing  to exert renewedefforts at the highest level to strengthen international cooperation and to support the United Nations as theprincipal  collective instrument through which Governments can and should control conflicts and work outsolutions together.224.	The threat to the very survival of human civilization from nuclear war remains the greatest danger facingthe world today. The nuclear arms race  far from abating continues to escalate to the point of complete irrationality. The more money is spent on arms  the more peopleseem to be taking leave of their senses  proceeding inexorably on a path of self-destruction  spending more andmore and gaining less and less.225.	Faced with the prospect of an irreversible spiralof escalation  the Seventh Conference of Heads of Stateor Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at NewDelhi last March  has called for priority action on a freezeon the production and deployment of nuclear weapons the speedy finalization of a comprehensive test-ban treatyand a treaty banning chemical weapons  as well as foraction to ensure that outer space is used exclusively forpeaceful purposes. The heads of State or Government ofNon-Aligned Countries also reaffirmed the importanceof establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basisof arrangements freely arrived at among the Stash. I of theregions concerned.226.	For its part  Indonesia has always emphasized thevalidity and relevance of the regional approach to securityand disarmament. The States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations	have long advocated a zoneof peace  freedom and neutrality within which there isprovision for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-freezone in South-East Asia. In that part of the world ASEAN has built an edifice for co-operation and progressamong regional States which to date has proved not onlyits utility out  more importantly  its durability. The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South-EastAsia  as a component element of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  would be a logical and meaningfulcontribution to regional peace and stability.227.	In a climate of growing distrust and heightenedtensions between the super-Powers  conflicts have become increasingly more difficult to resolve.It is to be regretted  therefore  that the shocking incidentinvolving the shooting down of the South Korean civilianairliner on Me September 1983 has further exacerbated thisclimate of tension and mutual suspicion. Indonesia welcomes the recent decision on this matter taken by the Council  which is the appropriate forum to conduct a thorough investigation and to ensure that tragediesof this kind do not occur in the future.228.	In South-East Asia  peace and regional harmonycontinue to elude us because of the unresolved probateof Kampuchea. Central to this problem is the questionof how to secure the restoration of national independenceand sovereignty for the Kampuchean people and  indeed how to secure their very survival as a nation. As long asforeign forces remain in that country  as long as theKampuchean people arc denied the right to determinetheir own future and to pursue their own political andeconomic system  free from external interference  no justand durable solution can be found to this problem.229.	We are encouraged to note that the CoalitionGovernment of Democratic Kampuchea has been gainingwidening support  inside Kampuchea as wet as abroad.230.	My Government reiterates its firm belief that it isin the interest of all parties concerned to seek a comprehensive political solution through negotiation rather thanconfrontation. We remain convinced that the elementscontained in the Declaration on Kampuchea providethe best framework for such a solution. They offer anequitable approach to ensure the re-emergence of Kampuchea as an Independent  sovereign and non-alignednation. That Declaration also takes fairy into account thelegitimate interests and security concerns of ail countriesin South-East Asia including Viet Nam.231.	 should take to stress that what Indonesia and theother member countries of ASEAN aspire to is not asolution beyond the attainable  given the often-expresseddesire of all States in the region for peace  stability andmutual co-operation in South-East Asia. But it must bebased on the premise of the withdrawal of all foreigntroops from Kampuchean soil and the establishment ofa Kampuchean government of the people's own choosing through internationally supervised elections In which allKampucheans will participate  for only then can thevarious political groups in Kampuchea actively worktowards the goal of national reconciliation.232.	Yet another issue which begs for a speedy politicalsolution based on the withdrawal of foreign forces is thesituation In Afghanistan. In addition to endangering thepeace and security of South-West Asia  this conflict hasjustifiably aroused world-wide concern because of itsramifications on a number of global issues. The sovereignty  territorial integrity  independence and non-alignedstatus of the country must be restored and the Afghanrefugees must be allowed to return to their homes Insafety and dignity. 1 would like to take this opportunity to commend the efforts of the Secretary-General tofind a negotiated solution  and we are encouraged bythe indications of progress so far made by his specierepresentative.233.	The search for a just peace in the Middle Eastrevolves around the questions that remain at the core ofthe protracted conflict in that region: self-determinationand sovereign nationhood for the Palestine people andthe cessation of Israeli aggression and illegal occupationof ail Arab territory  including Jerusalem. Developmentsin this seed-bed of turbulence nave followed an unchanging pattern of movement from one violent crisis to theUnited Nations. From proclaiming Jerusalem as its capital to the annexation of the Golan Heights  by the furtherestablishment of illegal settlements in the occupied territories and the continued oppression and violation of thehuman rights of the Arab people in those territories Israeli policies have been title root cause of aggravatedtensions  making any meaningful progress towards solution exceedingly difficult. Ironically  these policies havebrought neither peace nor greater security for Israel.Indonesia has consistent; supported all Arab initiatives including the proposals of the Twelfth Arab SummitConference  tied at Fez  as they provide a sound basisfor the search for a just and durable peace in the region.Indonesia remains steadfast in its support of the FLO the soy and legitimate representative of the Palestinianpeople.	 234.	The International Conference on this Question ofPalestine  just had at Geneva  was a historic gatheringof the international community which underscores theurgency and concern we all attach to securing the rightsof title Palestinian people. The decisions of the Conference  in the view of my delegation  contain the key ferments for a peaceful solution to the question of Palestine.Most importantly  it called upon the Security Council toadopt effective measures to establish an independent andsovereign Palestinian State white assuring the right of allStates to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries. In this regard  the Council was invitedto convene an international peace conference on theMiddle East  with alt parties  tincturing the PLO and thebig Powers  as wet as other concerned States  participating on an equal footing. Our task is to secure this goalthrough a process of negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement.235.	Israelâs massive invasion of Lebanon test yearshocked the world and underscored the impunity withwhich Israel has tried to impose its designs on the region?in complete disregard of world censure. A year after theinvasion  Israeli forces continue to occupy large areas ofLebanon  and the situation is further aggravated by theinvolvement of more extra-regional States. My delegationmaintains that the key to the preservation of the territorialintegrity and independence of Lebanon is to secure theimmediate and tactic withdraws of ate Israeli forces andthe scrupulous observance of non-interference by alloutside Powers. This would greatly facilitate efforts Inencouraging all contending Lebanese factions towardsnegotiations leading to national reconciliation. We therefore welcome the recent cease-fire as a positive step inthis direction.236.	The plight of Namibia continues to be an affrontto our sense of justice and a hearty burden on the collective conscience of the international community. How longshould we bear witness to the pain and suffering of?millions who are fighting for human dignity and sodajustice Indeed  how long can we remain patient  year?after year  la the face of Pretoria's ruthless perpetuationof its twin policies of occupation in Namibia andapartheid in South Africa237.	Despite concerted International efforts  most reentity at the International Conference in Support of theStruggle of the Namibian People for independence  heldin Pans from 25 to 29 April 1983. the prospects of a freeand independent Namibia seem no better today that theydid its spring. Most significantly  the further report ofthe Secretary-General on Ms recent visit to the region'has shown that the stalemate continues because of Pretoria' insistence at Making progress towards Namibiaindependence to extraneous issues such as Se pretenceof Cuban troops in Angola. The racist regime also persistsin efforts to perpetuate its integral occupation of Namibiathrough a calculated potties of social and political fragmentation and imposing puppet regimes. As the Secretary General pointed out  unit a date is fixed for theimplementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978and a cease-fire comes into force  the calm of substantialprogress cannot be sustained. Against this background it would be naive to entertain the hope that South Africanracists will ever abandon their policies and abide by theterms of relevant Security Council resolutions without theimposition of mandatory sanctions. In South Africa  the odious policy of apartheid continues to be pursued. In the face ofincreased repression by the regime  the people have intensified their resistance. This was demonstrated by lastmonth's protest meeting in Cape Town  the largest heldin South Africa in over two decades.It is dear that South Africa's protects of internaloppression and external aggression have reached such amagnitude as to pica international peace and securityin imminent jeopardy. The front-line States have bornethe brunt of South Africa's repeated armed aggressionsand attempts at military  political and economic destabilization. Such continuing threats must beaddressed by the Security Council  which has the authority and responsibility to compel South Africa's compliance with its obligations under the Charter of the UnitedNations.241.	All too often the cessation of armed hostilities hasled to a slackening of efforts to achieve peaceful settlement of a dispute. New efforts should be exerted to resume negotiations  as procrastination can only idea to a prolongation of the dispute or even to a resumption of armedhostilities.242.	Within the same area of the world  we continueto view with concern the tensions and strife that havebeset Central America and the Caribbean. The factorsthat have embroiled this region in incessant turmoil arefundamentally rooted in internal  unresolved promswomen in the past thwarted movement towards social andeconomic justice as well as growth towards true independence. Movement toward the solution of these problemsis hampered by externally induced overt or covert pressures. The most rational approach has come from theStats in the region themselves  which ultimately have thegreatest stake in re-establishing stability in the region.24. it is in this context that my Government supportsthe Contadina Group's initiative. The Group's understanding of the unique historical circumstances and itscomprehensive regional approach fully deserve seriousattention. In addition  my delegation hopes that theexiting regional organizations wimp also pays a greaterreef in building a vibe: infrastructure for economicco-operation  political cohesion and overall stability.245.	We are aware that the parries to the 1959 AntarcticTreaty has promoted scientific co-operation and environmental research and has succeeded in preventingterritorial claims at the militarization of the region.None the is  all of these commendable activities do notdetract from the fact that knowledge about the workingsof the Treaty and the modalities of its functioning haveso far been the privilege of a few. Hence  the initiativeof Malaysia and Antigua at Barbuda in asking the United Nations to undertake acomprehensive study of the region is a commendable one which my dedication fully supports. It is also in tune withthe decision taken at New Delhi by the Seventh Confer-once of Heads of State or Government of Non-AlignedCountries 246.	Indonesia does not share the apprehension of theTreaty's signatories that such a study would in any wayundermine what it has already achieved. Indeed  weshould air ensure that such an examination will contribute?to increasing the informed interest at participation ofthe international community in the development of thepotential of Antarctica  without undermining the legalregime already in force.247.	In reviewing the global economic situation andinternational economic relations  we cannot disguise ourexasperation at the protracted malaise that continues toafflict them. The economic crisis which has tons sincereached global proportions is threatening the stability andstiffing the growth of all countries. Consequently  theeconomic resilience and margin of safety once availabletoo many developing countries have been severely eroded.Their vulnerable economies  left exposed to the relentlessonslaughts of this extremely induced -.rises  have sustaineda most damaging impact.248.	The harsh realities besetting the world economicscene today  compounded by factors  are in truthsymptomatic of more fundamental inadequacies plaguingthe international economic order. In the last decade  sincethe sixth special session of the General Assembly  in 1974 many initiatives were taken and numerous conferencesand meetings were held in vain attempts to redress thesestructural imbalances. The failure of these efforts to begin the democratization of the international economic orderdoes not negate their validity  nor should it diminish ourcommitment to their eventual achievement. Indonesia for its part  reiterates its strong commitment to the establishment of the new international economic order. Wecannot settee for is. We want equitable participation inthe productive and decision-making processes of theglobal economy.249.	What then should be our response to this mum pie?crises Some industrialized counties have responded ofinaugurating recovery policies which are rooted in the so-called trickier-down theory of economics. Such policiesare tantamount to relegating the development of thedev. eloping countries to being a mere by-product of theeconomic revival of the North. But can recovery policiesbased On such exchange be sustained against theworld economic recovery.  These fundamental  questions pose a challenge to the collective will of the international community.Prominent among these measures is theproposal to convene an international conference onmoney and finance for development  to which Indonesiafairy subscribes.251. Concurrently  decisive action should be takeneffectively to launch global negotiations. At New Dei hia two-phased approach was broached; those issues concerning connotation and allocation on which agreementhas been reached will be taken up in the first phase ofthe negotiations and those issues affecting the structureof the international economic system and its institutionswill be discussed in title second phase. This flexible approach demands a corresponding constructive responsefrom the developed countries  in a spirit of mutual interest at interdependence  we therefore strongly cat uponour partners to attach the global negotiations withoutdelay.252.	The outcome of the sixth session of the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development has beendeeply disappointing. A golden opportunity was indeedmissed. Far from responding adequately to the gravityof the world economic situation  the developed countriesat the Conference failed to demonstrate flexibilitycorresponding to that displayed by the developing countries. Moreover  the failure of the Conference to achieveany meaningful progress could set a damaging precedentresulting in the erosion of multilateral co-operation. Thatis not to say that we completely denigrate the results ofthe Conference. We can agree with the assessment of theSecretary-General that it did yield some positive elements which could form a basis for further dialogue andnegotiations.253.	Collective self-reliance of the developing countries as expressed through economic and technical co-operationamong them  Is a dynamic process? Such a process shouldnot only prove critical for revitalizing the developmentof their economies but should also greatly contribute toa sustained global recovery. Since its inception at Bandung in 1955  and as amplified in Algiers  Caracas andBuenos Aires  South-South co-operation has made commendable progress. Economic and technical co-operationamong developing countries has become an integral partof Indonesia's foreign policy. Within our limited capacities we have extended technical co-operation programmesto various countries both within and beyond our region.This we will continue.254.	The 1980s  so far  have brought au a distressing increase in political tensions  conflict and economicdislocation on a global as well as a regional scale. Thisturn for the worse has been accompanied by a corresponding aggravation of mutual suspicions  divisions andpolarization among nations and a continuing incapacityof the international community to develop the necessaryconcepts  policies and institutions capable of meeting thenew realities of our time. Conversely  however  the inexorable trend towards the greater independence of nationsand of solutions to problems has also strengthened agrowing consciousness of the common fate and commonfuture that all humankind shares in this  our one-worldcommunity.255.	Great adversity and crisis always pose a threat  butthey also offer an opportunity to effect fundamentalchange. So even though it may be tempting to lapse intocynical resignation or pessimism  the compelling need isto rise to the challenge and to arrest and reverse the slideinto uncontrollable and unmanageable chaos and thecollapse of the present in order. 256.	The presence here in New York of a large numberof heads of State or Government  in response to theinitiative of the chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi  notonly serves to bolster our unwavering support for theUnited Nations; the informal meetings which have beenheld among these world leaders  in a spirit of sincerityand good faith  have also provided a unique focal pointwhere at least the beginnings of a concerted global approach to the problems of peace and peaceful coexistence disarmament and development can be fashioned.257.	If this should be the ease  then 1983 could yet turnout to be  in the words of the Secretary-General  a yearof reassessment and a turning point. "
"65",3192,"IND",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	  I congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to that august office. Your long association with the United Nations and your experience give us hope that during your tenure the Organization will gain strength. We are glad also to see the Secretary-General by your side. His analysis of the current world situation deserves serious reflection. We wish success to his patient and untiring labour in the cause of world peace.2.	I welcome our newest Member  St. Kitts-Nevis.3.	I am here on a quest of peace and co-operation. I have the privilege of addressing the Assembly not only on behalf of the people of India  one of the founder Members of the United Nations  but also on behalf of 100 other members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which met at New Delhi in March at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries and renewed their pledge to work for a world which would not be driven by distrust and hatred and for a truly international community where nations would grasp hands of friendship across geographical frontiers.4.	For the last 20 years the non-aligned have customarily met once in three years  and the Chairperson has reported to the United Nations. Firm faith in the United Nations is central to the non-aligned. All members of the Non- Aligned Movement are Members  current or potential  of the United Nations. However  the United Nations is an institution  the non-aligned group a movement. The United Nations is  or ought to be  a forum for solving disputes; the Non-Aligned Movement eschews discussion of bilateral problems. But the aim is the same: to maintain peace by removing the sources of tension and to bring out the humanity in human beings.5.	At the New Delhi Conference we adopted a comprehensive statement on the economic and political state of the world. Our views were summed up in what has now come to be called the New Delhi Message. The final paragraph says:""The crisis which confronts our civilization today is unprecedented in history. Great tasks call for wise decisions. We appeal to the great Powers to give up mistrust  engage in sincere  forward-looking negotiations in a spirit of shared good faith to reach agreement on various disarmament measures and to find a way out of the deepening economic crisis which threatens all of us. United  the members of the Non-Aligned Movement are prepared to do everything in their power to assist in this process. The earth belongs to us all- let us cherish it in peace and true brotherhood  based on the dignity and equality of man."" I am here to give this message to the entire world.6.	When the non-aligned plead with the aligned to give up confrontation and conflict  it is not out of any presumption. We are only too keenly aware of our own weaknesses  of the unnecessary discords and disputes between ourselves. But  being militarily weak  we do not have to find justification for strength. We are familiar with pain and suffering  we do not want them to increase anywhere. Our plea for peace is not out of superior virtue but because peace is indispensable  because humankind now has the choice  the knowledge and the power to prevent the calamity of extinction.7.	Scientists  scholars and some notable soldiers have vividly described the outcome of a future nuclear war. Imagine a hundred or a thousand Hiroshima at one time. Imagine a world with nowhere to hide and perhaps nobody left to hide. As more and more people in all countries comprehend the full implications of the monstrous stockpiles of nuclear death  peace movements grow in number and beyond political ideology  driven by peoples' inmost urge to live. We can all live only if we all combine in the struggle for peace.8.	Some quarters believe that nuclear armaments can be controlled  and deployed with exact calculation of cost- effectiveness. Equally frightening is the preparation and willingness to use other deadly chemical  biological and other such devices. Even more disturbing is the talk in depersonalised terms of using outer space for future wars.9.	This relentless search for ever increasingly barbaric weapons systems is undertaken in the name of security. India and other non-aligned countries are convinced that only general and complete disarmament can provide real and enduring security. Nuclear-weapon Powers owe it to humanity to renounce the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in any situation whatever. As a first step they should resume negotiations for disarmament and ban the production and testing of all nuclear weapons.10.	In four days we shall celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's one hundred and fourteenth birthday. There is renewed awareness of the continued relevance of his message of non-violence and tolerance. He said:""Man as animal is violent  but as spirit is non-violent. The moment he awakes to the spirit within he cannot remain violent. Either he progresses towards non-violence or rushes to his doom. That is why the prophets and avatars have taught the lessons of truth  harmony  brotherhood  justiceâall attributes of nonviolence.""11.	The other major theme of the non-aligned is development. We are largely poor and technologically backward. Even the handful of the rich amongst us are not technologically self-reliant. Most of us have become free from colonial rule only in the last 35 years. Our national freedom is new; our national unities need to be consolidated. Freedom itself releases long-pent-up hopes and yearning for rights. In this age of instant globe-encircling information technology  the media dazzle eyes and fill ears with images and reports of affluence. Even the modest expectations of our peoples are far beyond our present means. Besides  we are hard put to preserve our independence because of the many economic  political and military pressures.12.	The present world economic order is based on domination and inequality. The basic aim of the programmes of action drawn up at New Delhi was to strengthen the economies of weak nations. We outlined a mechanism to pool our own technological resources  a South-South dialogue as a supplement to the North- South one. We also indicated some immediate measures  the most important of which was the convening of a conference on money and finance for development. To help developing countries is not mere largesse. It will directly benefit the industrialized because development in Asia  Africa and Latin America  and the enlargement of their incomes by removing obstacles to their export  will absorb industrial goods and machinery from advanced countries  stimulate economic activity and ease their unemployment problem. What better investment can the North make in its own future than by turning today's deprived of the South into tomorrow's consumers?13.	Existing international institutions and those who have headed them have done valuable work  but these bodies are not wholly representative  nor do they reflect the changes that have occurred in the international economy. No country or set of countries is without dilemmas. The affluent ones which follow market economies have problems of production  unemployment and currency instability. Industrialized countries with planned economies  which do not formally belong to the international monetary system but participate in the global activities of commerce and technological exchange  also face problems of production and renovation. We the developing are caught between the inadequacies of internal and external resources. All these are parts of one global crisis. There is no way out except through dialogue among us all. Each country  however powerful  has more to gain by accommodation and co-operation than by withdrawal into individual isolation or adoption of policies to maintain the solidarity of the strong. That is why we advocate a new international economic order based on equality and justice. Unfortunately  over the past three years the procedural hurdles to the launching of global negotiations have not been overcome.14.	The advanced countries have held consultations regarding their own problems and the accumulated burdens of the economically weakest. Nothing concrete has emerged. Intentions are offset by supposed domestic compulsions. The Summit of Industrialized Nations at Williamsburg in May and the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in June and July have shown up once again the fear of the unfamiliar  of lowering easy  safe  existing protective barriers and releasing restrictive rules. Why should these countries be afraid of the demands of the weak? It is time for bolder moves in trade and in financial and technological cooperation and a daring new initiative to eliminate global poverty by the end of the century. The demand of the developing countries for a North-South dialogue is all too often seen as yet another plea of the have-nots which has to be resisted by the haves. The world today is too complex for such a simplistic division. Political independence is not an end to problems  but only a recognition of the realities of governance in adverse circumstances.15.	Ideas and initiatives come through discussion  through collective counsel. At New Delhi the non-aligned felt the universal need for further communication and more informal discussions with one another  hence the suggestion that the current session of the General Assembly could be an occasion for heads of State or Government leaders of the developing and the developed countries  the non-aligned and the aligned  the North and South  West and East of common parlance  to be together for just a few days to think and talk about the great problems of peace and security  disarmament and development. We expect no dramatic results  but the immensity of our challenges calls for persistence. Every attempt may take us just a little further in promoting a climate of peace.16.	It is gracious indeed of so many heads of State and Government to listen to this call of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries. We are having informal meetings individually and collectively  joined by the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General. Could 1983 mark a watershed in the history of the United Nations? This great world body was founded as a group of nations united in a wartime alliance. With the entry of newly freed countries  the end of the decade saw its expansion into a much bigger body. The next 30 years have brought about near universality in its composition. Today  because of the unique authority entrusted to it in controlling military crises through its instruments and its influence on social and economic developments through its various specialized agencies  the United Nations is an integral part of the lives of nations and individuals. It has not yet come near the beginnings of a global approach. Its progress has to be halting and tentative  sometimes unavoidably ineffectual in facing up to immediate problems  because of the very nature of its origin and institutional structure  particularly the ideological divide  which was not envisaged by those who drew up the Charter. It is our task to improve this institution to make it capable of facing difficulties which were not foreseen 40 years ago.17.	Some issues arouse intense feeling in individual nations  others our common indignation. One such is the persistence of racialism. How can the denial of freedom to the majority of the people of South Africa and the people of Namibia be condoned? I affirm our total support for the freedom struggle of the people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SPK4PO]  and to the Governments and peoples of the front-line States  which have to endure pressure and provocation. Almost my own first conscious thoughts were admiration for those who fought for freedom and concern for those who suffered. Nelson Mandela  a flaming symbol of freedom  and many others are behind prison bars  but their voices cannot be stilled; they resound the world over.18.	The turmoil in West Asia remains the most serious threat to peace. Driven from their homes  the Palestinian people are in physical and mental agony. We support the valiant efforts of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] to secure their legitimate rights. The occupation of the land of others will not guarantee Israel's security. The Palestinians must be masters in their home  and all States of the region should live within secure international frontiers. The voice of the non-aligned spoke out firmly at the New Delhi summit for a peaceful settlement which ensures justice. This call was endorsed and reaffirmed by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva in August and September. All parties concerned should begin the process of reconciliation.19.	The sufferings of the people of Lebanon  caused by the intervention of foreign forces  have been of great concern to all of us. Here again  the Israeli aggression triggered the crisis. We are relieved to learn of the ceasefire  which we hope will be maintained. All foreign forces should be withdrawn and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon should be respected by all.20.	The crisis in Central America must be urgently defused. We should demand and support efforts to create a climate of negotiation without external interference. India and the other non-aligned countries have welcomed the peace initiatives of the Contadora Group.21.	The non-aligned have always stood for non-interference and non-use of force. The complex situation in Afghanistan can be solved only on the basis of these twin principles. We fully support the representative of the Secretary-General in working for a solution which takes into consideration the concerns of all the involved parties. The tragic and wasteful Iraq-Iran war harms both countries. Conflicts in other regions also  including Kampuchea  admit only of political solutions.22.	Militarily  today's leading countries are incomparably more powerful than in the days when a single gunboat could silence and immobilize millions. The weak are not so weak  nor the strong so strong. The essence of the concept of non-alignment is peaceful coexistence and the promotion of constructive co-operation. The ""non"" in non-alignment relates to the importance of resisting attitudes of irreconcilable hostility. The positive aspects are the desire for friendship with other nations irrespective of patterns of governmentâwhich are their own business âand to strengthen the fabric of our own nations.23.	In India we work for self-reliance in action and self- respect in thought  which Bertrand Russell called ""the better half of pride"". But this pride is for human achievement and human potential. Its justification would be our ability to discern the future beyond the gloom of the present.24.	The safety of the weak is the strength of the strong. That is why the weakest and the poorest amongst us  within each society and in the international community  must be shielded from the inclemencies of the international climate. Continued disparities also aggravate political tensions and lead to instability. The strong  with the help of the rest of the international community  can think of measures to contain the enormous destructive potential which gives them illusions of strength but whose very power is troublesome. It is a welcome sign that the two most powerful nations are engaged in negotiations on vital strategic matters and have not allowed even serious incidents to deflect them. The myriad other problems concerning the environment  the optimum utilization of the resources of our planet and the reorganization of political and economic systems at the global and State levels need our co-operative endeavours.25.	The Industrial Revolution gave a major turn to history. Out of it emerged industrial capitalism and  as a reaction to it  Marxism in its various forms. Together these have given rise to the great social upheavals of our time. The two have followed different paths but their ethos is basically materialistic. All that begins must end. And the seeds of the ending are present from the very beginning. What we have witnessedâthe two world wars  the possible approach of a third  so much more destructive and disastrous  and the struggle for powerâare the end of the road for the existing order of competing systems. Out of this chaos a new order is struggling to be born. This is our last chance of appealing to the old and entrenched not to infect the new with its diseases: neocolonialism  monopoly  economic oppression  class divisions and big-Power politics  as well as the idea that power is invincible and can feed on itself  with militarization as the ultimate tool.26.	For us  the non-aligned  and for all who are deeply concerned with the future of humanity  the question is whether we help the birth of this new creation or throttle it before it can draw breath. The matter is not simple  because history has proved time and again that ideas and movements can be obstructed  but not stopped. How long can a few pockets of affluence continue to exert influence on the large populations  the natural resources  the cultural strength of the others? How long can allies and supporters  who may not have a base in their own countries and who are not in tune with the changing times  be perpetuated? You cannot kill an idea by killing its adherents. The newborn will not die; the birth can be delayed but the cost will be much higher and the affluent will have to pay. When peaceful change is thwarted  violent upheaval occurs. Previously  the end of a civilization brought destruction and trauma in its trail. If we keep to past trends  we too will be engulfed by circumstances. But today we have the opportunity  which may well be the first in human history  for humankind to bridge the transition from the old to the new in a conscious way  to build a new era  to move together to a new future.27.	The barriers which have been put up to shut out the new are the different faces of colonialismâeconomic  technological and the powerful weapons of food and information. These are the walls at which we raise our voices. That is why we lay stress on a new economic order  a new information order  preserving cultural identities. Walls do not move and can be got around.28.	Vast knowledge and technological advances concentrated in the hands of a few can lead to a new type of oppression  the barbarity inherent in technological excellence when it is monopolized by the powerful and used for their ends. What just a few years ago were considered as interesting fantasies are today perilously close to the facts of contemporary living. Brainwashing is not confined to any one system or one part of the world  to say nothing of the other cruelties of deprivation.29.	The shape of this new order is not clear. What form the future will take is being moulded right now by our actions. When I speak of the new order  I am not talking merely of more effective and more widespread use of technology  however dramatic it may be  of which we read so much and about which there are many prognoses. I speak of entirely different thought processes and emotional reactions m the use of technology. We must imbue technology with deeper understanding of the difficulties of others and ensure protection against any further technological colonialism. The new order cannot be confined to the economic or social or cultural. It must encompass all of these and yet be much larger. We must create a new international order of humanity  where power is tempered with compassion  where knowledge and capability are at the service of all humanity. "
"66",3238,"IRL",38,1983,"ï»¿48. Mr. President  I wish to join in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. Your wide experience of international affairs and of the United Nations in particular makes you especially qualified to guide the Assembly in its deliberations.49.	I should also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the efficient manner in which he presided over the last session.50.	I should also like to extend a warm welcome to our newest Member State  Saint Christopher and Nevis.51.	The United Nations was founded almost 40 years ago to maintain international peace and security  to develop friendly relations among nations  to foster economic and social progress and to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Born out of the most destructive war in human history  it represented a second attempt in this century to impose order and stability on the essential anarchy of inter-State relations. For the peoples of our fragile planet who had suffered greatly in two world wars and numerous other conflicts during the previous 50 years  the United Nations offered a hope that at last mankind had found a method of collective security which would replace conflict with co-operation  which would substitute negotiations for the use of force  which would defend the weak and deter aggression.52.	How has the Organization fared? Has it met the high hopes of its founders and the high expectations of our peoples?53.	The record gives little cause for satisfaction. Look at the facts.54.	Over 65 major wars have been fought in the past 20 years  with a total loss of life in excess of ten million people.55.	At present  over 40 major and minor armed conflicts are in progress. The loss of life  the injuries and the destruction in the past weeks in Lebanon are the most recent and dramatic reminder of man's barbarism and his innate capacity for violence.56.	World military expenditure  already at record levels  is increasing at a rate of four per cent each year. Put more concretely  over $1 million are expended world-wide every minute for military purposes.57.	One quarter of all spending on research and development is in the military sector. Thus by a strange perversion of values is man's distinctive geniusâhis capacity for scientific thought and technological progressâdirected towards destructive rather than constructive ends.58.	The world stockpile of nuclear weapons exceeds 50 000  and unless present trends can be reversed through serious negotiation and agreement on arms control and disarmament  it seems set to increase even further.59.	Basic human rights continue to be disregarded and fundamental freedoms continue to be denied in many countries throughout the world.60.	Over one billion people  a quarter of the population of our planet  live in conditions of extreme poverty and must suffer hunger  malnutrition and ill health.61.	Even this brief extract from the catalogue of human folly discloses a frightening weakness in the international political system and reveals a trend which  if left unchecked  could vitiate the concept of collective security which lies at the heart of the Charter of the United Nations. States seem to be less willing to accept the rule of international law and to seek a resolution of their disputes by peaceful means. Instead  they are turning once more to ideas of military superiority  rearmament  the threat of force or the actual use of force to promote their national interests  to vindicate their rights or to seek unilateral advantage.62.	We know where such ideas can lead. Surely that knowledge  gained at the expense of so much suffering over the past 80 years  should strengthen our resolve not to repeat the tragic errors of the early and middle years of this century. Moreover  we know that the death and destruction which would result from similar errors now would be far in excess of anything mankind has ever experienced  for we know that there exist sufficient nuclear weapons to bring about the end of life on our planet. There can be no winner in a nuclear war.63.	This knowledge  which is the fruit of historical experience and scientific enquiry  imposes a singular responsibility on the present generation of international leaders. It also imposes an awesome task on this Organization  In a world in which some States possess the power to destroy life completely and in which local or regional disputes threaten to escalate into confrontation between the super-Powers there is an evident need for a universal organization with a code for the conduct of inter-State relations and a forum for the resolution of conflict.64.	The United Nations possesses these characteristics. Why then has it apparently failed to halt the deterioration of the fabric of international life? The answer to this question is complex. Nevertheless  one point is clear: the failure lies neither in the conceptual basis nor the institutional framework of the Organization. The principles and purposes of the Charter remain as valid now as they were 40 years ago  and the mechanisms provided by the Charter and developed by the United Nations in the intervening years remain capable  if used  of achieving their primary objective of preventing aggression and stopping wars. Moreover  the Organization has produced an abundance of ideas  analyses and detailed plans to help resolve the major political and economic problems of our time. Indeed  the Secretary-General in his reports has set out a series of measures designed to reconstruct the Charter concept of collective action for peace and security and thus render the United Nations more capable of discharging its primary function. From the outset Ireland welcomed and supported these proposals  but frankly we must admit disappointment at the lack of real progress in implementing them over the past year.65.	However imaginative  clear-sighted and courageous the Secretary-General's prescriptions are  something more is needed if the United Nations is to help heal the ills of contemporary international life. A necessary condition for the success of the Organization is a will and a capacity on the part of the major Powers  in particular those Powers that are assigned special rights and primary responsibilities under the Charter  to co-operate. By the same token  the inability of these same Powers to work together is all too often sufficient to prevent the United Nations from fulfilling its primary functions.66.	The President of the United States of America  speaking from this rostrum a week ago  stated the truth about the present condition of the Organization simply and eloquently when he suggested that the reason why the United Nations had fallen short of the aspirations of its founders was because  as President Reagan put it  ""Governments got in the way of the dreams of the people. Dreams became issues of East versus West"". If this is the case  and I believe it is so  then certain conclusions can be drawn about the future of the United Nations and its capacity to discharge its most basic responsibility to the peoples  in the words of the Preamble to the Charter  to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"".67.	First  a fundamental prerequisite for the effective functioning of the Organization is co-operation between the major Powers. This was true in 1945 when the United Nations was born out of the wartime alliance of the great Powers; it is equally true today. From this it follows that a major requirement for an improvement in the effectiveness of the United Nations is an improvement in relations between the super-Powers. It must be plainly said that there is an overriding and an urgent need for the United States and the Soviet Union to halt the deterioration in their political relationship and to replace the current mood of challenge and confrontation by a process of dialogue leading to agreement. In this connection  a well-prepared summit meeting between the leaders of the two most powerful nations on Earth could set in motion such a process. The detente process of the 1960s and early 1970s  despite its shortcomings  showed what could be achieved when East and West acknowledged their mutual interdependence and their common interest in preserving world peace.68.	A second requirement  linked to the first  is early progress in the strategic arms reduction talks and intermediate-range nuclear force negotiations. Reductions in strategic and intermediate-range nuclear weapons are clearly indispensable. But the success of these negotiations would  I believe  also have a positive impact on other arms control and disarmament negotiations in which there has been scant progress in recent years  in particular those under way in the United Nations framework on such issues as a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty and a treaty on chemical weapons. Comprehensive negotiations should also begin urgently to prevent the extension of military competition into yet another arena through the militarization of outer space.69.	Thirdly  we need active super-Power co-operation in resolving regional disputes which  although indigenous in origin  have acquired an East-West dimension. It would be wrong to suggest that contemporary tensions between East and West are responsible for disputes many of which have roots deep in local and regional history  in conflicts of rights  in territorial claims  in historic animosities  in religious and racial hatreds  in economic and social injustice. None the less  it is evident that the political and military support which the super-Powers and their allies may lend to one side or another can exacerbate local and regional rivalries  sustain them and complicate the process of their peaceful resolution. Moreover  the involvement of outside Powers  particularly the major Powers  in such disputes not only has a destabilizing effect on international relations generally but also holds the danger that a regional dispute may escalate into a wider international conflict. In such conditions there is a clear necessity for the major Powers to work towards the peaceful resolution of regional disputes  to resist the temptation to exploit them for strategic gain and to co-operate in using the peace-making and peace-keeping machinery available to the Security Council.70.	I believe these steps could help repair some of the recent damage to the fabric of international life and restore some confidence in the international system of which the United Nations is a central part. But the responsibility in this regard does not lie solely with the major Powers. There is a concomitant need for the other Members of the United Nations to use the framework  structures and procedures offered by the Organization to resolve the conflicts and disputes which form a large part of the Assembly's agenda.71.	One of the practical instruments which the United Nations has successfully evolved is the deployment of peace-keeping forces and observers. Ireland attaches great importance to these functions  and we have contributed to many such operations over the years. We see these operations as a practical way in which Member States  even the smallest  can contribute effectively to the collective task of peace-keeping and peace-making.72.	Over the coming months the General Assembly will debate a comprehensive agenda of issues of concern to the international community. The views of the 10 members of the European Community  to which Ireland belongs  have already been stated in this debate by the Foreign Minister of Greece. I should like in this national statement to set out more fully the position of the Irish Government on some of the more important issues before us.73.	Confidence in relations between States was badly shaken recently when the air force of the Soviet Union shot down an unarmed civilian airliner with great loss of life. This callous act and the attitude subsequently adopted by the Soviet authorities in seeking to justify it called forth widespread anger and condemnation. The fate of the Korean airliner and its passengers has highlighted the need to devise means which will guarantee the safety of international civil aviation and help avert a repetition of this shameful episode. I welcome the endorsement this weekend by the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization of the decision taken earlier by that agency's Council in this regard.74.	One consequence of the Korean airliner disasterâ which underlines the political significance of this incident and its aftermathâis the absence from the General Assembly of Foreign Minister Gromyko. This absence is regrettable; but it may serve to emphasize something which I stressed at the outset of my addressâthe indispensable function of dialogue between the super-Powers. Political dialogue at the highest levels can play a vital part in facilitating progress and breaking stalemates in diplomatic relations.75.	I have already mentioned the crucial arms control and disarmament negotiations taking place at Geneva. The vast majority of the States present here  including my own  are not involved directly or indirectly in these negotiations  but no Member State can be indifferent to their outcome. The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  has said that the prevention of nuclear war is the unique challenge of our time. He has pointed out that the key to the solution of this vital problem is in the hands of the two major nuclear Powers. We share the Secretary-General's concern at the failure so far to achieve substantial progress in the bilateral negotiations at Geneva. We would also emphasize the need for renewed determination on the part of both sides to move these talks forward.76.	The facts about the relentless growth of military expenditure and of nuclear stockpiles are well known. I have listed some of the statistics already. But the knowledge of these facts and concern about their implications are not confined just to Governments and military experts. Increasingly  all around the world  ordinary people  and especially young people  are aware of the extent to which Governments get in the way of their dreams. But more than that  they are demanding that Governments should work and be seen to work to translate the most basic dream of all into reality. Peace and the hope for a secure future for this and succeeding generations are at once the most legitimate aspiration of all peoples and the most important duty of those of us who exercise the responsibilities of Government.77.	How can Governments work to realize these dreams? I have already mentioned the importance of agreement in regard to nuclear and conventional weapons. But even if negotiations should lead to significant reductions in weaponry  the doubts and insecurity felt by public opinion around the world will not be removed unless the major Powers demonstrate in their defence programmes and in their strategic planning that they regard the quest for nuclear superiority as a dangerous illusionâthe most foolish dream of all.78.	Even as we speak today conflicts in the Middle East continue. The conflict between Israel  the Arab States and the Palestinian people affects the lives of millions of people in Israel  in the occupied territories  in Lebanon and elsewhere  and the war between Iran and Iraq is now entering its fourth year with no solution in sight.79.	My Government is deeply concerned at the deterioration over the last year of the situation in Lebanon and especially at the great loss of life among the civilian population there. We must therefore voice the hope that the cease-fire will be consolidated so as to allow the Lebanese people to work towards national reconciliation. We also appeal to all foreign Powers in Lebanon  except those who are there with the consent of the Lebanese Government  to leave and to respect the territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of Lebanon.80.	The international community  through the United Nations  has been contributing since 1978 to the effort to bring about the withdrawal of Israeli forces from that country and to help to restore the lawful authority of the Lebanese Government throughout its territory. The future role of the United Nations in Lebanon  following recent developments  is not yet clear. At present some 6 000 troops are stationed in southern Lebanon  among them 750 Irish troops. From the outset the conditions under which UNIFIL has been obliged to operate have been far from satisfactory  a situation exacerbated by Israel's second invasion of Lebanon last year. None the less  I believe that for the time being UNIFIL  however circumscribed its role  continues to carry out useful functions. It is fitting that I should pay a tribute to the commitment  dedication to duty and courage of all the troops serving under the United Nations flag in Lebanon in difficult and often dangerous circumstances.81.	The conflict in Lebanon is the latest in the long series of conflicts that have taken place in the Middle East. It is a reflection on the international community that after nearly 40 years the fundamental problems of the Middle East remain unresolved.82.	The basic principles upon which Ireland and our partners in the European Community believe solutions could be based have been set out by the Foreign Minister of Greece in his address on behalf of the member States of the Community. I must  however  emphasize the urgency of dealing with one particular aspect. In the territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war a process is in train which may very soon create a situation which cannot be reversed. The purported annexation of EastJerusalem and the Golan Heights has already been rejected as invalid by Ireland. The West Bank of the Jordan and the Gaza Strip have not been annexed by Israelâat least not yet. But the infrastructural and demographic alterations being planned and rapidly put into effect there by the Israeli authorities cannot but lead to de facto absorption by Israel of the territories. What is going on is no secret  but the process is gradual and insidious. It may lack the dramatic impact of an invasion by a modem army and thus may not have attracted the attention of the international community  but it is no less real for all that. If all our words about seeking a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through a formula guaranteeing the rights of both peoples are to have any force in practice there will have to be a place  a physical location  in which Palestinian self-determination can be exercised. It follows that the acquisition by Israel of the West Bank would make a mockery of the international commitment to the rights of the Palestinian people and prolong this bitter conflict.83.	In Africa there are several disputes and conflicts which cause concern because of the direct suffering and loss of life involved and because of the serious danger of such disputes becoming caught up in super-Power rivalries. In our view  Africa's problems should be resolved through existing regional institutions  in particular the OAU. We hope that the negotiations under way under the auspices of the OAU with a view to ending the present conflict in Chad will lead to an early settlement.84.	In southern Africa what stands out is the fact that yet another year has passed and the prospect of independence for Namibia is no closer. The people of Namibia  who have suffered so much  and the international community  which has devoted so much effort to implement the United Nations plan  are asked to show still more forbearance and still more patience. One wonders how long it will be possible to carry on in this way  from year to year  while South Africa devises still more stratagems to prevent the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and flouts the will of the international community. In January 1981 South Africa regarded implementation as premature and said that it did not regard the United Nations as sufficiently impartial; most recently South Africa has made it clear that it will not agree to implementation of resolution 435 (1978) until there has been a withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. We reject such efforts to link or subordinate Namibia's right to independence to extraneous issues. We call on South Africa to reconsider its attitudes so that the people of Namibia may achieve the peace  justice and freedom which they deserve and which is their right.85.	In South Africa itself the apartheid system  despite some superficial modifications  remains fundamentally unchanged. The oppressive enforcement of the apartheid laws  including the banning or imprisonment of those whose only crime is to oppose the system  still continues. We urge the South African Government to release those who have been imprisoned for their beliefs  especially Nelson Mandela.86.	Moreover  South Africa has been making efforts evidently aimed at destabilizing neighbouring States. We condemn such actions. They will not divert international attention from South Africa's internal problems  but by exporting violence from South Africa into the region as a whole they carry with them the danger of escalating conflict  which may prove disastrous for all involved  including South Africa itself.87.	The need for concerted international pressure on South Africa to change its policies remains. There can be no compromise on the principle of the equality of every human being or on the need to have that principle observed in practice. That is why the Security Council must continue its consideration of measures to increase the pressure on South Africa for change. For our own part  Ireland will continue to work for a strengthening of the existing arms embargo as well as for the adoption of further mandatory sanctions  such as an oil embargo  and a ban on new direct investment in South Africa.88.	The export of violence is not confined to South Africa. The situation created in Afghanistan by the Soviet intervention continues to be a source of both regional tension and international concern. It has brought great suffering to millions of Afghans and caused immense problems for those countries to which large numbers of Afghan refugees have fled. Conditions must be created in which the people of Afghanistan can determine their own form of government free from outside interference. United Nations resolutions adopted by an overwhelming majority of the General Assembly set out the principles on which a political settlement should be based.89.	United Nations resolutions also set the framework for a comprehensive political solution in Kampuchea. The suffering of the people of that country at the hands of a cruel domestic regime has been followed by the hardships imposed by foreign occupation.90.	Ireland welcomes the continuing efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations to find a political solution. We believe that Viet Nam and other nations whose co-operation is essential for arriving at a peaceful solution should now join in a process of negotiations leading to a comprehensive political solution.91.	The Irish Government and people continue to be deeply concerned over the tragic situation in Central America. We believe that the essential causes of conflict there are the long-standing inequities in social and economic conditions and the denial of the people's justified demands for fundamental reform. This region has witnessed flagrant denial of human rights and callous disregard by certain Governments of what is the very basis of morality and civilized social orderâthe fundamental dignity and worth of the human person. We are convinced that just and lasting solutions to the grave problems in Central America can be achieved only by political means  through dialogue  conciliation and negotiation. It is for this reason that my Government particularly welcomes the efforts of the Contadora Group to achieve a lasting peace  based on the principles of self-determination and the right of each country in the region to determine its own destiny free from outside interference.92.	Central America is only one of many regions where human rights are abused. Such abuses have become so widespread and so common that there is a danger that they may be accepted as an inevitable feature of modem life. Resignation and complacency can also become the enemies of justice. For this reason we must continue to use the United Nations both to defend human rights and to expose atrocities. It is important that the Commission on Human Rights continue to develop its investigative powers and that States co-operate with it in this regard.93.	In the view of my Government  the United Nations has played and must continue to play a leading role in the progressive development and codification of principles aimed at effective and universal implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Ireland therefore was gratified that last year the General Assembly adopted resolution 37/200* In our view  the balanced approach in this resolution should guide the further work of the United Nations in this area.94.	Human rights and fundamental freedoms also have economic and social dimensions. Freedom from want and the right to economic security are indispensable elements of a just and civilized international order. Economic recession and the failure to cope with the problems of uneven development and unequal distribution of wealth in an interdependent world affect every country  even the richest  and touch all our lives. But in such conditions it is the weakest economies which suffer most and which are slowest to reap the benefits of any recovery. The statistics of debt and deprivation throughout the developing world  especially among the least developed  make depressing reading.95.	Economic recovery cannot come too soon  but recovery alone will not be enough. We agree with the Secretary-General's view  expressed after the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  that decisions and action on liquidity and finance are urgently required if the desperate plight of the low- income and least-developed countries is to be alleviated. It is not easy to be generous in times of global economic hardship  but the depth of the crisis in which some countries find themselves cannot and must not be ignored.96.	However  the year has not been without some positive developments. There are indications  even if uncertain  of an improvement in the economic climate. The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  while it did not live up to expectations  did produce some agreed positions which point the way to future progress. Developed and developing countries have come somewhat closer to recognizing their economic interdependence. The challenge to the General Assembly is to ensure that the search for global solutions to the most pressing economic problems of our time continues.97.	I should like  in conclusion  to speak about the continuing crisis in Northern Ireland. Ten years ago my predecessor  now Prime Minister of Ireland  came to the Assembly with a message of hope. The Governments of Ireland and of the United Kingdom  together with democratically elected representatives of the majority and minority sections of the community in Northern Ireland  had devised a means of giving fair and just government to Northern Ireland. This provided for a Northern Ireland executive representative of both sections of the community and a council of Ireland with which the minority section of the community could identify. This unprecedented collective effort fell victim to the intransigence which has bedevilled Northern Ireland since the partition of Ireland and to a lack of resolution at that time on the part of Government.98.	It is sobering to compare the hopes of a decade ago with the political landscape which confronts Irish men and Irish women today. In the absence of a just and workable political process the people of Northern Ireland are deeply divided  and division is nurtured and fed upon by the gunmen. Distrust and hostility are rife. The Northern Ireland Assembly  an institution in which minority representatives will not participate because of the failure to accommodate in any substantive way their identity and their role in decision-making  is evidence of the political tragedy which afflicts Northern Ireland.99.	Faced with this situation  with all its inherent dangers of further communal strife and frustration  my Government decided to establish a New Ireland Forum for consultations on the manner in which lasting peace and stability could be achieved in a new Ireland. The first meeting of the New Ireland Forum took place on 30 May of this year and was attended by representatives of the two parties in my Government  the main opposition party in the South and representatives of the nationalist section of the community in Northern Ireland. The elected representatives of the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland were invited to participate fully in the deliberations of the Forum but declined to do so. Naturally we greatly regret this. We are encouraged  however  by the volume of impressive written contributions from individual Unionists  several of whom will give oral evidence to the Forum itself. The Forum is a unique venture in the history of Ireland. It represents a genuine attempt by those who believe in a new Ireland and who unequivocally reject the men of violence and their spokesmen to address the problems which divide the people of our island.100.	Since that first meeting of the New Ireland Forum  the participants have been examining in a practical and pragmatic manner the various economic  social  cultural and political problems which divide us. I would hope that when this work is finished we shall be able to present to all the people of Ireland  and indeed the people of Britain  a clear and realistic analysis of the current situation as well as imaginative  generous and workable ideas to construct arrangements for a new Ireland with which all sides could identify and which all the protagonists in this crisis could support.101.	Any such arrangements would require the full and active support of both the British and the Irish Governments. I am glad to say that  following a period of difficulty  the relations between Dublin and London have been normalized and the Anglo-Irish dialogue has been fully resumed and even developed. This  together with the work of the New Ireland Forum  gives us hope and gives hope to those who continue to sufferâthe people of Northern Ireland. The efforts of men and women of goodwill in our two countries to solve this tragic crisis deserve the support not alone of our two peoples but of the entire international community in general and of this institution in particular.

"67",3285,"IRN",38,1983,"ï»¿ ""Those not following the true path of God exploit theirriches in obstructing others from the path of God andthus scatter their wealth; but they shall only rue it  andin the end  they will be defeated and driven into hell.""First of all  Sir  I wish to congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I also take this opportunity to convey our gratitude and appreciation to the President of the previous session for his dedicated and successful direction of that session.Our delegation hopes that at the present session the Assembly will pursue the aims and objectives represented by its agenda and find suitable solutions for the difficulties and problems of our world today.This session takes place at a time when the economic  social and political crises in the world have  regrettably  acquired far more threatening dimensions than when we last met here. Despite all the promises and agreements and all the resolutions adopted at the previous session  violations of the rights of the oppressed nations by the super-Powers have increased in an unprecedented manner.I do not think that there is a representative here who is not fully aware of the impressive number and volume of resolutions adopted and of the fiery speeches and statements made at the previous session in which love of peace and hatred of war-mongering and the violation of the rights of peoples were eloquently expressed. In spite of all that  not a day or night has passed since the last General Assembly session without the big Powers and their clients and cronies trampling upon the rights of the oppressed  spilling their blood and spreading injustice to the far corners of the world. In fact  nothing is left of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations except a meaningless framework; the concepts of liberty  freedom and social justice have been sadly ridiculed by the oppression  suppression and savagery of those evil Powers.Words and deeds  theory and practice  are constantly diverging at an astonishing speed. Our world today is suffering above all from a grave moral crisis  and if we do not confront this problem seriously and collectively it will most dangerously threaten our human life and human values. At the price of the long and bitter experiences we have endured  and having learnt from painful historic events  we have arrived at the conclusion that moral degradation or cultural sickness is the breeding ground for all forms of poverty  slavery and submissive- ness on the one hand and all forms of oppression  exploitation  expansionism and suppression on the other. Although this is a truism for all humanity  in this phase of human history  when only moral and spiritual values could lay a sound foundation for social relations among nations and dignified ways of life for people  unfortunately there is no sign of any code of human behaviour or set of rules inspired by ethical considerations or spiritual values.Today a very basic question that we must ask ourselves is where we are heading. Is it not time for the international community to stop and search its conscience as it thinks about its future  and thus find an appropriate  human answer? Is not the situation in most parts of the world sufficiently saddening and heart-rending? Can we have any hope that the United Nations will be able to combat the monsters of hunger and poverty  aggression and war  colonialism and exploitation while most Members of the Organization are being squeezed in the claws of one super-Power or the other?It is very unfortunate that some of us  as representatives of our nations  have even lost the most natural human sensibilities with regard to the most horrendous acts of the super-Powers today. It is as if we lived in a world completely divorced from reality. Has not the time come for us to think about our condition  to rediscover ourselves and to find out what kind of world our world is?Allow me to answer the last question by describing the mortifying  inhuman situations in some parts of our world. As a Muslim and the representative of a nation that has always put the fight against the evil of Zionism foremost  I will start with the question of Palestine.For 36 years now the oppressed and downtrodden people of Palestine have been subjected to the savage aggressions of the usurper Zionist military camp in the Middle East. For the past 36 years the history of the tyrannized people of Palestine has been written in blood by the successors to Hitler. During all this time the United Nations has routinely adopted resolutions which have been of no practical use. The regime occupying Palestine  enjoying the unconditional support of the Big Satan  has not cared a fig for these resolutions but has constantly assaulted the Palestinian people and invaded other Islamic countries. Aggression and transgression are intrinsic characteristic? of this regime; there would be no definition of Zionism if aggression were left out. That is why we have always maintained that peaceful negotiations with these Nazis of supposedly Jewish origin to put an end to their intrinsic aggressive motif will lead nowhere and have not led anywhere. Why do we not learn from the past? Why can we not understand that  apart from the incorrigible nature of Zionism  negotiating or reaching understanding with an enemy that is occupying our territory produces no results except to give it an unfair advantage?If it had not be or Camp David  the beautiful land of Lebanon will not have been drenched in blood by Zionist atrocities today. After all these bitter experiences  are we not right today to think of the acceptance of plans like the Fez plan  the so-called Reagan plan or the pact between Lebanon and Israel as not only a betrayal of the Palestinian cause but also a greater betrayal of the aspirations of some one billion Muslims throughout the world?There is no cure for the cancerous growth of Zionism except surgery. If the Allies could have persuaded Hitler to withdraw and recognize the rights of other nations  then we could do the same with the Zionists today. There is no doubt that United States imperialism and Zionism are conducting a co-ordinated policy designed to obliterate the national and religious identity of the persecuted Palestinian people and  by employing political  military and publicity conspiracies  to destroy the cause of Palestine in the long term. The increasing presence of United States and French imperialist forces has only one meaning: the imperialist oppressors have decided to oppose the freedom and independence of all Muslim nations of the world in a final confrontation. Does the bombardment of Muslim residential areas of Lebanon by United States  French and other aggressive Powers point to any other intention?If the United Nations feels obliged to give practical effect to the principles of its Charter regarding the safeguarding of international peace and security  it should advocate an all-out military and economic embargo against the Zionist usurper regime; it should also create a system for supervising the correct implementation of the embargo so that any State not complying with it would be identified. The United Nations must carry out its legal obligations with regard to Articles 41 and 42 in Chapter VII of the Charter in respect of international peace and security. The United Nations should  on the basis of the principles of its Charter  condemn the United States and French Governments for their military aggression against Lebanon and the violation of the rights of the Lebanese people. Finally  I should add that  under Article 6 the Zionist regime should be expelled from the United Nations for persistent violation of the principles of the Charter.Today  however  the tyrannized and oppressed people of Palestine remain as tyrannized and oppressed as ever. The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the settlement of the Palestine question lies in joint international action to remove the causes of aggression in a decisive and forceful confrontation with the aggressor to ease the way for the return of the Palestinian people to their homeland and the establishment of an independent Palestine in all the occupied lands belonging to the Palestinian people. We are convinced that victory in this struggle cannot be won except by following the sublime teachings of Islam  by emphasizing our human values and by the mobilization of the Muslim masses and all freedom-loving people of the world against rulers and regimes dependent on the United States Satan and its Zionist hired gun.The delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran expresses its full support for the armed struggle of the Palestinian people to win back their stolen rights  draws the attention of every individual Member State and the United Nations as a whole to their obligations and commitments regarding this great question and warns all responsible Member States that the collapse of the cause of Palestine would mean the impotence and bankruptcy of the whole international community in regard to the aggressive Zionist regime and its oppressive allies. We should also add that the cause of Palestine is an inseparable and integrated part of the cause of the Islamic people throughout the world. If any one of us in the Islamic world were to remain indifferent to the situation in Palestine and allow the aggressive  racist regime more time  we should one after another fall victim to the expansionist policies of that chronic aggressor. We must all learn  once and for all  that force does not recognize any logic but the logic of force.The great danger inherent in failing to confront aggressors forcefully is not only that it helps the continuance of aggression in a particular case; the great danger lies also in the fact that such an attitude will persuade and encourage all other potentially aggressive forces. If some of the regimes ruling over Islamic countries had not adopted a submissive  impotent attitude with regard to the Zionist non-entity and its gun-toting supporter  the Big Satan  surely the atheist Government of the Soviet Union would not have dared enter the Islamic land of Afghanistan. And if the great people of Viet Nam had not fought the United States aggressors so heroically and ceaselessly  we would certainly be witnessing today the arrogant galloping of the super-Power horses over a large part of the third world. Thus  the armed resistance of an invaded nation will not only benefit those fighting against aggression but also guarantee the independence and national sovereignty of all other nations.It is for that reason that the three-year-old armed struggle of the Afghan people against the occupying Russian force is and will remain a sublime example of a people's heroic resistance in the eyes of the peoples of the third world in general and the great Islamic family in particular.It is high time that the world community paid serious attention to the question of Afghanistan. The slaughtering of the defenceless Afghan people who  with a minimum of possibilities  heroically resist a mighty foreign invasion of their country  the continuous bombardment of the homes and farms of the deprived people of Afghanistan  the use of deadly chemicals and the killing and injuring of a large number of people and the resultant refugee status of some four million people cannot be settled at negotiating tables at Geneva in the absence of the true representatives of the Afghan people. The Soviet Union is treading the same path already trodden by the United States in Viet Nam  and if it insists on this policy it will be taught the same lesson by the Afghan people that the American Satan learned from the Vietnamese.The people of the Islamic Republic of Iran  who have so much in common with the Afghan people  will not remain silent about this invasion. The only way to settle the Afghanistan problem lies in the complete  unconditional and immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from Afghanistan  the non-intervention of other forces in the internal affairs of that country  the return of Afghan refugees to their homeland and the guarantee of the right of the people of Afghanistan to determine their own destiny. On this basis we reject any negotiation conducted in the absence of the true representatives of the Afghan nation. We further declare that the mature Afghan nation does not need a guardian  and no Government or international organization has the right to enter into negotiation on behalf of the Afghan people.It is now three years since the Iranian people was savagely invaded by world imperialism and its stooges. In the eyes of imperialism  the Muslim people of Iran had committed an unpardonable sin: they had won back their freedom and independence  they had refused the domination of the super-Powers and they had decided to work for justice and truth throughout the world. The Baathist regime of Iraq  representing the interests of imperialism  has for three years done everything in its power to destroy the economic and human resources of two Muslim peoples in the Middle East and has rendered considerable services to imperialism and world zionism in this respect. Three years ago  when our nation had just rid itself of the domination of the American Satan and his stooge  the ex- Shah  and was gradually taking difficult steps towards the reconstruction of the liberated land of Iran  the aggressive Baathists of Iraq invaded Iran in a marriage against the defenceless people of Persian  Arab and Kurdish origin  employing 12 well-equipped divisions  some 3 000 tanks and scores of bombers and helicopter gunships. They advanced to considerable depths inside our territory  which was only yesterday liberated from the claws of the Big Satan and its agent in Iran  the American Shah. Defenceless cities  towns and villages were invaded one after another; thousands of innocent men and women  young and old  were massacred; towns and villages were razed to the ground. And we realized that the price we had already paid to liberate our country from the domination of the West and the East and to gain freedom and independence was to be increased by more than we had imagined.Long before the Secretary-General of the Communist Tudeh Party of Iran  arrested on charges of shameless espionage for the Soviet Union  confessed in a television interview that the Soviet Union had already informed him of the imminent Iraqi invasion of Iran and that the Baathist chieftain was nursing the idea of ""liberating"" the Iranian oil-rich province of Khuzestan  many of us in Iran  having already witnessed the dropping of French- made  American-made and Russian-made missiles on our border towns and villages  were certain that the superpowers had already reached an agreement to support the Baathist regime of Iraq in its devastating invasion of revolutionary Iran.At that time  the aggressive regime of Saddam  intoxicated as it was with its easy Don Quixote victory against hospitals  mosques  schools and defenceless people  used arrogantly to declare in its official communiquÃ©s to the United Nations: ""Iraqi troops continue their march  inflicting further defeats on the Persian enemy"". That was a quote from a communiquÃ© by the so-called Revolutionary Command Council of Iraq. Do representatives know how the Security Council's President responded at that time? They should kindly take a look at the Security Council resolution 479 (1980) of 28 September 1980. Can anyone see anything whatsoever referring to the withdrawal of aggressive forces to international borders? Are we now permitted to ask why there was no such request? Are we too suspicious in assuming that the Security Council's silence on this vital point was in perfect harmony with the evil desires of the Iraqi Foreign Minister  expressed in his letter of 27 October 1980 to the Secretary-General  in which he declared:""In the light of the above-mentioned considerations  the Government of the Republic of Iraq wishes to point out that any call for the withdrawal of Iraqi forces  before Iran recognizes the said Iraqi sovereignty in practice and legally  is in our view a legal and practical impossibility  for Iran has not delimited its borders with Iraq in a precise manner. ""The lands reached so far by Iraqi forces are the necessary positions for defence until Iran recognizes our rights and guarantees are reached for the achievement of a final and permanent solution to the dispute. ""Does this contain any respect for Article 1  paragraph 1 and for Article 2  paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Charter of the United Nations? Does such a regime respect international security?In paragraph 3 of Security Council resolution 479 (1980)  the Council ""Calls upon all other States to exercise the utmost restraint and to refrain from any act which may lead to a further escalation and widening of the conflict"". Did the permanent members of the Security Council not vote in favour of this resolution?Have the Governments of the United States  the Soviet Union and France  as permanent members of the Security Council  not violated their own crookedly adopted resolution by supplying the Iraqi regime with huge military and financial assistance? Had all the missiles and bombs dropped on our defenceless civilian population for two years after the adoption of this resolution been delivered to the aggressive regime of Iraq from the planet Mars? Why has this flagrant violation of resolution 479 (1980) never been questioned? Why on earth did the Security Council keep quiet about this war for two years? Did the crimes by the Baathist military deep inside our territory not threaten the peace and security of the world? Where have all these people who are now moaning and wailing about a threat to peace in the region been hiding all this time? Certainly all fair-minded informed people know that what is being threatened at present is not peace or security but the regime of Saddam and the interests of his super-Power supporters.The deadly  indifferent silence of the Security Council has accompanied the boastful propaganda of the Iraqi Baathists  who were spilling the blood of countless Iranian Muslims for almost two years. Our war-stricken people knew right from the beginning that the real motive behind the Baathist Iraqi invasion of Iran was not the occupation of parts of our country. The Iraqi Baathists were striving in earnest for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran.We are convinced that because we are an independent nation and are determined to remain so  we are alone and have to fight an enemy that is supported by practically all the members of the oppressive club of the world single-handedly. The great mobilization of our people and their swift movement towards the battlefronts upset all evil calculations. The port city of Khorramshahr was liberated after heavy fighting  and the defeated Iraqi mercenaries started their hasty retreat. And then the Foreign Minister of the Iraqi regime wrote to the Secretary-General on 27 October 1980  ""On the basis of military consideration and topography  there may be better positions forward for defensive purposes but there are none backward.Yes  this very same regime  following the Khorramshahr defeat and the speedy destruction of the Iraqi occupying army at the hands of our people  in an acrobatic gesture turned into a peace-loving government overnight and declared that it had unilaterally  and amazingly  decided to evacuate the occupied Iranian territories. And the Security Council  also amazingly  broke its two- year-old silence and requested both belligerent parties to evacuate all occupied territories.Two years of occupation of our territories in no way threatened international peace and security  but the very first defeats of the aggressors in our territory immediately did so. Was our nation not justified in rejecting this ridiculous logic of the Security Council?I am certain that most representatives have already studied the report by the United Nations mission that visited liberated territories in our country. The mission also visited Iraq  inspected its border towns and cities  and prepared a report on the subject. Although the report does not cover all the facts regarding the Iranian side of this tragic story  it has  nevertheless  reported some of the facts without bias or prejudice. We request those who have not studied this report to do so and make a comparison of its contents with the official communiquÃ©s and press releases which the governments of the aggressive regime and of the invaded country have so far submitted to the General Assembly or to the Secretary-General. A comparative study of this kind will tear the peace-loving mask off the ugly face of the brutally aggressive Iraqi Baathist regime. The report shows that the majority of our occupied towns and cities were ninety per cent  and sometimes one hundred per cent  destroyed by mechanical and engineering equipment  in direct violation of the articles of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12 August 1949/ The cities of Hoveyzeh  Khorramshahr and Qasr-i-Shirin fall into this category. On the Iraqi side  a glimpse at the report shows that the Iraqi Baathists failed miserably to prove what they claimed. Does this document not indicate to everyone that the Muslim people of Iran  who have been victims of a beastly aggression and who have for three years suffered the daily mindless bombardments of the aggressor and received hundreds of deadly missiles  has followed its Islamic teachings strictly and has refrained from retribution against Iraqi towns and cities within easy range of Iranian artillery?The Assembly has heard what the Iraqi Foreign Minister said about the peaceful intentions of the Iraqi regime. But I draw your attention to what the Iraqi regime has done  only during the last few months  to the cities of Piranshahr  Baneh  Marivan  Andimeshk and Gilan Gharb in western Iran. The Foreign Minister of Iraq talks about peace and peaceful solutions when the streets  residential areas  and market-places in these towns are still wet with the blood of innocent and defenceless women and children.But this is only a small part of the tragic  bloody story of the Baathists' mad invasion of Iran. Is there anyone who does not know about the catastrophe of the oil spill in the Persian Gulfâa deliberate attempt  outside the war zone  to pollute the waters of the Gulf  endanger marine life and threaten the interests of the coastal countries? Do we not know that the Iraqi regime desperately tried to link the question of checking the oil spill with the whole theatre of war  and by delaying and stopping the operations to stop the spill proved once again that it was ready to sacrifice the vital interests of the coastal countries and upset their ecology for its own selfish designs and inhuman objectives?Fortunately  a few days ago our oil technicians and experts  having overcome enormous obstacles and with a great deal of self-sacrifice  succeeded in completely harnessing one of the damaged oil wells that was gushing some 2 000 barrels of oil into the waters of the Persian Gulf. This remarkable achievement is indicative of the keen interest of the Islamic Republic of Iran in safeguarding the interests of the States of the region and of its ability to do so. But would it be possible to ensure the interests of the States in the region for an extended period of time? Who could guarantee that the aggressive regime of Iraq will not tomorrow issue another communiquÃ©  similar to military communiquÃ© No. 1106  dated 2 March 1982  in which its assault on oil wells and their destruction will be lauded as another great military victory  once again endangering the interests of the Persian Gulf States?Let us imagine that towards the end of the Second World War  when the days of Nazi aggression were numbered and the Allied armies were liberating one European city after another  the war-stricken people of Europe  whose nearest and dearest were murdered by Hitler's invading armies  were suddenly to hear Hitler in a press conference on the wireless declaring his deep love for peace and security and condemning the Allied forces' aggression in the occupied territories and unable to understand why the Allies were not ready to sit at the negotiating table with him and solve all problems in an amicable atmosphere. How would the victims of his brutality feel? Hitler does not seem to have had this bitter sense of humour or to have been hypocritical enough to do this. Unfortunately  the little Baathist successors of Hitler have this bitter sense of humour  and their hypocrisy knows no bounds.We live in an absolutely unfair world. Twice in the past few months we informed the United Nations that the Iraqi regime was intending to launch missile attacks against cities and residential areas  a few days prior to the occurrence of these atrocities. This  of course  does not imply any gift of prophecy on our part. We know from bitter experience that each time the Baathist cowards lose on the battlefield  they resort to this sort of remote- control mass murder with their long-range Russian- and French-made missiles. Security Council documents dated 5 May 1983  and 4 August 1983 "" respectively  bear witness to the validity of our statement. In both cases  our forewarnings were realized  but on both bloody occasions the United Nations did not turn a hair. How long can this unjust and inhuman treatment continue?In spite of all this  we want the Assembly to know that no matter how far the Iraqi regime goes in its crimes against our people  one thing will not change  and that is the sworn resolution of our united Muslim people to win back its stolen rights and to punish the war criminals. The intensification of Baathist crimes against our people and the continuation of aggression have rendered all peace proposals unlikely and unacceptable. However  we shall not compromise one iota of our legitimate rights. And we should add here that those who obstruct the realization of our legitimate demands will bear the responsibility of prolonging this war. Here  we warn those Powers which constantly fuel the Iraqi war machine and simultaneously broadcast rumours of lack of security in the Persian Gulf  in order to prepare the ground for their own military presence in a region in whose troubled waters none will be able to fish.We assure the world community that as long as we can safeguard our own economic interests in the Persian Gulf we will guarantee the safe passage of vessels according to international laws and regulations. We are certain that our conduct so far has already displayed our ability to fulfil this responsibility  and we want the world community to know that our successful  legitimate defence of our country and the suppression of the aggressor will certainly result in peace  security and tranquillity for all countries of the region  a lasting peace which could consolidate closer friendly relations among all on the basis of mutual respect.But we declare loudly and clearly that we shall no longer tolerate the passage of vessels loaded with war munitions sent by the world's merchants of death for the Iraqi regime through the Strait of Hormuz towards certain ports in the southern part of the Persian Gulf and that in future we shall be enforcing our authority in this vital respect less leniently than before. We also announce to the world that any misguided adventure detrimental to the vital interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran will immediately result in the complete closure of the Strait of Hormuz and the stoppage of the flow of oil from that region. It should be absolutely clear that those supplying the aggressor with sophisticated weapons will be held responsible for such a development and will have to bear the consequences. In this respect  we address ourselves especially to the Government of France  which has  with a great deal of ignorance and effrontery  embarked on such a hazardous pursuit. We warn the so-called socialist Government of France  which is more than a century behind the times and at present is ridiculously imitating the nineteenth-century colonialists  of the consequences of its actions. The so-called socialist Government of France does not seem to have realized that the world has changed and the age of gunboat diplomacy has long passed. If the Government of France does not awaken to the realities of the twentieth century and if any aggressive Government dares approach us in the Persian Gulf  we shall  as a first step  turn it into a big graveyard for the aggressors. And let us not forget that Iran  and especially Islamic Iran  has been the land of men and women who  through their scientific achievements and military genius  have often played a vital role in the destiny of humanity.Unfortunately  these violations and acts of aggression are being committed by the oppressive Powers throughout the world  and in particular in the third world. Let us look at Africa. In that continent a raw wave of neo colonialism has struck the long-oppressed African people  and the tragic memories of the nineteenth century's colonial scramble are revived. We strongly condemn the delivery of war equipment to Chad by France and the United States  the sole objective of which is to continue colonial domination and to plunder the natural resources of the African people. The so-called socialist Government of France is nowadays becoming an especially dangerous element in the world. Faced with the bankruptcy of its economic policies  it has embarked on a policy of global military adventure and support of aggressive Governments and despots. The socialist Government of France not only has violated all international conventions but has not even respected those resolutions of the Security Council that bear its own worthless signature.The Islamic Republic of Iran  while treasuring the rich culture  literature and valuable liberal traditions of the French people  with whom we have maintained time- honoured relations  strongly and unequivocally condemns the present Government of France for its violation of other nations' rights  and we demand the immediate withdrawal of all oppressive forces from Chad  while we are certain that the people of Chad will not tolerate the presence of oppressive troops on their soil.For years the Muslim people of Western Sahara  led by the POLISARIO Front have been fighting for their independence and national sovereignty. We declare our whole-hearted support for their struggle. We believe that the military occupation of Western Sahara must come to an end in accordance with the resolutions approved at the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983  and the resolutions adopted by the United Nations. It is time that dependent regimes in Africa understood that serving imperialist interests and moving along crooked paths led by the super-Powers will not help them in the least.The people of the Middle East and Western Asia whole-heartedly sympathize with their African brothers and sisters because  apart from common experience and a common history of anti-colonialist struggle  both peoples have in the last four decades become the victims of savage  racist regimes supported by the United States Satan. The South African racist regime has been aptly called the Israel of Africa. Racism and Zionism share the same background and the same purpose. They both believe in the violation of the rights of other nations. They both advocate violent usurpation of other peoples' lands. They both have no respect for world public opinion or for the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations  and they both mean to upset the norms of international relations. Those two evil forces  Zionism and racism  obey the law of the jungle in international relations  and their design is to invade other free nations of the world once they have consolidated their evil rule over the lands they have already occupied and their peoples.I have just been handed a note providing information on another Iraqi missile attack against two cities in IranâAndimeshk and Dezful. It is interesting that two days ago our delegation to the United Nations foresaw such a missile attack and informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations accordingly. But  unfortunately  as usual no steps were taken against attacks on residential areas of our cities.I shall now read out the details:""At 2.24 p.m. local time yesterday  four points were attacked by Iraqi missiles in Andimeshk and Dezful with the following casualties and damage: in Dezful  31 people martyred and 130 injured  with 95 residential areas totally destroyed and 230 partly destroyed  including 60 shops destroyed; in Andimeshk  23 people martyred and 120 injured  with 60 residential areas totally destroyed and 120 partly destroyed.""We are sure  of course  that the United Nations and other international institutions  because of the manipulations of the oppressor super-Powers  cannot do much  and we do not expect much. We have just given this information so that members of the Assembly may have a clearer picture of what is going on and understand why we feel that the only way to respond to this ruthless enemy is on the field of battle. Of course  desperate attempts of this sort are further proof of the enemy's weakness. They show that the enemy is collapsing and that Saddam has no place among his own people and that in the very near future he will be defeated.118. I shall now continue my statement. It is necessary that the United Nations  having diagnosed the racist disease that is threatening the body of the world community like cancer  and having regard to its obligations and commitments regarding the safeguarding of undeniable human rights and respect for the rights of self- determination and national sovereignty of nations  should take effective measures to eradicate racial discrimination and Zionist racism from the face of the earth and carry out its historic mission of honouring its principles concerning peace  security and human rights.The Islamic Republic of Iran  while extending its full support to the oppressed people of Namibia  demands the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces of the racist South African Government and urges all revolutionary countries of Africa and all progressive movements  and above all the South West Africa People's Organization  the true representative of the oppressed Namibian people  to continue their heroic  legitimate struggle. We strongly condemn the colonialist governments which support the aggressive racist Pretoria regime in the face of United Nations resolutions and the principles of its Charter  and we express our firm support for the efforts and struggles of anti-colonialist  anti-racist African countries  especially Angola  Mozambique and Zimbabwe.The situation in Latin America is not much healthier than that in Africa or the Middle East  because of the satanic policies of gringo imperialism. The unobstructed brazen intervention of Big Satan in the internal affairs of the countries of this region  especially in Nicaragua and El Salvador  not only has violated the principles of the Charter of the United Nations in a most shameless manner but also is threatening the peace and security of the world we live in. The Islamic Republic of Iran  while condemning these international colonial policies  praises all combative forces on the Latin American political scene which have courageously risen up to fight Big Satan  the source of all evil on earth  and to get rid of all its Latin American lackeys. We declare our full support for these liberation movements against American imperialism  and we believe that the decisions of the Contadora Group may serve as a suitable basis for the solution of problems in Latin America and the cessation of external intervention and aggression.We sincerely believe it is time that all the peoples of the world who have risen up to win back their legitimate rights drummed into the heads of all aggressors and transgressors in the world the fact that no nation needs their godforsaken suzerainty or Moody paternalism. It is also time that any nation which has been torn apart through the super-Powers' international conspiracies did everything in its power to reunite and to revive its cultural and national unity. The struggle of the people of the Korean peninsula is an example par excellence in this respect.I now turn to the grave question of the arms race. The second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament faced failure as a result of the super-Powers' obstruction and lack of co-operation. The special session instructed the Committee on Disarmament to prepare a comprehensive programme acceptable to all members and to present it at the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Has that Committee succeeded in its mission  or must the people of the world continue to live in anxiety  terror and horror caused by the domineering ambitions of the super-Powers  while those Powers continue their deceitful  useless negotiations? What has so far come out of the bilateral Soviet-American negotiations on the limitation of medium-range missiles and strategic arms  the outcome of which may decide the fate of some four billion people on our planet?Today  the implementation phase of the decision to deploy more than 500 missiles and nuclear warheads in Europe  including Pershing II and cruise missiles  has already begun. That part of the world has already been turned into a powder keg  and it would take only a simple mistake  a small miscalculation or a little spark to set the whole of the European continent aflame and to sacrifice the European peoples on the satanic altar of the superpowers and drag the other parts of the world into the fire started by them.Each super-Power tries to justify its illogical position by the incorrect attitude of the other. The Soviet Union declares that if those missiles are deployed by the West it will have to strengthen its own missile system  while the United States Satan justifies its opposition to the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean because of the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan. The convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean  set for 1983  has once again been postponed. We welcome the pleasant change in the positions of those countries which initially opposed the convening of that Conference but have come to appreciate the urgency of the matter and are already working for the preparation of a resolution on this matter to be submitted to the General Assembly. We hope that other Member States will join them. At present  more than at any time in the past  international peace and security require that the Indian Ocean zone should remain free from the super-Powers' arms race and not be infested by nuclear weapons.Last year the proposal on non-first use of nuclear weapons produced a glimmer of hope in the anxious hearts of mankind  and it was optimistically expected that other States would support the proposal and instead of talks and speeches take a practical step in the direction of relaxing existing tensions. Unfortunately  however  the actions of the super-Powers show that their claims on non-first use  the reduction and control of arms expenditure or the limitation of the number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles was nothing but an empty political gesture designed for their own publicity purposes.At this juncture I deem it necessary to deal briefly with the world economic situation. The adoption of defensive protectionist measures have led to the continued decline in the volume of world trade. The simultaneous drastic decline in the prices of basic commodities and the rapid increase in the prices of the industrial exports of the developed countries have caused a further deterioration in the terms of trade.The current monetary and financial crisis  further exacerbated by the specific policies of the United States Satan and its industrial allies  along with their imposition of various restrictions intended to impede the third world's access to concessional financial resources  international capital markets and technology  have all worked to worsen the current economic crisis and disrupt the process of development of the developing countries. A huge  rapid increase in the volume of the foreign debts of those countries  not to mention their consequent internal socio-political-economic hardships  is merely a manifestation of such a grave world economic crisis. It should be added  however  that contrary to the claims of the oppressors and dominators  the current difficulties in the world economic system are not cyclical at all. In fact they are structural problems arising from the existing unjust world capitalist system and the historic dominance of the privileged minority over the deprived majority. As the Assembly is well aware  the oppressors oppose any and all reforms in the prevailing world economic system; they adamantly resist even the minimum legitimate demands of the oppressed countries. Adopting a negative attitude towards the serious beginning of negotiations for the establishment of the new international economic order and evading participation in global negotiations are among the destructive policies of the oppressors in general  and United States imperialism in particularânotwithstanding their rhetoric about understanding and co-operation. Control of such institutions as IMF and the World Bank by the United States Satan and its advanced allies is a traditional channel of exerting pressure on the third world and impeding the realization of their demands.The conduct of the Governments of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâ especially the United Statesâin the course of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference or Trade and Development  held at Belgrade  was a true reflection of the aforementioned intentions  attitudes and methods. The resultant impasse at the Conference and its failure to adopt any positive and effective measures on all the disputed issues was nothing but the logical outcome of the intransigence and self-serving attitudes of these countries.It has often been repeated that global negotiations âif conducted in a serious and consistent manner  of courseâcan be considered to be the first step towards the alleviation of the current international economic crisis and the introduction of structural changes in the prevailing system. We believe that the negotiations will not get us anywhere before the oppressive domination of the super-Powers over the countries of the third world is annihilated and their stooges in these countries are overthrown. We are also of the opinion that limited and partial solutions  such as negotiations within the framework of the specialized agenciesâmanipulated as they are by the United States Satanâand resort to bilateralism as against multilateralism in financial relations only serve to preserve the present state of domination and control and further institutionalize the current crisis.The Islamic Republic of Iran rejects the present international order  in which our world is divided into the two poles of East and West. We believe that the balance of terror governing the world today  on which the present transient peace is based  will not guarantee the true peace  security and prosperity of the people of the world. The existing power blocs and military alignments have all brought our world to the precipice of war and annihilation.Since the end of the Second World War  the world has not enjoyed one single day free from local wars  cold war  tensions and serious dangers to peace.The super-Powers  in a ludicrous effort to justify their aggressions  constantly talk about ""threats to their vital interests""âas if they had some sort of natural rights in all the countries of the world  as if the rest of the world were their own backyard. Is this anything but a feeling of racial superiority? Does this not reveal their evil mentality of viewing all nations of the world as being in need of their ignorant over lordship? Every day we hear about American and French interests in the Persian Gulf  Soviet interests in Afghanistan or in Asia and Africa  and the United States Satan's interests all over the globe. Does all this have any basis except in racialism  arrogance and ignorance? Did Hitler stand for anything different? Unfortunately this sort of ""neo-logic"" is not used exclusively by the super-Powers but has also spread to their clients and cronies; a glimpse at communiques and political statements issued by the Baathist regime of Iraq  the Zionist regime occupying Palestine and the reactionary regime of South Africa proves that their mentality is infested with concepts of racial superiority and ethnic arrogance. That is why the socialist Government of France believes that the peoples of Iran and Iraq should be sacrificed at the altar of ""French interests"".The Government and the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran  inspired by the divine teachings of Islam  believe that all human beings are equal  and we absolutely reject the logic of racial discrimination through which the super-Powers intend to humiliate the rest of humanity. We believe  therefore  that our only hope lies in the collective movement of the oppressed nations of the world in the direction of ending the hegemony of the super-Powers.In this respect  we believe that the further strengthening of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  together with our insistent emphasis on the principle of non-alignment  will greatly facilitate the liberation of the oppressed from the yoke of super-Powers. In the present conditions of crisis and tensions in our world  and as long as the United Nations is crippled by the obstructions of the oppressive Powers and is not able to take practical  effective steps for the solution of numerous problems in the world  the all-important role of the Non-Aligned Movement in the relaxation of international tensions cannot be overemphasized. Nevertheless  the success of the Non-Aligned Movement is dependent on its ability to purge its ranks categorically of those stooges of the super-Powers that make a superficial claim to being non- aligned but in reality only serve the interests of world imperialism  thus guaranteeing its proper growth and direction. However  the achievements of the Non-Aligned Movement in finding solutions to certain world problems  and the sense of responsibility that the majority of its member States feel for its future  hold promise that the Movement will play a great  effective  historic role in the formation of future world policies.In spite of the fact that the efforts of the United Nations for the implementation of the fundamental principles of the Charter have so far not met with much success and although the Organization  despite considerable action  has not been able to achieve on the international scene the aims and objectives it was meant to achieve  the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran sincerely hopes that the General Assembly will liberate the United Nations from the claws of the oppressive big Powers and help it to realize its sacred objectives of peace  security  prosperity and the happiness of mankind. And may the peace of God be upon his true servants. "
"68",3332,"IRQ",38,1983,"ï»¿121.	I wish first to congratulate the President on his election to that office. My delegation is confident that he will conduct this session with complete success. For our part  we are fully prepared to co-operate with him to bring the work of this session to a successful conclusion  strengthen the role of the United Nations in solving international problems  and lay firm foundations for peace in the world.122.	It gives me pleasure to welcome the accession of Saint Christopher and Nevis to membership in the United Nations. I wish it progress and am sure it will make an effective contribution to the work of the Organization.123.	It is not often that the delegation of my country has begun its statement to the Assembly by addressing itself to issues that are of particular concern to Iraq. Iraq has always shown and continues to show serious and sincere interest in the major issues of its own area and in international issues of a wider scope. Our delegation has also focused on those issues which have had the effect of promoting the attainment of mankind's goals of liberation  progress and peace. But the aggression that has continued against my country for more than three years now cannot but assume the highest degree of importance among the issues with which our delegation is concerned and which it wishes to submit for discussion in this session.124.	For the fourth time since 1980 we meet here in this Hall while war continues to rage  with the regime in power in Teheran insisting on maintaining and widening the conflict and persistently pursuing its aggressive and expansionist designs and ambitions.125.	It is not for the first time that the Assembly is hearing about the controversies relating to this conflict  whether within the framework of the United Nations  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries or the Organization of the Islamic Conference  or on the bilateral level.126.	There has been some confusion with regard to the circumstances which led to the outbreak of the war. On several occasions in the past  representatives have heard various arguments and statements from both our delegation and the delegation of the other side. Iraq  however  firmly believing in the justice of its cause and having full confidence in the validity of its position  has now settled the argument. Iraq has invited the international community to arbitrate in this issue. We have submitted a proposal to this effect to the Islamic Good Offices Committee and to the Non-Aligned Movement  and our proposal was reiterated at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which met at New Delhi. We are reaffirming it now in the forum of the United Nations.127.	The Iraqi proposal calls for the formation of a neutral arbitration committee to determine which side started the aggression and the war and which side bears the responsibility for continuing the war all this time  with all the human and material losses that it has entailed. Iraq is prepared to accept the results of such arbitration.128.	If the other side dares see the truth uncovered in an objective manner  we urge it to accept this just  balanced and practical proposal. We hope the General Assembly will also support our proposal and entrust its implementation to the Secretary-General  who has been asked by the Security Council to undertake peace efforts.129.	While this constitutes the logical and sound solution to this problem  I do not think that anyone in the Hall is unaware of the well-known fact that it is the regime in power in Teheran which refuses to end the war and insists on its continuation. Iraq has agreed to all initiatives calling for an end to the war since 28 September 1980  when it unhesitatingly accepted Security Council resolution 479 (1980). Iraq has also accepted all the initiatives of the Islamic Good Offices Committee and responded positively to the initiatives of the Non-Aligned Movement. It has undertaken many initiatives of its own  calling for a cease-fire on religious occasions in order to provide the proper climate for ending the war. It has proposed the conclusion of a special agreement with Iran forbidding attacks against villages and cities and all civilian installations with a view to protecting human lives and material property.130.	In all these initiatives and deliberations Iraq did not set any pre-conditions. It has always expressed its readiness for a cease-fire and declared its wish to establish permanent peace with its neighbour based on the principles of the Charter  mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs.131.	You are all well aware of the attitudes of the Iranian government. This regime has earned for itself the discreditable distinction of being the only one in the world to reject Security Council cease-fire resolutions. It has also earned for itself the bad reputation of officially and ceaselessly expressing the wish to continue the war  to occupy Iraqi territory and to change the system of government in Iraq as well as in other countries of the area. Here I would like to draw the attention of representatives to the glaring discrepancy between the statements and declarations of the representatives of the Iranian regime in international forums and those emanating from the true authorities inside Iran. Words spoken in this Hall can have no serious meaning and cannot be regarded as honest if they are not in line with the official and existing positions taken by Governments. We can present hundreds of proofs attesting to the ambitious designs of the Teheran regime on our country. There are official Iranian declarations indenting that Iranian forces have occupied parts of Iraqi territory and expressing the determination of the Teheran rulers to occupy more territory  including villages and towns. These declarations also point to the insistence of those rulers on interfering in our internal affairs  and some of these declarations have been circulated as official records of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Such are the official and existing attitudes that ought to count  rather than the embellished words  full of hypocrisy  offered from the forums of international conferences and meetings for the purpose of deceiving and misleading international public opinion and avoiding pressure.132.	The history of the ruling clique in Iran abounds with attempts at blackmail. During the last few weeks  they came up with a fresh attempt of this kind when they launched their threats to close the Strait of Hormuz and prevent the Arab Gulf countries from exporting their oil. In fact  by its continued armed aggression against my country  the Iranian regime has deprived Iraq of the possibility of exporting its oil and engaging in free trade in the Gulf area. This constitutes an explicit threat to the vital interests of Iraq. Iraq  however  will not stand with arms folded before such a situation  nor can it be expected to submit to Iranian blackmail. I am sure that the States of the region  which cherish their dignity and independence  will not  for their part  submit to this sort of cheap blackmail. They have adequate means to deal with it. But it seems strange indeed that certain international quarters should see nothing wrong in this cheap blackmail and try to adopt attitudes that  if implemented  would only encourage the aggressor to persist in aggression and blackmail. We wish to make our position unequivocally clear: we are not prepared to tolerate blackmail by the regime in power in Teheran on the one side  and blackmail by the regime in power in Tel Aviv on the other. Our peoples have the will  the dignity and the strength that will enable them to withstand such blackmail and to make the aggressors see that their acts of aggression will inevitably cost them dear.133.	Iraq has always been concerned to see that peace and stability prevail in its area and that foreign influence be kept away from that area. This position of ours is quite clear and free from ambiguity. However  it should be equally clear that security  stability and prosperity should extend to all and be the responsibility of all. To shift the entire responsibility to one party with no regard to its security  its stability and its interests would be a most abnormal state of affairs. If anyone were to take such a position  Iraq would certainly not accept it. Iraq is prepared to undertake a joint  responsible search for ways to guarantee the security  stability and prosperity of the States of the area and the world at large  but only on condition that it will itself be assured of its rightful share of security  stability and prosperity rather than being asked to pay the whole price alone.134.	Within the framework of the search for guarantees of security and stability in the Arab Gulf areaâa sensitive region involving the interests of many countries of the worldâIraq  speaking through its President  Mr. Saddam Hussein  on 7 June 1983 called for the conclusion of a bilateral agreement between Iran and Iraq under the auspices of the United Nations with a view to ending all military operations in the Gulf area as a whole. This responsible proposal would bring many benefit  to the conflicting parties  banish a large part of the anxieties and tensions prevailing in the countries of the region and ensure the flow of oil and free trade in the Arab Gulf area. It would also help tackle the problems of pollution in the Gulf. If efforts or pressures should prove necessary to achieve these goals  they should be directed towards the regime in power in Teheran to ensure its acceptance of this practical  responsible and balanced proposal. I earnestly hope that the proposal will meet with acceptance and that the Secretary-General will take the necessary steps to have it implemented in the way he deems appropriate for supporting his necessary initiatives. My Government is perfectly willing to co-operate with him in all sincerity and with all seriousness  but we emphasize in this regard that these questions should not be dealt with in a manner that would diminish the effort required to end the war. The international community  and the United Nations in particular  has the direct responsibility to end this war. A special responsibility devolves upon the permanent members of the Security Council  which  in view of their special position in the Council and the realities of international relations  assume additional obligations with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security.135.	It is the duty of all these parties to persuade  if not force  Iran to end the war  which has lasted for such a long time and is now threatening the entire region with grave dangers.136.	We say this although we know well the details of the efforts and attempts which have been made to end the war. But we must state frankly here that those efforts have been far from adequate. Some of them have lacked the requisite measure of seriousness  continuity and perseverance; they could be described as efforts undertaken in a spirit of feigning action just to avoid blame rather than in the spirit of commitment  to say nothing of sacrifice  which is needed in order to put an end to this destructive and dangerous conflict. I would point out here the fact that all these initiatives have long been suspended. We also wish to point out  in all frankness  that there are plans aimed at prolonging the war to achieve certain selfish benefits or implement questionable scenarios in our region. We know all these things and we know who is behind them. We advise those who concoct them to abandon their games and stop playing with fire. We also tell them  in all frankness  that we cannot remain indifferent to their activities and that we shall not fall prey to treachery and deception. Our will is our own  and we have sufficient means to defend our security and our sovereignty. Our people have a will of steel; they have the capability and they have inexhaustible resources with which to defend their lives  their dignity  and their sovereignty and make the aggressor understand by tangible means that the cost of continuing his aggression will be very high indeed.137.	Besides the aggression against my country by the Iranian regime  there is the continued Zionist aggression from which the Arab nation and the Palestinian people have suffered for decades. The regime in power in Tel Aviv is based on racism  expansionism and aggression. It is a regime which scorns international law and all human considerations. It refuses most impudently to implement General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. It imposes on the region policies of terrorism  expansionism and destruction.138.	This fascist regime has a strange theory of security  a theory which is contrary to all the norms observed by the international community and to all the laws and customs of mankind. It allows itself to occupy the territories of others and to launch raids on neighbouring countries on the pretext that it is protecting its security  whereas all the world knows that it is that regime alone which has threatened and continues to threaten security and stability in the region.139.	My country was subjected to a flagrant aggression by that fascist regime when  on 7 June 1981  taking advantage of the circumstances created by the war of aggression waged by its fellow in thinking and in action  the Teheran regime  it attacked our installations for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.140.	If a number of States in this or any other region were to adopt the Israeli theory of security and the theories of the rulers in Teheran  who give themselves the right to expand and to change regimes  one could imagine how much anarchy  insecurity and instability would prevail in the whole world.141.	Such theories and practices must be resisted with all our might and by all the means at hand. We call upon all the countries of the world to resist these irresponsible actions. In particular  we call upon the United States of America to desist from supplying the Zionist aggressors with military and financial support and stop providing them with a political cover. All the world knows that without the support by all possible means given to this regime by the United States  it would not have been able to persist in its aggression. It is not our wish that the United States should be an accomplice in the Zionist aggression against the Arab nation  but its continued support for the aggressors and the political cover it provides them with makes it  in fact  an accompliceâand an active one at that.142.	The fact that the United States boycotted the International Conference on the Question of Palestine held recently at Geneva confirms United States complicity with the Zionists in their denial of the rights of the Palestinian people. Be that as it may  the Geneva Declaration on Palestine'"" has made it quite clear that the international community affirms these rights  and the Programme of Action which the Conference adopted'"" lays the sound foundations for dealing with the issue. We call upon ail Members of the Organization to do their utmost to support the Geneva Declaration and to implement the recommendations of the Conference in order to establish peace and stability in the area.143.	We also urge States  and particularly those Western States which co-operate with the Tel Aviv regime on both the bilateral and the multilateral levels  to re-examine the ethical validity of such co-operation  especially in the military and economic fields  as well as the legal basis on which it rests. While declaring that they do not give political or legal recognition to annexation by the Zionist entity of occupied Arab territory  these States deal with it in the economic  commercial and financial fields as if it were a normal entity which does not annex the territories of others by force or illegally exploit their natural resources. This kind of normal dealings with Tel Aviv will only encourage the aggressor to persist in the policy of seizing lands and annexing territories by force and constitutes an acceptance of the	situation imposed by that policy.144.	Such attitudes cannot be explained in terms of even-handedness or neutrality. When there is an aggressor who persists in aggression and who refuses to listen to the voice of the international community with regard to the restoration of justice and peace  then it is not being neutral  objective or even-handed to provide that aggressor with assistance or to deal with him by such means as allow him in fact to continue his aggression and his irresponsible behaviour.145.	We must recall here the resolutions adopted by both the General Assembly and the Security Council on the annexation by the Zionist entity of Arab Jerusalem and its declaration of that city as its capital. Any State which decides to transfer its embassy to the Holy City of Jerusalem not only encourages the Zionist entity to continue its policy of aggression  but also participates in that aggression  flagrantly challenging the rights of the Palestinian people as well as this Organization and its Charter and contributing to the weakening and diminution of the status of the United Nations.146.	Iraq supports with all its power the just struggle being waged by the Palestinian Arab people to regain its inalienable rights in its own land and its own home  Palestine. We also reaffirm our support and backing for the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian Arab people. The attitude of certain States  including the United States  which deny recognition to that organization and refuse to deal with it as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian Arab people  reflects their total partiality to the Zionist aggressors and bears no relation to the true situation in our area and in the world as a whole. Such an attitude has no legal justification. Those who are really concerned with peace and justice in our region and in the world at large should abandon that anomalous attitude  recognize the facts and deal with legitimacy.147.	There have been attempts at the political and physical liquidation of the PLO. More than a year ago  the Zionist invasion of Lebanon was undertaken with a view to liquidating the PLO and murdering the Palestinian Arab people. Sordid massacres were committed against that people  supervised and carried out by the leaders of the Tel Aviv regime and their armed forces 148.	In the West Bank there has been an acceleration of organized acts of terrorism against the Palestinian people and of attempts to have Palestinians deported from the land of their forefathers. The plans of the rulers of Tel Aviv to establish settlements in usurped Arab lands continue to be implemented. This colonial project should stop immediately. We are truly amazed at the attitude of the United States  which offers excuses for this colonial project  which is contrary to all international law  to human rights and to United Nations resolutions.149.	The time has come for the international community to go beyond condemnation of this policy and its results and to proceed to make use of the measures set forth in the Charter to thwart this colonial project and to take a stand against the policies of terror and repression carried out by the rulers of Tel Aviv against the Palestinian Arab people.150.	Needless to say  Iraq's firm position is to support the PLO and its legitimate leadership. Iraq rejects and condemns all attempts to weaken or fragment the PLO or to rob it of its political will. Whatever their pretext  such policies can only serve the purposes of the Zionist plan to liquidate the PLO and to deprive the Palestinian Arab people of its ability to express itself both by active struggle and by political means. 151.	The rulers of Tel Aviv continue today to implement their blueprint for the establishment of a Greater Israel. They are bearing down heavily on Lebanon  that small and weak Arab country  in an attempt to appropriate for themselves part of its territory. The redeployment of the Israeli forces in Lebanon is an overt attempt to maintain the Zionist occupation of substantial parts of Lebanese territory with a view to annexing them eventually to their fascist expansionist regime.152.	Since the Zionist invasion of Lebanon  the United Nations has adopted many resolutions calling for the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territory. The rulers of Tel Aviv  however  with their well-known contempt for the Organization and for international public opinion  have refused to comply with those resolutions  and they continue m occupy substantial parts of Lebanese territory.153.	We emphasize here the need to adhere to principles and to apply the international decisions relating to the preservation of the unity and sovereignty of Lebanon and preventing any party from partitioning that country through the imposition of a situation  of a capitulation or of an exchange of benefits in order to expand at the expense of this small and peaceful country.154.	Iraq hereby reaffirms its total solidarity with the Lebanese people in its efforts to preserve its sovereignty  independence and territorial unity and to impose its own independent will in the decisions it takes. Iraq will do all it can  especially within the Arab framework  to assist Lebanon and its people to achieve those aims.155.	When we call for and work towards the establishment of a just peace in our area and for our Arab people  we in Iraq are not unaware of the climate of tension that prevails in many parts of the world and of the wars raging in more than one area. The majority of such crises are caused by policies of force and hegemony  by attempts to acquire spheres of influence  by interference in the internal affairs of States and by non respect for the will of their peoples to live in freedom and peace. Worthy of attention also is the grave acceleration of the arms race  especially in the nuclear field  and the acquisition of a nuclear capability by racist entities such as South Africa and the Zionist entity. Such a capability will enable them to engage in nuclear blackmail so that they may persist in their racist and aggressive policies in Palestine  South Africa and Namibia  which continues to suffer under the illegal occupation of Pretoria. We support the struggle of liberation movements in southern Africa  which aim to secure freedom  dignity and equality for the peoples there.156.	It is necessary to call attention also to the tense situation in Central America and the Caribbean region. Based on our firm principles  we reject all forms of interference in the internal affairs of peoples and urge that solutions to the problems of this area be sought through negotiations  without the use or threat of use of force.157.	Finally  it is necessary to point to the deterioration in the international economic situation  especially that of the developing countries  which suffer from grave problems which are discussed in detail by the General Assembly every year. It is regrettable that no progress has been made so far towards solving these problems or towards easing the difficulties of the developing countries158.	The present crisis in international economic relations  with the widening gap between the developing and the developed countries  constitutes one of the gravest of problems and is a source of instability threatening world peace and security. For the first time since theSecond World War the per capita gross domestic product has declined in many developing countries  and the pieces of basic commodities have fallen in real terms to their lowest level in 50 years. The access of the exports of developing countries to the markets of the developed countries is being greatly reduced. Consequently  the revenue of developing countries from those exports has decreased  while the interest on loans to them has soared  a matter which has led to considerable deficits in their balances of payments and to substantial increases in their debt obligations.159.	The developing countries  which have born the greater part of the burden resulting from the financial crisis in international economic relations  have tried sincerely to enter into dialogue with the industrial countries. They have submitted practical and realistic proposals to find a way out of the present crisis. The best example of those initiatives is the Economic Declaration of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which contained new ideas and constructive proposals  both short-term and long-term  to deal with the international economic situation. The final document of the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held at Buenos Aires from 28 March to 9 April also contained realistic proposals and draft resolutions which were subsequently submitted to the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at Belgrade in June. But all those initiatives  as well as the desire to institute a permanent constructive dialogue  were met with rejection and inflexibility on the part of some industrial countries  and the opportunity offered by the sixth session to introduce new approaches that might serve the international community as a whole was missed as a result.160.	The present session of the General Assembly follows a number of extremely important conferences held this year which issued documents that merit serious study. This session offers another excellent opportunity for deliberations and consultations on the follow-up steps that should be taken with regard to the important proposals put forward by the developing countries. It is our hope that the industrial States will respond in a constructive spirit so that solutions may be found that will benefit all the peoples of the world.161.	As a developing country  Iraq has worked in all international forums in support of proposals to introduce structural changes in the world economy to make it more equitable. It is also the view of Iraq that international economic co-operation is a matter of the utmost importance  and no group of States  no matter how great their economic power  can alone avert the effects of the present crisis.162.	Economic co-operation among the developing countries has become an important factor in international economic relations. Iraq has made such co-operation one of the main goals of its foreign policy. This approach has been translated into practical action  as represented by the loans and concessionary assistance which Iraq has offered to other developing countries; but the circumstances created by the Iranian aggression against our country that has continued for more than three years have led Iraq to discontinue its assistance for the time being.163.	It is our hope that during this session tangible progress will be made towards finding solutions to all the political and economic problems I have spoken about  which are of interest to all mankind. "
"69",3379,"ISL",38,1983,"ï»¿  It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Illueca on his election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that his vast experience in this forum and in world affairs will be of great help to him in guiding the Assembly towards solutions of the many problems to be dealt with at this session. I am particularly pleased to see a distinguished representative from the Latin American region presiding over this session  and I sincerely hope that the United Nations will be able to contribute significantly to current efforts aimed at resolving burning issues in that part of the world. I should like to take this opportunity to welcome to the Organization the 158th Member State  Saint Christopher and Nevis. I should also like to see this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General and his staff for their unselfish but too often unrewarding efforts in helping to solve the manifold problems which beset the world community and fall within the scope of the Organization. Earlier this year  members of the Icelandic Government and government officials had the opportunity to discuss some of these questions with the Secretary- General during a most useful official visit that he undertook to the Nordic countries. Ever since Iceland became a Member of the United Nations in 1946 our participation in the Organization has been a cornerstone of our foreign policy  and this was recently reaffirmed by the new Government which took power at the end of May. In the beginning it was our hope that the Members would have the good fortune to make the Organization strong and influential enough to ensure the peaceful settlement of disputes and prevent conflicts. This hope has unfortunately not been realized  as demonstrated by the current state of world affairs. It is for this reason and because of a constant threat of war that Icelanders have been obliged to adopt a security policy based on the inherent right to self-defense  in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. More than three decades ago the Icelandic Government deemed it necessary to join NATO and to conclude a defense agreement with the United States. By doing so we joined an alliance of friendly nations which share the same ideals of freedom and democracy. We still need this alliance. It is therefore untimely  in the opinion of a large majority of my countrymen  to contemplate any change in policy in this respect. All of us look forward to the day when such special defense arrangements will no longer be necessary  but we are determined to maintain our vigilance as long as necessary while also supporting the United Nations in fulfilling the role which we originally expected the Organization to discharge. We wish to add our small but sincere contribution to the efforts to create a basis for peace and freedom for all nations. To be sure  the situation around us is not bright  and any solution seems distant. There are violations of human rights in Eastern Europe and elsewhere around the world. There is a war in Lebanon which we hope will end following the cease-fire. A war between Iraq and Iran goes on. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan continues  in spite of United Nations resolutions  and the Vietnamese still remain in Kampuchea. South Africa maintains its policy of apartheid and completely disregards decisions by the United Nations. Central America is threatened by war. And the cruel act of the Soviet Union in shooting down a Korean passenger aircraft has demonstrated the use of methods which must not be tolerated or repeated. While this state of affairs continues  it is estimated that $800 billion will be spent on armaments this yearâ which certainly could have been better used for other purposes. It is estimated that that sum of money equals the income of 1.5 billion people in the world's poorest countries. Although it is unfortunate that the United Nations has not been as successful as we originally had hoped  we must not give up. These fateful issues that concern war and peace must continually be under discussion and consideration by the United Nations in the General Assembly and the Security Council. The nations of the world must continue to consult  and arms and might must not be allowed to resolve the issues. It is particularly important for small nations like ours that the United Nations act decisively  even though it may take a long time before the rule of law and order is respected in relations between nations. The United Nations must be successful in avoiding the dangers of armed conflicts and must change its methods to resolve disputes. The difficulty lies in resolving the mutual distrust that reigns among the nations of the world. Some Statesâ fortunately fewâappear to be building up their military potential to follow up the ""policy of domination and expansion  and others  as a result of this  are compelled to take corresponding defensive measures. The crux of the matter is the increasing policies of domination and interference by States in the affairs of others  coupled with widespread disrespect for human rights and an unequal distribution of the wealth of nations. Soon the thirty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be celebrated. Recently  many of us who are gathered here agreed to the Concluding Document of the Madrid meeting  which reiterates the Helsinki Final Act 7 and adds several provisions regarding human rights  human relations and measures to ensure trust among nations and peoples. Our belief in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person is confirmed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These declarations must not continue to be a dead letter  as has been the case in most parts of the world. The gap which separates solemn obligations and their implementation must be bridged. This will best be achieved by instituting and strengthening the system of democracy  in which the rights of the individual are observed and secured and government is the servant of the people and not their master. I once visited one of the greatest zoos of the world in the company of its director. 1 asked the director which animal was most difficult to keep. Even though such an answer gives food for thought  we do not want a world where people are kept behind bars. We do not want closed borders that turn whole countries into prisons. We believe that freedom of information and human interrelations across borders remove suspicion and that democracy gives protection against those who govern. In democracies  the leaders must obtain a majority to appropriate funds for armaments  as opposed to the practice of dictatorships. Democracy '.s therefore a means toward disarmament  but democracy must not become its own undoing  while dictatorships continue their arms buildup. We must maintain our demand for mutual and complete disarmament under effective international verification. The development of the arms buildup has been such that arms reduction and disarmament will not be a simple matter. There is some argument as to how a balance may be defined and achieved in this respect. And the possibility that a scientific breakthrough in this field may alter the overall situation as did the atom bomb in the Second World War encourages the superpowers to spend huge amounts on military research and development. These facts should further demonstrate the dire need for tangible results in the ongoing negotiations between the super-Powers in Geneva relating to strategic weapons and intermediate-range missiles. We welcome indeed the new United States proposals which President Reagan explained earlier today. Now it is up to the Soviet Union to respond in a positive manner. We Icelanders base our economy first and foremost on the resources of the sea. We are therefore deeply concerned about the military buildup in the oceans. A minor mishap  not to mention any major disaster  could have the gravest consequences for our fish banks  and thus on the whole on our economy. But not for us alone. The oceans as a foodstore for mankind  millions of whom are starving  makes their preservation our common concern. Let us bear this firmly in mind and act accordingly. Iceland and the other Nordic countries  Denmark  Finland  Norway and Sweden  all regard the United Nations as having a key role to play in our efforts to improve the international situation. The noble goals set out in the Charter have as yet to be realized  but the Charter and its goals remain nevertheless valid. We  individually  must all renew our vows to fulfil in good faith the obligations assumed by us under the Charter. Some measures are also required to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to play its key role  and in particular to act effectively to halt conflicts and settle crises in order to preserve peace in the world. This last question has of late been the subject of a study undertaken jointly by the five Nordic countries. That study produced a report which was transmitted to the Secretary-General on 10 June last and  at the request of the five countries  circulated by him as an official document of the General Assembly. I shall cite here two points we consider especially important in the conclusions of this Nordic report  which we hope will be closely studied by other delegations: ""The efficiency of the Security Council should be improved. The Council should develop procedures for initiating action in an early stage of conflicts in order to prevent the use of force. The Council should also devote more attention to the implementation of its decisions. Periodic meetings of the Council in accordance with the Charter should be seriously considered. ""Relations of trust and co-operation between the Security Council and the Secretary-General are of crucial importance for the ability of the United Nations to prevent or to solve conflicts. The Secretary-General should be given all possible support in his endeavours to make full use of the role assigned to him by the Charter in this field."" Our hopes will  however  not be realized unless the atmosphere of hostility which now exists is improved. These strained relations are reflected in the work of the Security Council and  indeed  in that of the whole United Nations system  and they impede the efforts to find solutions to immediate as well as long-term problems. I have deliberately dwelt on issues that our nations and the Organization have not been able to solve. I have chosen to discuss the issues generally and on a wide basis  rather than to go into particular matters. But in spite of disappointment and near desperation over the many unresolved issues with which the world community is faced  let us not forget the progress that we have made on the issues we have been able to solve. One of the most notable accomplishments of the United Nations is the conclusion of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea signed in Jamaica nine months ago  after long and arduous negotiations. This result is a matter for great satisfaction  and it is hoped that the Convention will enter into force as soon as possible. It not only marks an end to numerous disputes over the law of the sea but offers a framework for the settlement of such conflicts. It also stands as a monument and as proof  reminding us that with patience and endurance complex problems facing the world community can be peacefully solved. As such  the Convention is a source of both satisfaction and encouragement  and holds out promise for the future. We all hope that the United Nations may prosper and grow in influence in years to come."
"70",3426,"ISR",38,1983,"ï»¿208.	 Mr. President  at the outset  permit me to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session. Since this year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Simon Bolivar  the election of the representative of a Bolivarian country to the presidency is also an expression of esteem by the international community of the ideals of Bolivar  beyond being a tribute to your nation  Panama  and indeed to the Americas as a whole. We know that your vast experience and skill will stand us in good stead in our deliberations.209.	I should also like to express our appreciation to your predecessor  the Deputy Foreign Minister of Hungary  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the able manner in which he carried out his tasks as President of the thirty-seventh session.210.	Israel wishes to congratulate also from this rostrum Saint Christopher and Nevis on its accession to independence and to welcome it on its admission to the United Nations. We wish its people peace and prosperity.211.	The official closing of the thirty-seventh session on 19 September marked the passage of yet another year of turbulence and incertitude. But as we begin this new thirty-eighth session  we see amply demonstrated once again the aspirations of Member States for peace and tranquillity  for equality and justice in our world. This  after all  should be the common denominator for all of us who have been meeting in this Hall. And yet it is a sad comment on the ingenuity of the human race that so little has been done in these last 38 autumns to go beyond the hopes invested in the United Nations in 1945.212.	New wars have been erupting perennially  some more bloody than the greatest battles fought in the Second World War  and old conflicts have continued to smoulder without let-up. Significantly  the greatest problems which have faced mankind since the end of the Second World War have been dealt with outside this Organization  although it was founded on the belief that the concert of nations can and must stand up to its trials and travails together and out of common accord.213.	It is indeed gratifying to observe the family of nations grow from year to year. We welcome new partners in our common endeavours  for the United Nations will either stand or fall on the principle of universality based on equal sharing of opportunities and burdens in a pluralistic world. But reality must not be cast aside; the United Nations is patently incapable of meeting its challenges  as it is  regrettably  an organization which has been hijacked to serve the narrow interests of those who would do anything to advance their particular and selfish causes  and theirs alone. The United Nations has become a forum of mercantile transactions of favours  of a complacent trampling of the principles and purposes of the Charter. These are the sad realities within which we liveârealities which  however  we are not compelled to accept or adopt.214.	There is today no evident correlation between the hopes of nations and the United Nations role in the realization of those hopes; no rational connection between the aspirations and expectations expressed at the beginning of each General Assembly session and the many acrimonious debates in committees and the flood of paper resolutions that emerge at the tail end of the sessions. This is not only the point of view of Israel; it has been dwelt upon by several Assembly Presidents in the past.215.	Israel  of course  has had its own share of disillusionment with the United Nations. The persistence of Israel's adversaries' hatred and rejectionism has been largely tolerated here without prohibition or hindrance  primarily because of a great transfer of wealth  gratuitous and unprecedented  from the highly industrialized nations of the West to some Arab countries and the resultant concentration over the last decade of economic influence in the hands of the oil-producing Arab nations.216.	Yet  however frustrating Israel's experience with the United Nations has seemed to be  my country has not relinquished the first flush of hope that the founding of the United Nations produced in the wake of the Second World War. Beyond its own political preoccupations at the United Nations  Israel has been observing with great concern those economic and social problems which consistently mar relations among nations.217.	Economic issues  as well as those of war and peace and arms control  have given more cause for fear than for hope in the past year. Insecurity and distress continue to afflict the greater part of humanity.218.	The deliberations on economic issues conducted between developed and developing nations  as well as those among the developing nations themselves  progress far more slowly than the rate at which these problems continue to grow. The gravity of these issues requires unrelenting endeavour.219.	Israel  for its part  is willing  within the means at its disposal  to make its contribution to the advancement of international economic co-operation. In this spirit  we have recently presented our ""transitional economy plan""  already circulated at the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The aim of the plan  which is based on Israel's own experience  is the application of low-cost improvements to the rural sectors of various societies. Dozens of developing countries and international economic organizations have already expressed their interest in advancing this programme and in implementing the ideas relevant to their needs and special circumstances. We are happy to note that some developed countries have shown eagerness to incorporate parts of this project into their own development strategy for the developing and least developed countries.220.	Israel believes in both collective and individual efforts to fight hunger on this planet and has participated actively  through its international co-operation programme  in alleviating this scourge. The United Nations system should be the central vehicle for the required international co-operation. Its ability to carry out this role efficiently must depend to a large degree on its observance of the principles of universality in participation and adherence to genuine objectives of economic development.221.	Unfortunately  we have been witnessing an ever growing attempt to politicize international economic efforts by the injection of elements of global and regional conflicts. The developing countries are ultimately the main victims of this attitude  as precious resources for development are channelled into futile and senseless exercises totally unrelated to the pressing economic needs of the greater part of mankind.222.	No less disturbing is the insufficient progress in the international handling of the arms race and security- building measures. Israel has long been concerned about the danger posed by nuclear armaments. It has  therefore  consistently supported the objective of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.223.	Israel naturally examines these problems from the perspective of the Middle East. We have concluded that the most credible barrier to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in our region would be to make the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone. To that end  Israel has made proposals based on the precepts of the Latin American model which had led to the conclusion of the Treaty of Tlatelolco.224.	It is only logical that the initiative for the establishment of such a zone should originate with the States in the region  and the preliminary consultations necessary for achieving this aim must be carried out directly among them; they should be conducted in good faith and be addressed to issues pertinent to the establishment of such a zone.225.	It is clear that only free and direct negotiations among all Middle Eastern States can ensure real progress towards the conclusion of a convention which would establish a system of mutually binding obligations on all States of the region. My delegation has been advocating this approach in the annual General Assembly debates; it introduced a draft resolution  contained in the annex to a letter dated 9 June 1981/ and formed part of the consensus on the subject. Our initiative gained wide- ranging support  and recognized leaders and experts in the field of disarmament paid tribute to Israel's position. Israel's proposal  however  was unfortunately turned down by hostile States in the region.226.	Israel is fully aware of the many political differences between the States of the Middle East. None of those differences should be permitted to stand in the way of the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Israel  for its part  stands ready to commence negotiations on this matter among the interested States of our region at any time and without any preconditions.227.	In recent years  the suppression of human rights by many Governments around the world has reached alarming proportions. It persists in all but a few countries and is in clear violation of the principles enshrined in various international treaties and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the Middle East itself  many of the Arab regimes flagrantly violate these rights by persecuting political  ethnic and religious groups and minorities; by imprisoning political opponents without trial on a widespread scale; by humiliating  torturing and  indeed  executing many political prisoners; by staging at times large-scale massacres of their own citizens  as was the case in Hama  Syria  in February of last year; and by suppressing such fundamental liberties as freedom of expression and assembly.228.	The Jewish people have known for centuries what it is like to suffer at the hands of cruel authoritarian regimes. Israel abhors such manifestations of repression. My country supports all sincere efforts to foster respect for and safeguarding of human rights. At the same time  it deplores attempts in this Organization and elsewhere hypocritically to divert legitimate concern for human rights in directions which serve objectionable and narrow political interests.229.	Unfortunately  the Soviet Union's continuing harassment of Soviet Jewry remains one of the most persistent and glaring human rights problems faced by the world today. In spite of the many international agreements to which the Soviet Union is a signatory  such as the Helsinki accord ' hundreds of thousands of Jews in that country are being systematically denied the basic human right to emigrate and to be reunited with their families in Israel. At the same time  those who have been formally denied exit permits have been forced to live as outcasts in Soviet society  often for lengthy periods  having been deprived of their means of livelihood  exposed to the whims of the authorities and subjected to all manner of harassment. In some cases  Jews who apply to leave for Israel or who seek to preserve their Jewish heritage and identity are arrested and imprisoned and languish in Soviet jails and labour camps under the most inhuman conditions.230.	Indeed  as the gates of emigration have been nearly sealed  officially inspired anti-Semitism  with the inevitable strong racist overtones  is being increasingly manifested in the Soviet media and in various forms of discrimination. Regrettably  the United Nations has yet to take appropriate action on this matter  which must distress decent people everywhere and which is certainly worthy of the Organization's attention.231.	Unfortunately  the United Nations  and the General Assembly in particular  have also done very little of a constructive nature to alleviate international tension and defuse the many conflicts which have continued to plague much of the world for several years now. The cause of neither peace nor world security has been advanced in this past year. The past year has seen the escalation of the confrontation between the super-Powers  which in turn has had grave repercussions throughout the world  particularly for the smaller nations. International tension was greatly increased when the Soviet Air Force recently deliberately shot down a South Korean airlinerâan act that was overwhelmingly condemned by the international community. Most of the armed conflicts and local wars raging around the globe year ago continue to exact a heavy toll in casualties despite destruction and suffering. In Afghanistan  Kampuchea foreign intervention continue  with hundreds of thousands having been killed or injured thus far and millions rendered homeless. The Middle East is torn apart by violent inter-Arab rivalries and by a number of conflicts  of which the Arab- Israel conflict is but one. Iraq and Iran are locked in a bitter  prolonged war which has now entered its fourth year and has already claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands. Internecine strife  encouraged by Syria  has rent Lebanon. Libya has pushed ahead with its imperialistic ambitions in Chad  while seeking to subvert also other regimes in Africa and elsewhere. Various disputes have also been plaguing the western hemisphere.232.	Although usually stemming from local factors  much of the unrest throughout the world  including the Middle East  has been sharply exacerbated by Soviet policies which have exploited tensions to generate instability and thereby broaden the scope of Soviet influence. Whether directly  as in Afghanistan  or indirectly  through such proxies as Viet Nam  Syria and Libya  the Soviet Union has  instead of contributing to world peace  aggravated crisis situations and even sparked the outbreak of hostilities. Unfortunately  this holds true also for Soviet involvement in the Arab-Israel conflict.233.	The last decade has demonstrated that the solution of the Arab-Israel conflict is indeed possible  provided that the parties to the conflict are sincere in their efforts to resolve it. Once again it must be stressed that progress in this regard was made entirely outside the United Nations. Indeed  instead of contributing to the promotion of peace in the Middle East  the Assembly and other United Nations organs have often added to the violent rhetoric which has fanned the flames of the Arab-Israel conflict. Were we to judge matters as they are reflected in these chambers  one might easily conclude that the conflict is insoluble. However  in the real world of the Middle East itselfâas distinct from the world of the United Nationsâprogress has been achieved  as we have seen in the cases of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty and in the recent Israel-Lebanon agreement. Once States engage in serious and direct negotiations which acknowledge their mutual legitimate needs and interests  agreement has been shown to be possible.234.	The United Nations  manipulated by powerful blocs and automatic majorities  has generated a basic misconception concerning the essence of the Arab-Israeli conflict.235.	The essence of the conflict has always been and remains the persistent enmity of Arab States towards Jewish national renaissance. For decades now Arab leaders have obstinately maintained that the whole region from the Atlantic Ocean to the Persian Gulf must be exclusively Arab. This intolerant and exclusivist attitude has been reflected in their repressive policies directed against various non-Arab national groups in the Middle East. This  and no other  has been the primary cause also of the ongoing Arab-Israel conflict.236.	Unfortunately  after several costly wars started by Arab States in their bid to destroy Israel  many of the Arab countries have apparently not yet realized that their designs concerning Israel are both wrong and futile. Thus  what they have been unable to achieve on the battlefield  they are now trying to achieve in the diplomatic arena. This has been demonstrated again at this podium during the last few days by the extreme language and content of the speeches made by  among others  the Foreign Ministers of Syria and Iraq.237.	Significantly and most regrettably  representatives of Arab countries habitually referred to as ""moderates"" have not objected but acquiesced. Such indeed is their ""moderation""  which should be duly taken note of by all those nations here at the United Nations which have either deliberately or  at the very least  unwittingly aided and abetted a campaign which strives to delegitimize my country in order to dismantle it by stages.238.	In the context just described  Arab enmity towards the State of Israel has been demonstrated very clearly in the case of the terrorist organization known as the PLO  an artificial framework which was created by the Arab Governments in the early sixties. That grouping of rival terrorist factions has always depended on the continued support of the Arab States and their allies for its very existence  as has been evidenced most vividly during and since the destruction of the PLO infrastructure in and around Beirut last year.239.	Too many people have resorted to wishful thinking when referring to the PLO. Smooth phrases and eloquent double-talk cannot hide the PLO's true intentions and nature. Its criminal goal remains the destruction of Israel  whether in one fell swoop or in stages. In pursuing this objective  the PLO terrorists have perpetrated bloody atrocities which have struck at all  Jews and non-Jews  young and old  men  women and children. The PLO's true character and objectives must have become evident recently even to those who in the past were taken in by PLO phraseology.240.	The continuing tragedy of Lebanon is a consequence of the havoc wreaked by the PLO and its allies over the past decade. Knowing full well the potential for subversion inherent in the PLO  Arab Governments were unwilling to tolerate the presence of this terrorist organization on their own countries' soil and  as a result  dumped that group upon Beirut and on the people of Lebanon. As a consequence  Lebanon's sovereignty was eroded and the country was tom apart by violent strife.241.	It is well known that Israel stands for the full restoration of Lebanese sovereignty  of Lebanese independence  of Lebanese territorial integrity  of the unity of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries  as well as for the restoration of the authority of the lawful government of Lebanon within that country. Israel believes that in order to permit the attainment of that goal  all foreign forces must be withdrawn from that country. Alongside these objectives  and bearing in mind the experience of recent years  Israel's legitimate security needs must also be guaranteed and Lebanese territory must never be used again for attacks upon our citizens.242.	The agreement concluded by Israel and Lebanon on 17 May 1983 is linked to these requirements. Israel was and remains determined to proceed towards full and speedy implementation of this agreement aimed at the restoration of Lebanese sovereignty. However  it must have become clear to everyone by now that Syria and the PLO have no more intention of respecting Lebanese sovereignty today than they did in the past.243.	We have all heard Lebanon's emphatic and repeated demands for the withdrawal of the Syrian forces and the PLO from its territory. At the last session  Lebanese President Amin Gemayel used this rostrum to call for ""the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all non-Lebanese forces from Lebanon"". In a letter to the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez  a year ago  Lebanon explicitly demanded the termination of the Syrian and PLO presence in that country. Lebanon reiterated its demands as recently as last month. On 2 September  the Lebanese Foreign Minister wrote to the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States insisting again on Syrian and PLO withdrawal and he repeated this demand in his statement from this rostrum during the last meeting. Yet all this has been to no avail. Not only has Syria paid no heed to these demands  but it has increased its involvement in Lebanon and is engaged in direct warfare against the legitimate Government of that country. President Assad  backed diplomatically and militarily by the Soviet Union and assisted by Palestinian terrorists  continues his ruthless operations to keep Lebanon in disarray in an attempt to force Lebanon to submit to Syrian domination. Resorting to its well-known tactics of threats and extortion  Syria continues to undermine Lebanon's path to regaining its sovereignty. This is pursued by Syria directly or by proxy  and its uninhibited brutality stops at nothing.244.	Israel's withdrawal from the Shouf Mountains  a first step in the direction of total withdrawal  was announced well in advance in order to provide the Lebanese Government and army with a chance to extend its control over that area. They were prevented from doing so by Syria and its proxies  which turned Lebanon once again into a battleground  exploiting existing enmity between groups there and encouraging all-out war against its legitimate Government.245.	Israel welcomes the fact that a cease-fire has now been declared in Lebanon and hopes that the cessation of hostilities will endure  leading to true reconciliation  free of outside interventions and dictates. We are following the situation closely and are looking forward to the establishment of conditions which will ensure security and tranquillity along the Israel-Lebanon border. Under no circumstances will Israel agree to return to the state of affairs which prevailed until 16 months ago  when Lebanese territory was used as a base for terrorist operations against our citizens. Israel sincerely hopes and wishes to see an independent Lebanon in which a strong and stable regime exercises control throughout the country.246.	Earlier  I had occasion to note that the United Nations has been systematically exploited in recent years as an instrument of Arab warfare against Israel. The most recent effort in this regard was the ill-conceived international conference at Geneva several weeks ago. As part of the manipulation of United Nations organs during the past decade by countries arrayed against Israel  that conference predictably served as an arena for anti-Israel slogans and made no attempt whatsoever to examine honestly and objectively the causes of the Arab-Israel conflict.247.	Arab-Israel reconciliation can and must emanate from direct negotiations without outside interference. There is place neither for dictated nor for imposed solutions. Any overt or covert attempts to circumvent free and direct negotiations between the States of the region can only delay the peace process. A blatant example of such attempts is the so-called Fez ""peace plan"" with its calculated ambiguity and double-talk. It is intended to serve those who wish to evade direct negotiations and seek to impose long-standing and extreme Arab demands  thereby undermining the cause of peace. Any equitable and realistic solution will have to take into account the basic fact that on the territory of the former Palestine Mandate two national States have now been in existence for over three decades  one Arab and one Jewish. I refer  of course  to the Kingdom of Jordan and the State of Israel.248.	The contribution of the United Nations and the world community at large should be to encourage discourse and dialogue rather than attitudes and trends which perpetuate and continued hostility to my country. Regrettably  the United Nations has allowed itself to be drawn into a biased position  has become entangled in a mushrooming web of unbalanced resolutions  has put itself into a straitjacket of partisan committees and has squandered vast resources and funds for dubious purposes. The time has surely come for-all to realize that a solution to the Arab-Israel conflict will be possible only if it takes full account also of the rights  interests and needs of Israel. First and foremost among these is the inalienable right of the Jewish people to self- determination and sovereignty in its homeland  the land of Israel.249.	The Camp David accords reached after intensive direct negotiations with Egypt  with the participation of the United States of America  show what can be achieved if the parties involved approach the problem in a spirit of conciliation. These accords which fully take into account the legitimate rights and interests of the parties involved  have also set the stage for a future treaty with Jordan and have offered the Palestinian Arabs living in Judea  Samaria and the Gaza district an active role in shaping their own future  initially within the framework of autonomy and afterwards during the negotiations to determine the final status of the areas in question. Anyone sincerely interested in the well-being of the Palestinian Arabs  as well as in a true peace which would take into account both the interests of Israel and those of its Arab neighbours  should welcome the progress exemplified by Camp David. By contrast  those who wish to perpetuate the Arab-Israel dispute for selfish political reasons will no doubt continue to support one-sided resolutions in this body and will seek to undermine those initiatives which have brought us closer to a genuine Arab-Israel peace.250.	Israel welcomes the voices of reason that have come out of African capitals declaring that their contribution towards the promotion of dialogue in the Middle East will be more credible and effective when their relations with both Israel and its neighbours are normalized. In the past  the potential inherent in the relations between Israel and the developing countries in Africa and elsewhere was realized in achievements which have proved useful and of significant mutual benefit.251.	Israel would welcome the resumption of ties and expansion of co-operation and friendship with all those who/believe  as we do  that all nations  whether or not they agree on every issue  should engage in mutual relations and dialogue. In our opinion these are elementary requirements if we are to advance the prospects of peace and co-operation in our world  The purposes of the United Nations  as defined in Article 1 of the Charter  are to maintain peace  to develop friendly relations between nations  to achieve international co-operation in the solution of international problems and to act as a centre for harmonizing the actions of countries. These noble purposes  to which the founders of the United Nations dedicated themselves in 1945  are ill served by the Organization's present unchecked drifting into their abandonment through impotence. Above all  the principle of the sovereign equality of nations has often been set aside in deference to the dictates of bloc politics and military and economic blackmail.252.	Despite this regrettable trend  Israel remains prepared actively to support a new  positive approach. An initial step in this direction could be the jettisoning of the heavy burden of politicization in the specialized agencies  thus rendering them as useful and efficient as they were meant to be.253.	Israel still believes that the dim record of the past must not cloud our belief in the future. The Government of Israel is prepared today as it has always been to negotiate with the neighbouring Arab States an equitable solution to the Arab-Israel conflict.254.	From this rostrum I wish to address myself to the Arab peoples of our region and to inquire whether 36 years of war and bloodshed have solved any problems. Are we better off as a result of so many years of conflict than we would have been had our nations lived side by side in peace? Could not the billions squandered on arms procurements have been put to better use in solving urgent domestic problems  such as poverty  hunger  illiteracy and a widening social gap between rich and poor? For how long will your governments be able to divert your legitimate concern with social injustice by pursuing hostile policies against my country  policies which can only perpetuate the violence which has cost our societies so much? Indeed  for how long will your Governments be prepared to sacrifice the flower of youth on the bloody altar of war?258. Continued hostility and war have brought our region much grief and suffering. Would it not behave us to begin a new chapter in the history of our troubled region? Would it not be better for us to turn the Middle East into an area marked by co-operation and progress? Thousands of years ago from our region went forth a vision of universal peace. Together we could fulfil that vision in our region and be a source of inspiration to the rest of the world. Therefore let us meet in a spirit of reconciliation. Let us replace tension with tranquillity  misery with prosperity  hatred with friendship. Above all  instead of war  let us have peace."
"71",3473,"ITA",38,1983,"ï»¿173.	 We are approaching the end of another year that has not been favourable either for international society or for the Organization which is its highest universal embodiment.174.	Wars and areas of crisis and zones of tension and instability still form the dramatic and alarming setting of our planet. The efforts of the United Nationsâand in particular those of the Secretary-General  which deserve our appreciation and supportâto overcome crises by means of negotiation have unfortunately not borne the fruits looked for by the international community.175.	Yet in the past few decades we have witnessed an extraordinary evolution in the international community. This Hall bears eloquent witness to the fact that all peoples in the world  not merely those from certain privileged regions  have become aware of the respect they owe to themselves and of their right and duty to contribute to international dialogue.176.	The family of nations is seeking to adjust to this state of affairs amid difficulties  tensions and wars  in a continual and impassioned striving to achieve peace within a system of equality  order and security guaranteed by universally respected treaties.177.	The most meaningful and telling changes concern three areas which are today of fundamental importance: disarmament  economic relations between industrialized and developing countries  and human rights.178.	- Progress that should not be underestimated has been made in the major negotiations on disarmament  even though for the time being it has been mainly confined to the conceptual Held. Only a few years ago it would have been illusory to talk of reduction rather than only limitation of nuclear armaments. Today the two most important and difficult sets of negotiations in progress at Geneva  the negotiations on strategic arms reductions and the talks on intermediate-range nuclear missiles  are being conducted with a view to achieving drastic cuts in the nuclear arsenals of the Soviet Union and the United States.179.	Italy is directly concerned in these negotiations and is actively contributing to the formulation of Western positions. The Italian Government is convinced that an equilibrium in intermediate nuclear forces between NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries is essential to security and stability in Europe and hence in the world as a whole. This applies in particular to long-range weapons  whose deployment  initiated by the Soviet Union as far back as 1977  has destabilizing implications which seriously concern my country.180.	We consider that the negotiations should continue without any time limits or arbitrarily imposed deadlines. In contributing actively to the joint elaboration within the Atlantic alliance of the Western negotiating positions at Geneva  Italy has always thought it necessary to take account of the Soviet security concerns that seem reasonable.181.	I should like to recall that at the twelfth special session last year  devoted to disarmament  I had the honour to make a statement here on behalf of the InterParliamentary Union an organization broadly representative of the world's parliaments.182.	We listened with great interest to the address by the President of the United States  which we appreciated for its open-minded approach and for the constructive attitude to the validity of this Organization  which served to stop the controversy that recently arose on the subject.183.	We noted in particular the confirmed readiness of the United States to undertake negotiations and the new United States proposals on Euromissiles  which indicate great flexibility. To us these proposals seem likely to encourage a favourable negotiating climate.184.	In spite of expectations  however  the first reply given by the Soviet Union unfortunately does not seem to be a positive one. Nevertheless we hope that Moscow will reconsider this latest proof of the West's desire for an understanding and will abandon certain unacceptable preconditions that still constitute the main obstacle to an agreement.185.	Although the United Nations is not directly involved in these discussions on a general level  it has none the less consistently promoted disarmament debates  which have ultimately had a great influence.186.	The true test of the Organization has been its will to promote equitable and verifiable agreements in the important areas covered by the Committee on Disarmament. Given the careful attention that Italy has always paid to these issues  I refer in particular ?o the preparation of a convention for a total and verifiable ban on chemical weapons and to the exploration of the problems involved in the prevention of an arms race in outer space.187.	We attach equal importance to progress towards a treaty for a complete ban on nuclear tests  while fully appreciating the complexity of the paramount issue of verification.188.	The proliferation of regional crises and conflicts raises again  as a matter of growing urgency  the problem of conventional disarmament and the need to halt the massive drain on resources essential to development. We therefore hope that it will be possible to activate the Vienna negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions  which have important  though indirect  implications for the security of my country.189.	The Geneva talks could well have been adversely affected by the inadmissible destruction by Soviet fighters of a South Korean civilian aircraft  with serious loss of life. This event caused profound shock throughout the world and was deeply deplored by Italy  which also spoke in the debate in the Security Council. We pay our tribute to the innocent victims  and we consider that their families are entitled to adequate compensation from those responsible. We also believe that  at the forthcoming special session of ICAO  every effort should be made to improve the international rules governing air transport.190.	The importance of air links between the different countries of the world for international coexistence and for understanding between peoples is obvious. Every effort must be made to prevent the emotion caused by this incident from setting back the international dialogue.191.	New peoples  new independent and sovereign States have brought about a new reality  rich in its variety of components  which is certainly very much alive and progressive but also complex and not without contradictions.192.	In this context my country regards very favourably the different regional and non-regional groups that have come into being and looks forward to seeing them strengthened. I have especially in mind the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which was given significant new momentum by Mrs. Gandhi and other important leaders at the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held recently at New Delhi. I am thinking also of the Organization of African Unity  of the Organization of American States and of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  with which the European Community has established close and fruitful relations. Those groups are trying to channel and represent internationally  outside the established blocs  the aspirations and needs of peoples with common historical  social and cultural roots.193.	The crisis resulting from the growth of the international community has direct economic effects  which are particularly severe in the case of the developing countries. Italy confirms its responsible and confident participation in the development and success of the North- South dialogue  which as been delayed for too long. 194.	Solving the problem of underdevelopment is fundamental to the achievement of peace. In keeping with the guidelines laid down by the United Nations  Italy is actively stepping up its own policy of co-operation for development.195.	First of all  decisive action is needed in the international field to reduce progressively the debt burden of countries with difficulties. Secondly  more balanced trade rules are needed to encourage exports from developing countries. At the same time  the flow of resources for development aid  which certainly plays a very important role  especially for the poorer countries  must be maintained and increased.196.	Italy's co-operation effort is motivated by its belief that man should have the central role in development  going beyond the purely commercial or charitable approach. We aim to implement the principle of solidarity  realizing that  in a world of increasing interdependence  individual progress is achieved through collective progress.197.	The fight against hunger and malnutrition is thus a prime purpose of Italy's action to help the most needy countries meet their most immediate food shortages.198.	The Italian commitment to the children of the developing countries remains a matter of the highest priority. The ever closer co-operation between Italy and UNICEF is the prominent feature of this commitment. That co-operation is especially encouraged by the substantial progress in the ""health revolution"" to benefit children  initiated last December by UNICEF with the support of the Secretary-General and many other well- known individuals.199.	Along those lines  and despite its difficult economic situation  Italy has been steadily increasing its appropriations for co-operation with developing countries  from $750 million in 1981 to the $1.6 billion already allocated for 1984. For the current year  two thirds of that amount are for bilateral assistanceâapproximately half in the form of grantsâand the remaining third for multilateral assistance.200.	That effort provides the clearest evidence of the Italian Government's firm commitment to co-operating with the relevant agencies and United Nations programmes.201.	A positive change that has had a growing impact on international life in recent years has been the internationalization of human rights problems  originally considered an internal matter of each State. This change is undoubtedly due to the fact that human rights are solemnly proclaimed in international instruments of great importance and universal scope  starting with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.202.	However  that internationalization of human rights has not led to an equally significant progress as regards their application and observance in everyday life by all the members of the international community.203.	Yet I believe that most of the conflicts and tensions in the world of today  besides their various political motivations  nearly always stem from the behaviour of States which break the fundamental rules of human rights and the rights of peoples.204.	This year we are again regrettably obliged to mention the continuing events in Afghanistan. The Italian Government reaffirms its full solidarity with the position of the great majority of the international community in firmly condemning the Soviet occupation.205.	Nor has Italy forgotten the restrictions on trade unions options and associations still in force in Poland  even after the abolition of martial law  restrictions that in Europe rightly arouse the solidarity of peoples who share the same culture.206.	Foremost among the political crises having humanitarian aspects is the Arab-Israeli crisis  whose focal point is the Palestinian problem and the problem of Israel's security.207.	In that controversy it seems increasingly difficult to revive the favourable prospects offered by the proposals made on I September 1982 by the President of the United States"" and by the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  held at Fez?âprospects which the 10 members of the European Community have sought to enhance  in harmony with the positions stated by them at the meeting of the European Council at Venice in 1980.""208.	Although they differ on important points  the Reagan plan and the Fez Declaration do not appear irreconcilable. For those two approaches to a solution to converge  efforts must be made to start a political dialogue and a negotiating process leading to mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO  which Italy has repeatedly advocated.209.	The dialogue initiated between Jordan and the PLO was linked to that requirement. It is thus a matter of regret that it has been stopped  and we hope that the groundwork will be laid for its reactivation  arduous as that task may appear today.210.	The Italian Government considered the developments in the Lebanese situation  before the cease-fire just announced  particularly serious. We hope that the sufferings of the Lebanese people  already so sorely tried  have come to an end. We also hope that a phase of national reconciliation may begin  through a dialogue between President Gemayel's Government and all representative Lebanese forces. To the achievement of that truce  for which the United States and Saudi Arabia worked so intensely and which was supported by Damascus  Italy made a contribution through diplomatic efforts exerted jointly with the two European Community countries  France and the United Kingdom  which are part of the peace force.211.	We stand firm in supporting Lebanon's requests for the withdrawal of all foreign forces still occupying that country. The Israeli-Lebanese agreement of 17 May  reached after over-long and arduous negotiations  could have constituted  and perhaps still can constitute  a first step towards pacification. It must  however  be promptly put into effect in the Held and must be followed by agreements which  while respecting the various legitimate interests  including those of Syria  will result in the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.212.	The cease-fire will probably need outside support  through the deployment of observers. It is our wish that this measure may be undertaken within the framework of the United Nations. Italy is prepared to consider making a contribution.213.	The Italian contingent serving with the multinational forceâestablished a year ago  for urgent humanitarian reasons  when it proved impossible to reach a decision on the deployment of a United Nations forceâ and the Italian helicopter contingent attached to UNIFIL are there in the interest of restoring Lebanon's sovereignty and independence with full respect for its democratic traditions and the diverse interests of the communities of that country  as well as to help protect the civilian population.214.	We view with deep concern the continuing conflict between Iraq and Iran  two countries with which Italy has long-standing ties of friendship and fruitful co-operation. Three years of strife and bloodshed have resulted in thousands of victims and dire destruction and have diverted for military purposes enormous resources and energy  which are indispensable for the progress of the Iraqi and Iranian peoples.215.	The war has also brought insecurity to the Gulf region  which is vitally important to oil routes and of enormous significance to world stability. Renewed efforts must be made to end the hostilities and to pursue a course of peace and negotiation  with full respect for the political and cultural identity of both parties.216.	Italy is bound by strong ties to the countries of Latin America. We are  therefore  sensitive to all events on the continent  and at this time we are particularly concerned about developments in Central America  where disturbances and conflicts  although deriving from local problems of development and social justice  could become a permanent element of the East-West problem. I should like to reaffirm Italy's readiness to contribute to the-success of any initiative designed to lead to political solutions and thus avoid military options.217.	With reference also to the views expressed in the recent Cancun Declaration. I wish to point out that the increased levels of offensive weapons in the area  foreign intervention  traffic in weapons and hostile propaganda campaigns are not conducive to peace  nor will they restore the right of the peoples of Central America to live and work constructively and to exercise independent political choices. There is a pressing need to allow people throughout the region to pursue freedom in a climate of respect for human rights. Democratic development must also entail and guarantee  among other things  genuine pluralism and the removal of the economic and social inequalities that have plagued those peoples for so long.218.	For some months now an important peace initiative has been going on among the four countries of the Contadora Group  an effort that is receiving growing approval from the members of the European Community. The Italian Government has expressed  and intends to confirm  its support for that action.219.	South America is no longer torn  as it was last year  by the Anglo-Argentine conflict  which can never be sufficiently deplored. The great Argentine nation  with which Italy has strong fraternal bonds  is about to regain its place among the democratic nations  in keeping with its great cultural traditions. Concerning the problem of the Falklands Malvinas  Italy's position continues to favour a resumption of the dialogue between London and Buenos Aires  without any preconditions regarding the subject of the dispute. This dialogue should take place within the framework of the United Nations and with the valuable assistance of the Secretary-General.220.	Italy views with great favour and encourages the democratic developments and movements to bring about economic and social emancipation in many countries of South America. Unfortunately  this positive evolution is often accompanied by serious and intolerable violations of human rights  which must be stopped. We are thinking of Chile and its people  who have our whole-hearted solidarity.221.	In Africa too we are  unfortunately  witnessing proliferation of sources of tension and trouble spots.222.	Although the crisis in Chad stems from internal tensions  the decisive intervention of an external destabilizing factor has had a dangerous multiplier effect. The Italian Government fully supports the negotiating initiatives of the OAU.223.	Italy also believes that adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and those of the OAU could help to settle the conflict in the Horn of Africa  a region with which we have special ties. Ethiopia and Somalia must find a way to engage in dialogue and co-operation. Italy is firmly committed to these objectives  among other things through co-operation programmes which it intends to develop further.224.	Efforts to open the doors of independence to Namibia  in accordance with United Nations decisions  have made further  but slow  progress. We hope that the necessary trust between the parties will be strengthened in this final phase so that southern Africa may be protected from the reverberations of world tensions.225.	In this connection it also seems to us to be necessary to take a more resolute stand against the intolerable phenomenon of apartheid and to support the United Nations firmly in the role it can play.226.	Concerning the Asian continent  the Italian Government views as unacceptable the continued occupation of Cambodia by Viet Nam  in flagrant violation of the principle of self-determination. In this case too Italy can only reiterate its hope for a speedy political settlement  in keeping with the relevant United Nations resolutions and the growing expectations of the great majority of Member States.227.	As regards the position in north-eastern Asia  and particularly in the Korean peninsula  we are in favour of maintaining the existing balance  considering the fundamental importance of that area for world peace. Italy  therefore  hopes that the Korean question may be solved by peaceful means  through direct negotiations between the two parties  without outside interference.228.	Italy believes that the community of nations must respond to the present international difficulties with closer  more productive co-operation  both within regional associations and within the universal framework of the United Nations.229.	The process of European integration is a fundamental point of reference for Italy  convinced as we are or its irreplaceable function in the development of the civilization of our continent. Europe must consolidate and strengthen the recognized role it plays on the international scene in favour of peace  development  social progress and respect for human rights. Therefore we feel that an important step was taken with the adoption by the European Council  meeting at Stuttgart in June  of the Solemn Declaration on European Unionâof which the United Nations has been notified on the initiative of Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany. This declaration is a valuable contribution to the achievement of the objective of increasing unity of action among the 10 European countries concerning  among other things  their responsibilities to the outside world. We look forward to another political event of fundamental importance which Italy favours  the entry into the European Community of two countries with great traditionsâSpain and Portugal. This will undoubtedly contribute to expanding the Community's ties with peoples of other continents.230.	After three years of slow and painstaking negotiations  beset by crises  the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe ended on 9 September with the unanimous adoption of a final document prepared by the neutral and non-aligned countries. The document  even if it cannot be considered entirely satisfactory  contains the elements necessary to foster the development of security and co-operation in Europe  taking into account also responsibilities to countries outside our continent.231.	In a region very close to us there is a continuing crisis situation  a particularly anachronistic one in our opinion  which worries us especially as Mediterraneans: that is  the question of Cyprus. The two communities on the island are unable to find a form of coexistence that would consolidate the unity of that State. We support the action of the United Nations Secretary-General  including his most recent initiative  designed to achieve  by means of intercommunal talks  an institutional settlement equitable and acceptable to both sides.232.	Although close regional co-operation between States is the first step towards reconciling diverging positions in the political  economic and social Held  the international community is still identified with its highest universal embodiment  the United Nations.233.	The warning concerning the shortcomings of the Organization  put forward in the report on the Work of the Organization submitted by the Secretary-General at the last session  has given us all cause for profound concern. We have understood the message and agree that it is necessary to make adjustments that can revitalize the principles of the Charter  principles which we still hold valid today and which  in our opinion  should not be changed.234.	Strengthening the United Nations system and a more dynamic role for the Organization to which we are proud to belong will be possible only through closer collaboration between Member States. I am not referring only to co-operation in the economic Held  vital though it is. We look to a broader concept of co-operation in political  economic  social and cultural fields.235.	In this context  a Conference of the Interparliamentary Union will be meeting at Seoul in a few days' time to discuss the possible strengthening of the United Nations through the action of national parliaments. Italy will do its utmost to ensure that the Conference leads to concrete results.236.	In the quest for peace and international co-operation  this great assembly of peoples remains more than ever the natural and irreplaceable forum. It was in this forum that 38 years ago nations great and small resolved to join in a solemn undertaking: ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and ""to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person""."
"72",3519,"JAM",38,1983,"ï»¿142.	We meet during a period of fearful uncertainty and acute apprehension. The past is no comfort  the present is grim and the future holds little promise. A major share of the responsibility for this ominous state of affairs is attributable to the continued instability and deterioration in the relations between the major Powers. The trend today is towards a hardening of positions  increasing suspicion  mutual distrust and open hostility. International security and cooperation are rendered increasingly precarious  while problems at the regional level assume more complicated dimensions.143.	In this atmosphere  the General Assembly is honoured to have as its President one who brings to the office outstanding qualifications  including a wealth of experience in international affairs and proven competence which has carried him to high office in the service of his country. Your election  Mr. President  is also a tribute to the reputation and prestige of your country  Panama  in international affairs.144.	The Jamaican delegation extends its appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Hollai  Deputy Foreign Minister of Hungary  who has carried out his responsibilities with admirable competence and effectiveness over the past year.145.	The United Nations has in recent days accepted the membership of a sister Caribbean State  Saint Christopher and Nevis. We welcome that membership and extend our fraternal greetings to the Government and people of Saint Christopher and Nevis.146.	More than ever today the world needs the kind of statesmanship which seeks understanding  promotes accommodation and encourages confidence among nations. More than ever today we need to strengthen the multilateral institutions which exist to serve that process. The United Nations and associated multilateral institutions are the product of a historical experience.147.	Forty years ago good will and good sense prevailed as the world prepared itself for the painful reconstruction that would follow the Second World War. The world community  moved by the waste and destruction of the period  created in the United Nations an institution of reason and hope for the future. The Organization thus embodies both idealism and rationality as well as the instinct for survival. It is the comer-stone of our modem efforts to build an era of peace and prosperity. It is our attempt in good faith to shut the door of history on chaos and war.148.	In recent times there has been a questioning of the value of our United Nations institutions and a marked tendency to avoid or disregard the available multilateral arrangements for handling specific matters. We have noted the novel attempts at peace-keeping in Lebanon  the efforts to undermine the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the failure to launch the global negotiations for international economic co-operation. There are those who would retreat from multilateralism to myopic bilateralism at the very time that problems have assumed such a character that they require solution or treatment through multilateral arrangements. Those signs  which Jamaica views with utmost concern  should not be ignored. They represent the beginnings of a drift that could lead to confusion and anarchy.149.	Jamaica  a small non-aligned country whose security must necessarily be in upholding the principles of the Charter  reaffirms its faith in the United Nations as the best hope for mankind. In a world sharply divided by contending forces and conflicting national interests  the United Nations system provides the best available means for reaching enduring solutions to the critical problems through collective efforts.150.	We recognize that a perfect institution was not created at San Francisco. But the fact is that the imperfections of the United Nations have very little to do with the value of the Charter or with the relevance of the principles and ideals which form it. This institution is based on the recognition that  despite differences in ideological systems  in size and power  in culture  in wealth and resources  common bonds of humanity and a wish for peace and economic progress bind us all. It must necessarily be weakened  therefore  by the naked  uncompromising pursuit of national interest in the Security Council and elsewhere. It will be weakened by the sharpening of the East-West confrontation  by the barely disguised and unequal tug-of-war between North and South  and by the increasing triumph of histrionics and polemics over debate and discussion.151.	Jamaica believes that the effective functioning of the Organization  particularly in periods of crisis  requires that Member States strive for common ground and not retreat to extreme and uncompromising positions.152.	We are gravely concerned that the fragile post-war consensus on the fundamentally interdependent nature of the international community is in grievous danger of splintering. Given the lessons of the past and the technology of the present  the consequences are unthinkable. The Organization and its Members can have no task more important than that of recovering and strengthening that early consensus.153.	Undoubtedly  the crisis we now face in the world economy and the continuing inability to devise effective solutions are in large measure the result of the retreat from the spirit of San Francisco and that early acknowledgement of our interdependence.154.	This has been more difficult to recognize in the economic than in the political sphere. For one thing  devastating and powerful weapons capable of crossing continents in a few minutes have jointly carried the political message of interdependence in a way that economic forces  slowly working their way for good or ill through the global economy  have not been able to do.155.	In addition  it has only been in the past 30 years that almost the entire continents of Asia and Africa and much of the Caribbean have joined the family of the United Nations as independent States. They have thus been drawn more fully into the international production and consumption.156.	When we look at the present role of the developing countries in the international economy  the facts speak for themselves. Today  more than 40 per cent of the exports of the United States  the European Economic Community and Japan go to developing countries. An estimated 60 per cent of the world exports of major agricultural and mineral commodities  other than oil  originate in developing countries. These are some of the linkages Yet  regrettably  this obvious mutuality of interests has not sunk in as much as it might in the developed world. The mind-set of the past sometimes persists; policies lag behind events  and Governments of the North  as well as the multilateral economic institutions  need perhaps to demonstrate more that they recognize that we must now either sink or swim together.157.	I use the metaphor deliberately  for the developing countries are now in sore need of a lifeline. The level of our indebtedness has continued to rise and now exceeds $600 billion. On the average  over 20 per cent of the export earnings of the developing countries must now be set aside for the purpose of meeting debt payments. For some countries  the critical debt-service ratio is much higher. To compound matters  private lending  which has assumed an increasingly important role in international financing  has virtually dried up in 1983. Indeed  we should not be in error as to the real role of that private lending in recent years. Many countries of the South have been desperately treading waterâborrowing not to move ahead  but simply to keep from going under. The developing countries will be in debt for the foreseeable future. Debt is a condition of development and thus debt management  in the long term  is an aspect of development.158.	Jamaica has no particular interest in presenting the Assembly with a catalogue of woes. We do not believe that given the hard economic reality of the dayâover 32 million unemployed in the industrialized countries- there is any point in special pleading. Nor do we believe that we should expend too much of our energies in rattling skeletonsâreal or imaginedâin the cupboard of our past. Jamaica is devoting its energies to trying to earn its way in the world. We are a small nation  our people are courageous and hardworking. However  we cannot ignore nor underestimate the obstacles which we find in our path. Neither can we escape the conclusion that bold measures of reform are required in the international economic system to assist the economic growth and development of countries such as my own.159.	Let me illustrate. In Jamaica we have implemented a structural adjustment programme which is intended  among other things  to establish a more internationally competitive economy. Important aspects of that adjustment programme include the transformation of the manufacturing sector from import substitution to export orientation and the revitalization of our agricultural sector. We are indeed serious about carrying out structural adjustment in our economy and about maintaining financial stability through prudent management  but our economic growth requires a swift and sustained expansion of international trade and the revival of our foreign exchange earnings.160.	We cannot help but be seriously concerned  therefore  that in 1982 world trade declined by two per cent  when a mere decade ago  in 1973  it grew by 12.5 per cent. We must be greatly concerned that the export prices of the commodities of developing countries fell by 25 per cent over the period 1980-1982. Indeed  in 1982  the unit value of some agricultural exports  such as sugar  declined by 35 per cent or more. While there is some evidence of a slowing down and possible reversal of this trend  the shock waves caused by declining commodity prices are still being felt throughout our economies.161.	These are some of the cold and discomfiting facts of the international economy. When  in addition  we note that private lending has virtually dried up  that official development assistance continues to fall short of both targets and needs  that multilateral economic institutions are having great difficulty in increasing and replenishing their resources  and access to those resources by developing countries is being made more difficult  that no net increase in direct foreign investment took place in 1982  and when  finally  we contemplate the inevitable trade-off at some point between increased austerity and political and social stability  we are surprised and perplexed that some members of the international community do not appear to appreciate fully the dimensions and implications of a continuation of the present crisis for an interdependent world economy and for international peace and security.162.	Jamaica is  aware that there is a growing sentiment that some form of recovery in the North is on the way. We welcome the first signs  however faint and however difficult they might be to read and interpret at present. However  what we genuinely fear is that the locomotive of recovery will stall in its tracks or will not be strong enough to pull the developing countries and the world out of the worst recession in 50 years. We must therefore ask: why gamble everything on the recovery? Why gamble with the standards of living of peoples and the political and economic stability of countries? Why not act immediately and purposefully to ensure a broad-based and sustained recovery through parallel and bold support for multilateral economic institutions  and through concrete measures of reform which address vital and urgent needs of the developing countries.163.	The Final Documents of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries and the Buenos Aires Platform  included well-founded and relevant proposals intended to address the dual problem of world economic recovery and world development. The limited progress at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should not deter the developing countries from continuing to pursue these important proposals.164.	In this context  I should like to emphasize that Jamaica considers it vital that both IMF and the World Bank should play much larger roles both in providing credit and in offering guarantees by which private lenders can extend longer term credit to developing countries. This requires that the resources of these institutions be increased as a matter of priority. We hope  therefore  that the increase of quotas under the Eighth General Review of Quotas of IMF will come into force as quickly as possible and before the end of 1983. We also firmly believe that a substantial additional allocation of special drawing rights should be made as a quick means of stimulating growth in liquidity in the international system. This would allow an expansion in credit resources for the financing of trade and production. Jamaica certainly does not believe that  sensibly managed  this would be inflationary.165.	Finally  we welcome the clearly growing interest within the international community in taking action on some of these matters that is shown in particular by the various recent proposals for the convening of an international conference in the area of money and finance.166.	My delegation hopes that there will be progress on the question of launching global negotiations at this session of the General Assembly. The issues related to money and finance  to international trade  to commodities  to energy and to development financing that would be addressed in these discussions are long-term and structural ones  and they will not go away with economic recovery.167.	As we appeal to the North to recognize the fact of economic interdependence  consistency and self-interest require that developing countries redouble their own efforts to strengthen economic ties among themselves. In this spirit we in the Latin American and Caribbean region have been meeting together to find ways to alleviate the burden of the recession on our economies. But action at the regional level or among developing countries as a whole can only be a complement to and not a substitute for international efforts. The facts of the recession confirm this important truth. We recall that during the 1970s trade among the developing countries increased more rapidly than their total trade. However  in the past two years  as the recession has deepened  trade among developing countries has begun to contract faster than total trade. I need only add that approximately one third of the membership of the Group of 77 now operates under some form of IMF programme.168.	If there is such a thing as historical responsibility  then let it mean that the international community  particularly those members of it that wield political and economic influence  should take action now to ensure that international conditions become more hospitable and institutions more effective in dealing with the world's problems and inspire new confidence in multilateralism.169.	One area in which such an effort is sorely needed is that of arms control and disarmament. The arms race is an immense burden on the world's economy. Reliable estimates indicate that annual expenditure on arms has now reached a staggering $800 billion. These billions are procuring new generations of nuclear-weapon systems with highly sophisticated electronic devices capable of destroying the world several times over. The urgent need today is to limit further technological development in nuclear weapons. A comprehensive test-ban treaty  which has been the primary goal of disarmament efforts for over two decades  becomes more necessary and urgent as a first step in the process of nuclear disarmament. Pending the conclusion of agreements in that area  Jamaica supports as an interim measure the adoption of a moratorium on nuclear testing and a freeze on further production of nuclear weapons.170.	We cannot  however  ignore conventional weapons  which are an important component in the arms race and which account for all the death and destruction in contemporary conflicts. Their importance is equally reflected in the steady and considerable growth in the arms trade. It should be clear to all nations that the accumulation of weapons cannot bring true security and that the challenge of development and the welfare of our peoples should be given first priority in the use of the world's resources.171.	In the Middle East international attention is directed to the unfolding drama in Lebanon. A deeply complex situation of internal divisions and foreign presence with intricate linkages contributes to continued fighting. There is a dangerous potential for a wider conflict. We welcome the recent cease-fire and sincerely hope that it will provide an opportunity for the interested parties to resolve their differences through constructive discussion. The Government of Lebanon must have the full support of the international community if it is to achieve genuine national reconciliation and restore the country's unity and territorial integrity. The immediate preconditions for the realization of these objectives are undeniably the cessation of all hostility in the country and the prompt and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces that are in Lebanon not at the explicit request of the Government of Lebanon.172.	At the same time the deeper roots of the Middle East crises should not be disregarded and the search for a permanent and just solution should continue to be a matter of high priority on the international agenda. Jamaica continues to believe that the Palestinian question lies at the very heart of the problem of that region  and it is essential that a just solution be found if peace is to prevail. It is also essential to bring an end to the regime of foreign occupation and to require that Israel withdraw from the Arab territories occupied since the 1967 war. These elements were recently underscored at the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva last August  which highlighted the issue that must be faced  namely  the recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people.173.	All States in the area  including Israel  are entitled to exist within their internationally recognized boundaries.174.	The same principle of the right of a people to self- determination is central to the problems in southern Africa. Another year has passed without any progress made towards ending the illegal occupation of Namibia and fulfilling the hopes of the Namibian people for self- determination and independence. Neither the activities of the contact group nor the policy of constructive engagement has brought any worthwhile results. As the Secretary-General's report has made clear  the introduction of the concept of linkage  which Jamaica has always rejected  has caused incalculable damage to the prospects for the implementation of the plan adopted as long ago as 1978J South Africa has been given a further opportunity to pose as a co-operative party while at the same time using every device to obstruct and delay. Further  the concept of linkage has caused disarray among the Western contact group and has certainly undermined its effectiveness and unity of purpose.175.	Elsewhere in the region  the South African regime continues to be a menace to peace and a source of aggravation  destabilization and aggression aimed at neighbouring States. South Africa is using its military strength to terrorize its neighbours into submission to its will and subservience to its interests. Inside South Africa itself the oppressed majority continues to suffer under the bondage of the racist system of apartheid. The much-heralded new constitutional proposals are really only a further refinement of the system of white domination.176.	In all of this the international community needs to bring greater pressure to bear on South Africa. Jamaica will continue to do its part until the hated system of apartheid is completely eliminated.177.	On the Asian continent a number of problems remain unresolved. In South-East Asia foreign intervention and its consequences have led to persistent conflict and are the source of tension in relations among States in the region. In North-East Asia the question of the future relations between the two Koreas requires some attention. We feel that the need exists for dialogue between the two sides and a spirit of accommodation in settling outstanding issues between them. We sympathize with the bereaved families and Government of the Republic of Korea on the dastardly assassination of Government Ministers and others at Rangoon on 9 October.178.	In Western Asia we observe with sadness the continuation of the war between Iran and Iraq  with its increasing toll of human lives and economic infrastructure. We see some scope for further diplomatic activity  especially through the Secretary-General  as part of an intensified effort to bring an end to the conflict.179.	For a variety of reasons  the turmoil in Central America is a matter of the utmost concern not only for the States of the region but  equally  for the international community. In our view decades and even centuries of poverty  social inequalities  neglect and economic underdevelopment have in more recent times been further aggravated by foreign interference and intervention in that region. The intensive diplomatic activity of the Contadora Group of countries represents a genuine effort to bring an end to the fighting and to promote peaceful negotiations among the parties involved. The efforts of this Group continue to have Jamaica's full support. The Cancun Declaration on Peace in Central America [zl/3#/30.3] and the Document of Objectives s contain important and constructive measures which we are convinced could  if implemented  significantly overcome much discord and tension in the region. We note in particular that account has been taken of the need for a long-term programme of economic and social development of the countries of the region and of the necessity for some way to monitor the implementation of the commitments undertaken.180.	When the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Law of the Sea a year ago  a new chapter was opened on the possibilities for international co-operation. This is a truly remarkable achievement which deserves the fullest support of the international community. The Preparatory Commission  which is charged with the responsibility of implementation of the Convention  met twice during this year. Although progress was slow to begin  Jamaica is satisfied that the procedural groundwork is now laid for advancing the substantive work of the Commission in the coming year. We urge that in the meantime all States give their support to this Convention through early signature and ratification and active participation in the important work of the Preparatory Commission.181.	Jamaica has always given full support to the United Nations activities for the promotion of human rights around the world. The process of removing discrimination against traditionally disadvantaged groups has gone a far way  particularly in the areas of elimination of racial discrimination  discrimination against women and protection of the rights of the aged  children and the handicapped. We expect that  in working out arrangements for the protection of the rights of other groups such as migrant workers  the United Nations will be successful.182.	On the broader front  we are well aware that the violation of human rights continues to take place with increasing frequency in many parts of the world. We are all too often confronted with reports of summary and arbitrary executions  torture  involuntary disappearances and denial of basic political and civil rights. This is a situation which cannot be tolerated by the international community. The realization of the intrinsic dignity and innate equality of all human beings is an indispensable precondition to the strengthening of international peace and security.183.	The major responsibility for promoting and protecting human rights clearly rests within the national jurisdiction of sovereign States. But the international community cannot always accept the principle of non-interference in internal affairs as a justification for inaction and must act resolutely to oppose human rights violations wherever they occur.184.	Against that background  my delegation continues to believe that some organ should be created within the United Nations system to investigate human rights abuses and deal promptly with serious cases of such violations. The establishment of a post of high commissioner for human rights  which my Government fully supports  could be an important instrument to combat future human rights abuses.185.	Sober reflection and enlightened self-interest point to closer international co-operation and more imaginative collective effort. We who are ready to place our faith in prudent management and sound policies  in the courage and ingenuity of our peoples  need not be transfixed by history. The responsibility for human suffering  for poverty  for insecurity is now ours. We must act to eliminate them now."
"73",3565,"JOR",38,1983,"ï»¿145.	 It gives me pleasure to convey to the President my warmest congratulations on his election to this high office. His election is a tribute to the prominence of his country in world affairs and a testimony to his experience and competence.146.	I should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor for the skilful manner in which he conducted the work of the last session.147.	It is also a source of satisfaction to pay tribute to our distinguished Secretary-General  especially for his important report on the work of the Organization.148.	I wish to congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on its independence and accession to membership of the United Nations.149.	The world situation gives rise to great concern. The current world economic crisis is affecting all countries. Its adverse impact is particularly felt in the developing countries  with the result that some had zero growth rates and others negative growth rates. The developing countries are facing mounting deficits in their balance of payments  resulting from a decline in the prices of their exports through the collapse of raw material prices  from the increase of protectionism  and from an increase in the prices of their imports  in addition to the heavy financial burden of servicing their foreign debts. The situation has been further aggravated by high inflation and unemployment in those countries. In the light of these facts  it is imperative to take immediate measures to enable the developing countries to overcome this acute crisis. Such measures must include the stimulation of international trade  increase in borrowing  aid and financial transfers  preferably on soft terms. We are confident that prospects of an economic recovery in the developed countries will have positive impact on the world economy; however  we do not consider this to be a substitute for the adoption of such immediate measures. Moreover  it is imperative that such measures be accompanied by the commencement of global negotiations in order to establish the new international   economic order on the basis of justice and equity for all. It goes without saying that the spirit of understanding and the notion of interdependence among nations should be the basis of such negotiations.150.	Regarding world peace and security  the picture is yet more bleak. While none of the old conflicts has been resolved  new ones have arisen. In addition to the continued Israeli aggression against the Arab nation  including the latest invasion of the sisterly State of Lebanon  the war between Iraq and Iran  the situation in Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Korea  Cyprus and Chad and the problem of Namibia and southern Africaâin addition to all these  the situation in Central America has appreciably deteriorated this year. Equally threatening is the increase in tension between the East and the West  especially between the two super-Powers  with the result that detente has diminished  only to be replaced by cold-war policies.151.	This tension in world affairs is regrettably accompanied by disregard on the part of some countries to their obligations under the principles of international law and the provisions of the Charter  especially those principles pertaining to the threat or use of force  the peaceful settlement of disputes  non-interference in the internal affairs of others  good-neighbourliness  and respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States. Still more alarming is the lack of desire and enthusiasm on the part of Member States to follow the path of multilateral negotiations in order to devise satisfactory solutions to the imminent and formidable problems which are facing us. While the absence of progress towards reasonable solutions is a source of concern in itself  the lack of will and desire to continue the pace of collective endeavours is more frightening and more puzzling. It certainly constitutes a set-back to the principle of cooperation and interdependence which should prevail in international relations and among the peoples.152.	I need not remind the Assembly that  while this state of affairs causes concern about the fate of humanity  it represents a challenge to the Organization. The Organization was established to save the world from the scourge of war and to be the source of moral authority  as has been stated in one of the important speeches which we have heard already from this rostrum. However  let me add that this moral authority will be ephemeral unless it is translated into legal and political authority. We notice that States which have been granted special privileges in accordance with the Charter do not adequately fulfil their obligations towards the Organization. This has led to the emasculation of the United Nations  particularly the Security Council  and eventually to the withering away of its moral authority.153.	Since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 more than 100 wars and conflicts have broken out  for none of which has the United Nations been able to provide any real solution. Even when the Organization succeeded in taking certain decisions concerning any of those conflicts  its decisions have remained unimplemented  due to the inability to invoke the powers and authorities provided for in the Charter  which has led some countries  especially small peace-loving countries  to lose faith in the ability of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security and has forced them to seek security in regional alliances and international56. The widespread use and threat of use of force in international relations  accompanied by the weakening of the United Nations  have subverted the system of collective security. This state of affairs has been further endangered by the tendency of some countries to define their national vital interests in an unlimited manner  which makes the maintenance and protection of those interests a source of friction between States. We note with regret that this situation has adversely affected the United Nations as an instrument for the resolution of conflicts. In particular  the Security Council  which has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  has been demoralized and rendered ineffective. We find also that States entrusted under the Charter with special responsibilities and privileges have pursued a policy of selectivity in the Council  ignoring their obligations under the Charter. A concomitant result of such practices has been the weakening of the Council and a lessening of its effectiveness and prestige. More seriously  it has encouraged the adoption of such selectivity by others  thus becoming reciprocal.157. The most glaring example of this sad state of affairs is to be found in the Middle East  where a true reflection of the deterioration in the world situation is evident. Apart from the common use of force and aggression in the area  one can easily sense the immobility and paralysis of the United Nations. The situation there has been further complicated by the resurgence of East-West rivalry  to the detriment of the legitimate interests of the peoples and States of the region. Consequently  those legitimate interests have usually become subordinated to the interests of the super-Powers and their global schemes. The responsibility for this dangerous situation lies to a great extent with Israel  whose policies have condemned the area to a state of continuous war and tension. The underlying cause of this situation lies in the fact that Israel has defined its national interests in terms of mythological ideology  putting into the service of those interests a formidable military power. That military power has been basically sustained by foreign support  for 37 per cent of Israel's military budget in 1982 was provided by a single country. Hence the Middle East problem comes down to the fact that one State in the region has unlimited objectives and uses unlimited power for the realization of those objectives. Accordingly  Israel's military might is employed towards achieving hegemony over the whole area and gaining predominance in the region.158.	Naturally  peace becomes incompatible with such policies and with Israel's central objective  which is to annex the occupied Arab territories. As a prelude to this annexation  Israel is striving to evacuate the indigenous Arab population from those territories. For that purpose  the Israeli occupation authorities have embarked upon a series of illegal policies and practices which run counter to human rights and are designed to create certain economic  social and political conditions and consequently psychological conditions in those territories which the population there will find unbearable and which consequently will force them to leave their homes to Israeli settlers. This policy includes the training and arming of the Israeli settlers whom Israel entrusts with the task of terrorizing the Arab inhabitants through attacks on their lives and their religious and civil institutions. Israel believes that it could dissociate itself from the legal and political responsibilities for these horrendous acts by claiming that they are the work of individuals. Israeli settlement activities have transcended Israel's pretensions to security  which were in the past used to camouflage its creeping annexation of the occupied Arab territories. We are now witnessing the implantation by Israel of its settlers inside cities and other densely populated areas like Nablus  Al-Khalil and Jerusalem. Of course  when security pretexts are no longer adequate  mythological ones are always available.159.	Israel's settlement activities are the instrument of its continued occupation of the Arab territories. In addition to the fact that they represent a continuous increase in the size of Israel  those settlements have forced Israel into undertaking military crusades and pre-emptive strikes against its Arab neighbours. Since Israel's settlements have been established in occupied Arab territory  the inhabitants of which are bound to oppose them  Israel has sought to expand its security zone through the creation of cordons in the territories of neighbouring Arab States. Thus the alleged security needs of Israel's settlements have become detrimental to the sovereignty and national security of those States.160.	It follows there from that Israel's military operations  its occupation of additional Arab territory  its persistence in upsetting power configurations in the area and its efforts at dispersing Arab defence capabilities are the main functions of Israel's settlement policy. Decisive and immediate action is needed to stop this colonial policy if we are to arrest its dangerous escalation in the occupied Arab territories. Israel's frenzied efforts to change the demographic  geographic and economic structure of the occupied territories must also be halted. The world community must deter Israel from implementing the canal project linking the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean  which was approved by the Israeli Cabinet on 24 August 1980 and work on which was inaugurated on 28 May 1981. Such a project  if implemented  would irreparably damage Jordan's vital interests. It would also be in contravention of the norms and principles of international law  especially those pertaining to the fundamental rights and duties of riparian States and to occupation by force.161.	In pursuance of its policy of removing the traces of its occupation and its aggression against the Palestinian people and as a complement to its settlements policies  Israel has recently reactivated an old plan to demolish the camps sheltering the Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the West Bank  claiming that this is a humanitarian act  whereas the real purpose of the plan is to force the Arabs to leave their native soil and find refuge elsewhere. This measure is also designed to do away with something that reminds the world of the problem of Palestine  namely  the existence of 2 million Palestinian refugees  many of them still in camps in the West Bank and Gaza. This scheme coincides with recent appeals for concentration on the humanitarian aspect of the Palestinian question  thus ignoring and excluding its political aspects. It also coincides with efforts to liquidate UNRWA by curtailing its services  in particular by suspending rations to the refugees.162.	As far as Jordan is concerned  the search for a political solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is the comer- stone of its foreign policy and the principal goal of its diplomatic endeavours at both the Arab and the international levels. In contradistinction to Israel's policies  which are designed to prevent peace  Jordan sincerely supports all efforts and initiatives that increase the chances of genuine peace. Consistent with this policy  King Hussein headed the Committee of Seven which emerged from the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez  and was entrusted with presenting the Arab peace initiative to four permanent members of the Security Council. The plan  which was endorsed by the Arab heads of State at the Fez Conference  represents a positive contribution and a collective Arab effort based on international law and on the principles recognized by the United Nations  especially by the Security Council  for a political settlement in the Middle East. As a supplement to this discourse and in pursuance of Jordan's peaceful policies  we decided to build on what was achieved at Fez in 1982 as well as on other political initiatives  especially those which include a mechanism for implementation. To this end  we have recently engaged in substantive consultations and contacts with several parties which are directly concerned with the Arab-Israeli conflict  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]. Although those contacts did not develop in the way we had hoped  Jordan will continue to support and encourage every effort that could lead to the salvation of our people and the liberation of our land from Israeli occupation. The realization of this goal is a cardinal principle of our domestic and foreign policy.163.	The Geneva Declaration on Palestine of 7 September  is based on all international political initiatives relating to the Arab-Israeli conflict  in particular those possessing a valid legal base and machinery for implementation. It is an important international move towards the achievement of a political settlement of this conflict. The International Conference on the Question of Palestine at Geneva set out the principles which Jordan has always considered to be the basis for an international consensus on the achievement of a just and lasting peace. These principles include the following: Israel's total withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories on the West Bank  including Jerusalem  and from Gaza and the Golan Heights; recognition of the inalienable rights of the Arab Palestinian people in Palestine  their homeland; and the right of all States in the region to live in peace within internationally recognized boundaries. However  Israel has ignored these peace endeavours and has worked hard to foil them.164.	We firmly believe that Israel would not have been able to persist in its intransigence and continue its policy of expansion had the United Nations  especially the Security Council  been able to fulfil its responsibilities in an effective manner and to invoke the powers provided for in the Charter. Moreover  this intransigence on the part of Israel and its refusal of all peaceful and objective initiatives could not have continued had the superpowers  in particular those directly concerned  shouldered their responsibilities. Israel's faits accomplis the occupied Arab territories and in the area generally have been overlooked.165.	The credibility of any peace initiative depends on its clear acknowledgement of the illegality of Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories. It must also firmly oppose Israeli practices which include deliberate plans to evict the indigenous population from the West Bank and Gaza.166.	Those schemes  which we have seen beginning to be carried out in certain cities in the West Bank and Gaza  are jeopardizing the national security of Jordan and affect other neighbouring States as well. Moreover  they diminish peace prospects. Failure to comprehend the far-reaching effects of such a situation would constitute a fatal blow to all opportunities for peace in the region and would seriously diminish the validity of any international peace endeavour aimed at resolving the Palestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict.167.	A major obstacle to the peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict is the incompatibility of the words and the deeds of some. The drastic imbalance of power in the Middle East  and in particular Israel's quantitative and qualitative military superiority  have enabled Israel to persist in its intransigence and aggression.168.	Jordan  which has shared all aspects of the plight of the Arab Palestinian people  is more aware than others of the deep implications of this plight. We recognize the significance of the humanitarian aspects of the Palestinian problem  especially those pertaining to the daily sufferings under the occupation and the worsening living conditions of the Palestinian refugees  but we do not believe that the settlement of such issues alone can be a substitute for a political solution. Such a solution should take into account the national and historical rights of the Arab Palestinians to their homeland  Palestine. The faits accomplis created by Israel in the occupied Arab territories  and recently in Lebanon  one third of whose territory Israel occupies  should induce us all to respond adequately in order to put an end to this grave situation.169.	Lebanon has become an arena of conflict between foreign interests. In Lebanon today we witness accounts being settled and spheres of influence being drawn. But  above and beyond this  Israel seeks to keep Lebanon in total disarray so as to stifle Arab potential. This would also serve as a smoke-screen for its designs to judaize and swallow up  gradually and discreetly  the West Bank and Gaza. Therefore  we caution against allowing the tragedy of Lebanon to be used as a vehicle for finalizing Israel's colonization policies in the West Bank and Gaza and other Arab territories occupied in 1967. Consistent with our concern at the dangerous implications of the situation in Lebanon and its obvious adverse effects on Arab rights in Palestine  we support all effortsâespecially those of the Government of Lebanonâwhich aim at ensuring the independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon; and we call upon everyone to refrain from any action that would prolong the agony of the Lebanese people and could be used by Israel as a pretext for continuing its occupation of southern Lebanon. We appeal to the international community to support Lebanon's endeavours to ensure Israel's withdrawal from its territory and put an end to all practices violating Lebanon's sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity and detrimental to the unity of its people. In this context we welcome the cease-fire achieved recently in Lebanon  towards the realization of which Jordan contributed modest but sincere efforts. We also support all Arab and international efforts aimed at the preservation of Lebanese sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity.170.	The continuation of war between Iran and Iraq amid an atmosphere of international indifference is a matter of deep concern. This war  which has now entered its fourth year  is continuing to cause bloodshed and destruction and is draining the resources of both countries. This is causing Jordan pain and grief  and we should like to reiterate here the imperative need for the international community to halt this war and provide a solution on the basis of international law and principles of justice and equity.171.	An objective look at this war indicates very clearly that Iraq has accepted and worked for an end to the hostilities and has withdrawn its forces to its internationally recognized borders with Iran. On the other hand  Iran insists on continuation of the war and has repeatedly attacked Iraqi territory  ignoring Iraq's calls for a ceasefire and a peaceful settlement of the dispute. Iraq has demonstrated its peaceful intentions by accepting the verdict of the international community and going along with Security Council resolutions addressing the conflict. Furthermore  Iraq has co-operated with the representative of the Secretary-General  the mediation efforts of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. While appreciating Iraq's positive response to these peace efforts  we call upon Iran to reciprocate and respond favourably  in the interests of both countries and peoples and the region as a whole.172.	The situation in southern Africa is not very different from the one prevailing in the Middle East  since it is the result of similar aggressive policies of the Government of South Africa against neighbouring African States. The racist Government of South Africa continues to practise its	policy in spite of world condemnation. However  mere condemnation without effective action has enabled South Africa to continue to obstruct the achievement of Namibia's independence and to block the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). In this respect  we emphasize the need for the Security Council to assume a more effective and decisive role in securing Namibia's independence. We call upon the United Nations to condemn the collaboration between Israel and South Africa in various fields  particularly the military and nuclear. Such collaboration poses a threat to the regional security of Africa and international peace and security as a whole.173.	The continuation of violence and tension in Central America is severely endangering the region's stability. To avoid any further escalation of violence  we stress that polarization and internationalization of the conflict must be avoided and we urge a political solution. Such a solution would enable the peoples of the region to devote their energies and resources to addressing their economic and social needs  which are at the core of the problems affecting the region. We therefore welcome the efforts of the Contadora Group and express the hope that it will be able to contribute to a solution on the basis of its various relevant declarations. We also call for the implementation of United Nations resolutions pertaining to Afghanistan and for respect for the rights of all peoples to self- determination and to the expression of their national will in conditions of total freedom.174.	Jordan calls for the solution of the problem of Cyprus by peaceful means  through intercommunal talks under the auspices of the United Nations and within a framework that would preserve the independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of that country.175.	We support the solution of the problem of Korea by peaceful means through negotiations between the two parts of Korea  in accordance with the joint communique issued in July 1972.176.	In conclusion  Jordan  which has to bear the brunt of Israeli aggression  reiterates its determination to cooperate in all sincere and objective efforts to achieve a comprehensive  just peace without forfeiting any of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine to the land of its forefathers. We shall always accord the highest priority to the deliverance of that people and the territory from Israeli occupation. We call upon everyone to shoulder their responsibilities before it is too late and request that this Organization match its words with deeds. "
"74",3612,"JPN",38,1983,"ï»¿91.	 On behalf of the Government and people of Japan  Sir  I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session. I am confident that  given your wealth of experience and wise views  this session will prove fruitful indeed. Please be assured that the delegation of Japan will spare no effort in co-operating with you as you carry out your important tasks.92.	At the same time  I wish to express my deep appreciation to the President of the thirty-seventh session  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the very capable manner in which he discharged his awesome responsibilities.93.	I also take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General. As we begin the second session under his leadership  I am most encouraged by his determined efforts and capable leadership  despite the tense international situation.94.	It is a great pleasure to be able to extend a sincere welcome to Saint Christopher and Nevis as the 158th State to be admitted to the membership of the United Nations.95.	It is most regrettable that I must begin my formal remarks at this meeting of an organization devoted to the pursuit of peace and international harmony by speaking of the recent downing of a Korean Air Lines jetliner by the Soviet Union. Allow me here  on behalf of the Government and people of Japan  to express my sadness at the passing of the 269 passengers and crew members who were the victims of one of the most tragic incidents in history and to convey my heartfelt sympathy to their families.96.	The shooting down of an unarmed and defenceless civilian aircraft is an intolerable outrage against humanity and international law. Not only has the Soviet Union failed to provide a satisfactory explanation of events to Japan and the other countries concerned; it has desperately sought to shift the blame for this incident on to others. 97.	I strongly urge the Soviet Union to respond to the verdict of international condemnation of this grave illegal act and duly recognize its responsibility  as well as to deal with this situation promptly and with sincerity.98.	Despite the fervent wishes and determined efforts for peace by the peoples of the world  there is not a day that goes by without anxiety and concern. The world situation continues to be plagued by tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and between East and West  conflict and disputes in some regions  global economic recession which invites protectionist movements  and more.99.	Under its peace constitution  Japan has long made its basic foreign policy one of refusing to become a military Power and of contributing to world peace and prosperity  and in full recognition of the heightened international expectations that Japan play a more positive political role in the world community  we are resolved to continue to make every effort to contribute to world peace and stability commensurate with our national strengths and position.100.	Of course  the various problems in the international community cannot be resolved by any one country acting alone. They demand concerted action by all the countries of the world  and it is precisely in the United Nations that these international problems should be studied and concrete policies for their solution debated.101.	From this perspective  I should like to speak today on Japanese foreign policy efforts  with particular attention to the issues before the United Nations  and also to outline future directions.102.	It goes without saying that disarmament is the issue of greatest concern to Japan  a country determined not to become a military Power and firmly maintaining its three non-nuclear principles. Our generation has a grave responsibility to save the world from the tragedy of war  especially from the scourge of nuclear weapons  and to pass it on intact to posterity.103.	My Government therefore attaches primary importance to the negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces now under way between the United States and the Soviet Union. The success or failure of these negotiations not only will have a major impact on the strategic arms reduction talks and disarmament negotiations in general but will also have a crucial influence on the overall international situation  including the fate of East-West relations. The Soviet SS-20 missiles  the subject of these intermediate-range negotiations  greatly affect the East- West military balance by virtue of their range  mobility and destructiveness  and they cannot be ignored in the context of world peace and security. Although the Soviet Union has taken the position that the present negotiations only cover the SS-20s deployed in Europe  these negotiations must be conducted from a global perspective  including the Asian region.104.	Japan has long emphasized that the intermediate- range nuclear forces negotiations should be conducted and a solution sought  not by sacrificing Asia  but from a global perspective by paying due consideration to the security interests of that region. I have accordingly taken every opportunity  including my trip to Europe in January and my attendance at the Summit of Industrialized Nations at Williamsburg in May 1983  to argue this position and to seek the understanding of the United States and other countries concerned. This Japanese position met with the agreement of the major industrialized countries and was incorporated into the political statement of the Williamsburg Summit.105.	Given the gravity of the worldwide impact which the outcome of these negotiations will have  I sincerely hope that prepress toward a substantive solution will be made in the future. Japan appreciates and supports the serious efforts of the United States  as seen in its recent initiative  and at the same time I strongly urge the Soviet Union to respond in good faith and approach these negotiations realistically for the sake of world peace.106.	With the risk of global nuclear proliferation growing as it is today  it is all the more important that we strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons regime. As one of the contracting parties to this Treaty  Japan would like once again to call upon all countries that have not yet adhered to this Treaty to do so as soon as possible  whether they possess nuclear weapons or not.107.	At the same time  I should like to point out that it is especially important for the maintenance and strengthening of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regime that the nuclear Powers faithfully fulfil their responsibilities for nuclear disarmament under this Treaty  and so I call again upon the United States and the Soviet Union to make substantive progress in their disarmament negotiations.108.	Japan has long opposed nuclear testing of any kind conducted by any State ant: has worked to promote the establishment of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty  including underground testing  in order to halt the further upgrading of nuclear weapons  and we must continue untiringly our international efforts in this field.109.	The realization of credible disarmament in both nuclear and conventional weapons demands the establishment of verification systems for each disarmament measure. Recognizing this  Japan has consistently stressed the importance of verification in the disarmament Held.110.	Japan suggested a number of concrete measures to this end at last year's second special session devoted to disarmament  including the establishment of an international verification unit within the United Nations framework/ and I hope these Japanese measures will be promptly implemented.111.	If verification is to be effective  it is important to promote the disclosure of a broad range of information regarding military affairs and disarmament. It was in this spirit that the system of standardized reporting for military expenditures was established under resolution 35/142 3  adopted in 1980. Japan hopes as many countries as possible  regardless of their different social systems  will report on their own military spending in accordance with these standards and so lay the foundations for spending reductions.112.	With these dements as our basic approach  Japan has made every effort to promote disarmament. I assure you that Japan is resolved to continue to play a positive role for disarmament to enhance global security and hence to create a brighter future for all mankind.113.	In June I attended the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  at Belgrade. The North-South issue debated there is a theme about which both sides have been concerned and on which they have worked together for a solution. At root  world peace and prosperity cannot be achieved  at this time of increasingly interdependent relations  without efforts by both the North and the South and without cooperation based upon these efforts. The struggles of the developing countries for economic development can be rewarded with success only in a sound international economic environment and only with the support of the industrialized countries. Likewise  economic growth in developing countries will stimulate efforts for economic revitalization in industrialized countries.114.	I am convinced that the vitality of the countries of the South in a variety of pursuits is indispensable for the world as it enters the twenty-first century  and I feel very strongly that fostering that vitality requires that we create an international climate in which the people who live in these countries can believe that their lives are better today than they were yesterday  and that they will be still better tomorrow.115.	Although there have recently been signs of recovery in the world economy after a prolonged recession  there still remain numerous destabilizing factors such as unemployment and protectionism in industrialized countries and debt problems in developing countries. If we are to resolve these issues  both the industrialized and the developing countries must renew their commitment to work untiringly to solve the problems confronting them.116.	It was for this reason that I stressed at Belgrade that each country must do its part  the industrialized countries working to revitalize their domestic economies  further open their markets and expand and improve their official development assistance  and the developing countries promoting courageous adjustment efforts responsive to their present economic difficulties.117.	I should like to take this opportunity to express my admiration for the zeal with which Yugoslavia  as host of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  strove to achieve a North-South accord.118.	As an industrialized country itself  Japan is taking the initiative in seeking to fulfil its responsibilities. In the management of its economy  Japan is striving to achieve sustained growth without inflation. It decided to raise the generalized system of preferences ceiling on industrial products by approximately 50 per cent  to about $5 billion  for next year in an effort to open its market. It has also been endeavouring to meet its new medium-term target  which is to double its official development assistance over a five-year period.119.	Great numbers of people in those least-developed countries which have been left behind in global economic development are suffering and on the verge of starvation  and it may be said that we have a humanitarian responsibility to the international community to extend special assistance to these countries. As well as working for the faithful implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries  Japan intends to make further efforts to expand its assistance to these countries and to extend it on a grant basis as far as possible.120.	The Common Fund for Commodities is one concrete example of international co-operation in support of the self-help efforts of the developing countries. Japan has already taken the initiative and agreed to contribute over 8 per cent of the funding for this Fund  but I should like once again to urge that all countries which have not yet ratified this Agreement do so as soon as possible so that the Fund may become operational.121.	In addition  it is imperative that the industrialized countries strive to fulfil the promise of Belgrade and work systematically to reduce and eliminate those protectionist measures which inhibit the expansion of the world economy. We must also see to it that the seventh replenishment of the International Development Association is achieved at a substantial level in order to secure the funding needed for development.122.	It is necessary that we steadily implement the international co-operation which was pledged at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. I believe that such international co-operation is a responsibility to be shared by all members of our increasingly interdependent international community  whatever their social or economic systems. The North- South dialogue will proceed one step at a time on the basis of such co-operative action. In this connection  it should be recognized that the launching of the long-pending global negotiations should be one step in the search for common ground.123.	The basic aim of Japanese foreign policy is to contribute to world peace and prosperity by playing an active role in promoting constructive dialogue of this kind. Especially now  when there is so much concern about the tension on the international political scene  I believe that we should choose amity over animosity and co-operation over confrontation  that we should rally behind the elimination of poverty as the common goal of all mankind  and that we should come to grips with the historical imperative of North-South co-operation.124.	I should like next to touch upon the international situation which forms the context of the important issues which I have just discussed.125.	Today  the area where conflict and dispute between countries and peoples has intensified and where the situation is the most unsettled is the Middle East. This is especially true in the Gulf region  where the armed conflict between Iran and Iraq is dragging on and where there is concern that if the introduction of new offensive weapons results in a widening of the conflict  the peace and stability of the region may be irrevocably damaged  with immeasurable ramifications for the entire world. Profoundly concerned about this situation  I visited Iran and Iraq last August and strongly urged the leaders of both countries to refrain from any action which would result in an escalation of hostilities  and to strive for an early peace. Fortunately  Japan maintains very friendly and co-operative relations with Iran and Iraq and strongly hopes for the further development of its friendship with both countries as well as for their stability and prosperity. Having gained a full understanding of their respective positions through my talks with the leaders of these countries  I feel that for the settlement of the conflict it is necessary that the just and legitimate grievances of the countries concerned be remedied. In this connection  Japan attaches importance to the report on the United Nations mission dispatched to inspect the damage to civilian areas in the two countries.126.	I would emphasize that no country can be indifferent to this conflict and that all countries should refrain from any action which might invite its escalation. Moreover  I strongly hope that the Security Council  which is responsible for maintaining international peace and security  will take effective measures to resolve it. Japan will continue to work on its own to create a climate conducive to peace  and at the same time it will spare no effort to co-operate with the constructive efforts of the United Nations for an early settlement of the conflict by peaceful means.127.	Japan has been concerned over the oil spill from the Nayruz oil-field  and I sincerely welcome Iran's successful capping of one of the damaged wells and its halting the outflow in response to expressions of concern by the international community. Japan very much hopes that the other damaged wells also will be capped as soon as possible  and we are prepared to extend all possible co-operation to this end.128.	Turning next to Lebanon  Japan sincerely welcomes the cease-fire recently agreed upon by the various forces there  and we should like to express our profound appreciation to Saudi Arabia and to the United States for their mediation efforts. I earnestly hope that this cease-fire will be the first step  in a spirit of national reconciliation  towards the restoration of Lebanese sovereignty  the re-establishment of domestic order and the withdrawal of all foreign military forces.129.	It is truly regrettable that the unsettled situation in Lebanon and the Gulf area has lately absorbed our attention and that the need for a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East has been neglected. I should like to urge all the parties concerned to redouble their efforts towards peace in the Middle East.130.	It is already nearly four years since the Soviet Union launched its military intervention in Afghanistan. We cannot allow the situation to become a fait accompli. Japan has high regard for the efforts made by the Secretary-General's personal representative. However  it is regrettable that these efforts have not resulted in an immediate withdrawal of Soviet forces  the quick restoration of the Afghan people's right of self-determination and a safe and honourable return home by Afghan refugees.131.	In recent years Japan has steadily expanded its assistance  purely on humanitarian grounds  to the refugees resulting from local conflicts  and we intend to continue such assistance in line with this basic policy.132.	Asia continues to be calmer than other regions  but the problem of Kampuchea remains unresolved. In late June this year l visited refugee camps near the Thai- Kampuchean border and saw for myself the dire conditions in which these refugees live. We must put an end to this situation as soon as possible. I should like here to reiterate my appeal that Viet Nam enter into negotiations in response to the call for a comprehensive political settlement  including the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the exercise of self-determination by the people of Kampuchea.133.	Continuing to support the efforts of the members of ASEAN towards a solution of the Kampuchean issue  Japan intends to deal positively with this situation.134.	On the Korean peninsula tensions still persist  but the settlement of the Korean question must be achieved by peaceful means  and this requires the actual resumption of dialogue between North and South Korea. In this sense  Japan highly values the initiatives taken by the Republic of Korea to bring about dialogue. The Government of Japan will spare no effort in trying to create a climate conducive to the relaxation of tensions in the Korean peninsula. Believing that there is also considerable room for the Secretary-General to play a role here  I both look forward to and will support all his efforts.135.	I strongly urge the Republic of South Africa to abolish its apartheid policies. I also hope that the question of Namibian independence will be resolved at the earliest possible time.136.	As shown in this brief review  the global community is today beset by dangers that could easily lead to a world crisis with one wrong move  and equilibrium is just barely being maintained. Yet all the peoples of the world devoutly hope that the fragile foundation will be consolidated and lasting peace and prosperity secured throughout the international community. Is it not the duty of all leaders assembled here today to respond to these hopes?137.	I should also like to take this opportunity to say a word about our relations with the Soviet Union  one of our most important neighbours. Japan has long hoped to work for the development of a stable relationship with that country based upon genuine mutual understanding. However  it has not been possible for our two countries to conclude a peace treaty because of the existence in Japanese-Soviet relations of the unsettled Northern Territories issue. Moreover  an extremely regrettable situation has arisen in recent years as the Soviet Union has deployed and strengthened its military forces in Japan's Northern Territories. Japan strongly calls upon the Soviet Union promptly to rectify this situation and come to the negotiating table to resolve the Northern Territories issue  to conclude a peace treaty with Japan and hence to begin work on building a bilateral relationship of trust.138.	The United Nations was founded after the Second World War  which had caused immeasurable destruction and suffering to all mankind  in the determination to band together to maintain peace and security and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. It is now incumbent upon us to renew that determination by returning to the ideals which inspired the establishment of the United Nations.139.	In this context and as the Secretary-General has emphasized in this year's annual report  we must recognize that the capability of the United Nations to meet the world's hopes for peace and prosperity depends fundamentally upon the will and the efforts of individual Member countries. The United Nations cannot succeed in discharging its peace-keeping functions without the active support and co-operation of all Member States.140.	In recent years there has been a conspicuous tendency for the United Nations and its associated organizations to engage in non-essential  non-urgent and sometimes duplicative activities. If the United Nations is to retain the confidence and support of Member States for its activities  given its limited financial resources  efforts must be made towards further rationalization. Serious efforts  particularly by the Secretariat  are needed more now than ever before  since many Member States are making great sacrifices in their own efforts to bring about administrative and fiscal reform.141.	It is easy to bemoan the functional enervation of the United Nations and to draw up a list of its operational difficulties and the limitations of its capability.142.	However  it is also true that the United Nations has compiled a proud record of achievement on behalf of world peace and prosperity in the 38 years since its founding. We have a grave responsibility to pass on to future generations not only the brilliant achievements of the United Nations but also an even more effective and more vital Organization.143.	Japan would like to pledge  together with all other Member States  its rededication to the revitalization of the United Nations  reaffirming its own international responsibilities.144.	The questions of war and peace have been considered eternal throughout human history. Since ancient times  people have lived either in intervals of peace between wars or in intervals of war between peace  and this fate seemed unavoidable.145.	However  even though we cannot yet eradicate from this earth a certain level of hostilities  the international community has now entered a time when it is virtually inconceivable that the super-Powers  possessing destructive capabilities equivalent to more than I million Hiroshima-type atomic bombs  would mobilize ail their resources and engage in a war of annihilation. Nevertheless  there is still that one-in-a-million chance that such a war may be started  and we must employ every conceivable means to prevent it. At the same time it is imperative that we discover ways to establish and maintain lasting peace.146.	This is an unprecedented concept for mankind  and its realization will not be easy. Yet if we fail to meet the challenge of our times we shall run the risk of falling into spiritual despair and the madness of nuclear war  thus putting an end to the history of mankind.147.	There are well over a hundred nations in the world today. Moreover  there is great diversity among countries  and no two are dike. The maintenance and development of this international community in sound harmony is the ideal of Japan's Peace Constitution and the way to secure lasting peace.148.	The fundamental goal of both the East-West dialogue and North-South co-operation should be the discovery of ways and means of ensuring such a lasting peace.149.	In closing my remarks here today  I should like to express my confidence in the success of the diverse activities which are taking place throughout the world to this end and to affirm that Japan is resolved to make every effort to do its share in accordance with the principles and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. "
"75",3684,"KEN",38,1983,"ï»¿104.	 I begin my statement on a sad note  by mentioning the tragic incident that claimed 16 Korean lives  including those of four Cabinet Ministers  on 9 October in Rangoon. On behalf of the Government and people of Kenya  I convey our profound feeling of sadness and our condolences to all the families of the victims and to the Government of the Republic of Korea. We strongly condemn such acts of terrorism and political assassination. We sincerely believe that such acts will not solve anything and therefore deserve strong global condemnation.105.	Now let me join other delegates who have spoken before me in warmly congratulating you  Sir  on your election to your high and onerous office. Your election is proof of the confidence placed in you personally and in your country by the General Assembly. I wish you all the best in guiding the work of the thirty-eighth session to a successful conclusion. On behalf of my delegation  I assure you of our fullest support in your endeavours to discharge the heavy responsibilities of the presidency.106.	Further  I wish to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  who with singular distinction led the General Assembly successfully through the thirty-seventh session. We owe him a debt of gratitude for his efforts and the wisdom he displayed at all times.107.	This is also a fitting occasion for me to pay tribute to the Secretary-General and the entire staff of the United Nations for the work they continue to do for the international community through the United Nations system.108.	It is with great pleasure that I extend our sincere welcome to Saint Christopher and Nevis as the 158th Member of the United Nations. The admission of this country is a further step towards the final universality of the Organization.109.	I wish to reaffirm the sentiments of my Government as expressed during the thirty-seventh session. The guiding spirit of my Government  under the leadership of President Daniel Arap Moi  is based on peace  democracy and justice to all under the rule of law  in a system which recognizes the supremacy of Parliament. Another fundamental objective of the Government is improving the economic and social welfare of our people in unity  freedom and love for one another. All our actions on the domestic front  as well as in the international arena  are geared to promote  project and vigorously defend these objectives. Our people are resolved to ensure that our present population and future generations enjoy the fruits of peace  unity and stability  while respecting the dignity of individual freedom.110.	As we gather here today  we cannot help looking back and taking stock of the Organization's achievements and failures. We are certain that when the balance sheet is drawn up  the results will be unmistakably on the side of success.111.	The central role and objective of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security. Whenever threats to this objective and obstructions to its realization have arisen  the General Assembly has always exerted maximum pressure in favour of peace  tranquillity and mutual understanding. It is Kenya's sincere hope that the ballots cast in the Assembly will continue to reflect the general will of the international community to maintain peace and security for all nations  as well as its resolve to improve the welfare of all mankind. While expressing these expectations  we call upon those who are directly entrusted by the Charter with the task of maintaining international peace and security to pay more attention to the resolutions adopted year after year by the Assembly.112.	Let me make a brief survey of the African scene in the context of the aims and objectives of the United Nations. The OAU went through a turbulent phase last year. Touchy and acute issues faced us in our continent. Under the chairmanship of the President of Kenya  Daniel Arap Moi  and with other heads of State and Government who attended the OAU Assembly  the organization was able to solve some of these thorny problems  and our organization was able to function in the interests of Africa and the world in general.113.	The problem of Chad remains unresolved. At the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa in June 1983  the President of Kenya  who was then Chairman of the Assembly  observed: Subsequent to the withdrawal of the peace-keeping force from Chad  there were indications that internal peace  reconciliation and national reconstruction were possible within the newly created political environment. This optimism has not fully materialized. Chad continues to experience internal conflicts with active support from external sources. As we have stated on many occasions regarding internal conflicts elsewhere in the world  we repeat the same by totally objecting to foreign interference in the internal affairs of States. In this particular case we reject and condemn interference in the internal affairs of Chad. We express the sincere hope that the people of Chad  left alone  will certainly sort out their problems in a more amicable and lasting way. 114.	In the case of Western Sahara  at the same session my President reminded the African heads of State and Government that a referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people of the Territory would pave the way for a more amicable settlement of the problem of the Territory. In this  Kenya supports the efforts of the OAU Implementation Committee on Western Sahara.115.	The Horn of Africa continues to be a region of tension and conflict. The existence of hostility in this area has adversely affected peaceful relations and the application of meaningful economic co-operation in the region. We are convinced that this conflict could easily be removed if all States in the area recognized and applied the fundamental OAU principle in regard to the sovereignty of independent States  respect for boundaries existing at the time of independence and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.116.	In South Africa  the tragedy of apartheid continues. The racist South African regime seeks to perpetuate its illegal rule  in defiance of decisions of this body. After decades of condemnation and protests by all peace- loving people the world over  including some whites in South Africa itself  the evil and inhuman system of apartheid continues to flourish  embracing as it does the total denial of political rights to the majority. Opposition to apartheid is met with brutal force against defenseless people  including children. It is a system which violates all the universal principles of human dignity on which the United Nations itself is based  yet all our efforts to have stronger action taken against South Africa continue to meet crippling resistance. We have adopted countless resolutions in the Assembly condemning the system. We have held many international gatherings which have exposed and equally condemned the evil system practiced by a racist minority bent on destroying the very tenets of civilized conduct  the most recent gathering being the Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  held at Geneva in August 1983. We must bring this inhuman system to an end.117.	The racist regime has stubbornly stepped up its policy of destabilization of the neighbouring States. Mozambique  Angola and the landlocked Kingdom of Lesotho have been victims of South African military aggression. We have castigated and deplored this aggression  and we appeal to the Western countries  friends of South Africa  to use their influence to stop South Africa committing further military aggression against these countries and the other front-line States.118.	In 1977 the Security Council  in a modest step forward  imposed an arms embargo against South Africa and decided that the sale of arms to South Africa represented a threat to international peace and security. We know  however  that this resolution  418 (1977)  has been violated by certain States. The time has come when the international community must face up to the gravity of the situation in South Africa. There is no longer any time left for ambiguity and prevarication over	We must urge the friends of South Africa to declare without any qualification that the sale of arms and related materials to South Africa poses a threat to international peace and security under the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.119.	Information has come to us through the public media and from various sources to the effect that the racist regime is making moves to remove petty apartheid in public places  extend limited suffrage to coloured people and Indians in South Africa and create Bantustans. Let us not be confused by such information  whether or not it is true. We should not be deceived by such designs. Kenya has all along been calling for the total eradication of apartheid. We remain confident that the struggle to put an end to the	system will succeed. We must continue to give every assistance possible to the freedom fighters in South Africa and Namibia in their legitimate struggle under the leadership of their liberation movements until final victory is won and apartheid vanishes forever.120.	In the 38 years of United Nations history  there are voluminous records of the illegal and brutal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. Not content with the illegal occupation  South Africa has converted Namibia into a military base  a spring-board from which it has carried out frequent unprovoked attacks against neighbouring States.121.	Since 1966  South Africa has defiantly resisted every move aimed at a peaceful termination of its illegal occupation of Namibia. Indeed  Africa and the entire world community are bound to ask what it is that South Africa wants. It is now more than five years since the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia was endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978). At the time that resolution was adopted  we hoped that South Africa had regained its senses and was ready to co-operate in implementing a peaceful transition to independence for Namibia. Our hopes have been rudely frustrated by South Africa's intransigence. Instead of moving towards the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  the regime has now resorted to an intensified war against neighbouring States  particularly Angola  Mozambique and Lesotho.122.	A State or group of States has brought up an issue simply to complicate negotiations for the independence of Namibia. We must not confuse the issue of Namibia's independence with the territorial integrity of Angola. We state here once more that we strongly reject the linking of the independence of Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. We know that such linkage was first suggested and has been encouraged by one permanent member of the Security Council. Given this encouragement  South Africa has remained not only stubborn but more aggressive towards Angola. Angola is an independent State and must be accorded the right to look for help  given the aggression coming from South Africa. We will not accept any propaganda conceived in a superpower context to justify South Africa's presence in Namibia.123.	The Security Council met in May this year and  in resolution 532 (1983)  mandated the secretary-General to carry out consultations with the parties concerned. The results of those consultations reveal that South Africa is still adamantly demanding the removal of Cuban troops from Angola  as though a connection between the two issues ever existed. The international community still demands that South Africa change its stand in this issue. Furthermore  we learn that South Africa has announced its intention to establish a state council in Namibia to draw up a constitution for Namibia. The move is an attempt to impose a settlement on Namibia that is favourable to South Africa. It was condemned by the Non- Aligned Movement in March this year and deserves further condemnation by this body. The action by South Africa is not only inconsistent with Security Council resolution 439 (1978) but also represents an attempt by the Pretoria regime to obstruct the implementation of the internationally recognized United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia.124.	The international community must face squarely its responsibility for Namibia. We remain extremely concerned that the United Nations efforts have been frustrated by the use of the veto in the Security Council. We have the rather anomalous situation where those whose efforts for the independence of Namibia are spurned by South Africa are  at the same time  the ones who protect South Africa with vetoes against the stronger action demanded by South Africa's intransigence. Something must be done to remove that anomaly. We from Africa have come a long way in our struggle to liberate our continent from regimes based on racial discrimination and colonialism. At the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983  the President of my country  Daniel Arap Moi  who was then still Chairman of the OAU Assembly  stated: All of us in Africa wish for nothing less on behalf of Namibia than total and unobstructed independence  so that the people of that country can work out their own political system and development strategies. We will not stop in our drive at the border of Namibia. This should serve as a clear message to South Africa and its friends. 125.	I shall now draw the Assembly's attention to one of the most dangerous areas on the international scene. I refer to the problem of the Middle East and to recent events in that area. The situation has remained tense  with violent conflicts  over the last three decades. During that time the international community has witnessed the miserable plight of the Palestinian people  dispossessed  uprooted from their land and dispersed. The threat to international peace and security coming from that area is perpetrated by Israeli policies of expansionism and aggrandizement.126.	My delegation has  on many occasions in the deliberations of this Organization  made known its views on the question of the rights of the Palestinian people. We have stated on many occasions that there can be no lasting peace in the area until the legitimate interests of the Palestinians are fully accommodated. We have stated time and again that peace in the region can prevail only if certain conditions are fulfilled.127.	First  Israel must withdraw from all Arab land occupied since 1967. We strongly oppose the acquisition of land through the use of force. It is regrettable that Israel continues to defy the Organization's resolutions with regard to Arab territories it occupies.128.	Secondly  Israel must recognize the rights of the Palestinians as a people  including their rights to self- determination and to an independent State of their own. Israel must be made to understand that it cannot justify its existence by brutally denying the existence of a Palestinian State. When the Organization  back in 1947  partitioned Palestine and created a new State  Israel  it was never the intention of this body to write off the State of Palestine.129.	Thirdly  in all negotiations aimed at solving the problems of the Middle East  the Palestinian people must participate on an equal footing with other parties.130.	Fourthly  we must recognize Israel's right to exist as an independent State within internationally recognized borders.131.	We believe that acceptance of those four conditions would ensure the right atmosphere for establishing peace and security in the region.132.	It is our view that as long as the Palestinians are denied their right to self-determination the problem of the Middle East will remain unsolved. Already Israel has extended this conflict to the independent State of Lebanon  with all the shocking brutalities of last year  which left us immobilized. We call for immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanese territory in the interest of peace and stability in the region.133.	It is regrettable that the war between Iran and Iraq continues  despite the efforts of the non-aligned countries and the international community to bring about a peaceful solution between the two brotherly States. We once again urge both countries to heed the appeals made by the international community to end this costly conflict.134.	I should like to make a short reference to the situation obtaining in both Afghanistan and Kampuchea. Both countries  in the view of my Government  are victims of foreign interference and intervention. My country's position on this question has been voiced in international forums on various occasions  when Kenya has called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea. Kenya deplores any foreign interference and intervention in matters that are exclusively internal to any given State. We call for full respect for the principles of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of all States. A violation of these principles on any pretext is contrary to the aims and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. In this respect  therefore  we call for the total withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea without further delay.135.	The issue of Cyprus continues to feature prominently in the Organization's debates. Kenya has called and will always continue to call for respect for and recognition of the territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty of Cyprus. We call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cyprus. We urge the people of Cyprus themselves to revive the inter-communal talks in order to solve their problems without external obstacles.136.	We are also extremely concerned about the continuing tensions in Central America and the Caribbean. This region is faced with serious political  social and economic crises  greatly aggravated by external intervention. It is our view that the increasing threats and acts of aggression from outside forces have worsened the situation. My Government would like to commend the peace initiatives presented by the Governments of Mexico  Colombia  Panama  Venezuela and France and the positive responses which have come from some of the States in the region.137.	I wish to make some observations on another matter that continues to be of concern to the Organization as well as to my country. Kenya has supported and will continue to support the proposal that the Indian Ocean be designated a zone of peace. To us in Kenya  the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  is not a political slogan but is essential for safeguarding our own territorial integrity. We support the call for an international conference on the Indian Ocean to consider all the aspects of this problem. We urge all the maritime States to co-operate fully with the littoral and hinterland States of the Ocean in the preparations for such a conference.138.	It is with absurd cynicism that human beings seem to have opted for total annihilation as their imperative mission and ultimate destiny. We have been witnessing mounting tension and distrust all over the world. Endless negotiations have failed to promote real progress in halting the arms race or lowering the tensions among nations. The goal of general and complete disarmament continues to dude mankind  and inevitably this leaves the States living in the lengthening shadow of burgeoning nuclear stockpiles.139.	The socio-economic problems currently contaminating the world cannot be viewed in isolation from the arms build-ups and the ever-increasing military budgets. It does not make sense or logic to be spending over $650 billion annually on the manufacture of armaments when no adequate resources are being made available for the economic development and social welfare of the majority of the world's people. It is a sad paradox of the twentieth century that the third world economies  buffeted by recession and faced with all sorts of setbacks to their economic development  are spending an average of over 12 per cent of their gross national product on the procurement of weapons of war. The accumulated experience of human history shows quite clearly that if we do not end this mad rush to manufacture more and more terrible weapons of destruction  we shall be heading for self-destruction and the annihilation of human civilization.140.	The need to build and strengthen trust and confidence among nations is urgent and imperative  and Kenya stands ready and willing to play its part as a first step on the road to strengthening international understanding. The time has come for the adoption by the Assembly of a convention that will guarantee the security of non- nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.141.	The continuing deterioration of the international situation and the intensification of the arms race have brought the world to the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. In such a political climate no progress can be made in disarmament negotiations. We therefore call on all States  in particular the nuclear-weapon States and other militarily significant States  to demonstrate the political will and firm commitment necessary for the implementation of the recommendations made and decisions taken in the field of disarmament.142.	One of the historic events of this decade is the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea/ The occasion not only marked the emergence of a new legal regime governing the exploitation of the sea  the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof  but also demonstrated clearly the importance of equitable compromise in the interest of all mankind. TheConvention was the result of hard negotiations over a period of many years  and it is Kenya's hope that even those countries which were not able to support the Convention at the time of its adoption will find it both useful and necessary to do so in the future  to ensure uniformity in its implementation and use.143.	As a result of the adoption of the Convention  the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has commenced its work. It is expected that it will bring about a smooth transition for the coming into force of the Convention. We are encouraged by this trend.144.	The Preparatory Commission has been considering various matters relating to sea-bed mining and the question of bringing into operation the International Sea-Bed Authority  the Enterprise and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. This is a difficult task  but we are encouraged by the manner in which the Commission is tackling its work. We therefore appeal to the whole of the United Nations membership to support the Commission  for only thus can the international community be assured of a smooth  effective and uniform implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.145.	For the last nine years we have been working on ways and means of strengthening the Organization's effectiveness. In fulfilling this task under the Charter  the United Nations has faced the very basic problem of the use of the power of veto. At times this power has been abused by those to whom it has been entrusted  for selfish national interests rather than for the maintenance of international peace and security. We are disappointed with the lack of concrete progress in the work of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on Strengthening the Role of the Organization. It is important for all of us to realize that unless we make the United Nations a viable organization  to enable it to maintain international peace and security as envisaged in the Charter  there will be no peace for anyone. I therefore wish to make a special appeal to the permanent members of the Security Council to allow progress to be made in the work of this Special Committee.146.	Another area of great interest and concern to the Government and people of Kenya is the current international economic situation. We are gravely concerned at the critical situation in which the international economy finds itself today. The world economy as a whole is engulfed in a prolonged and deepening crisis which threatens the economic future of all countries  but it is the developing countries which have been hit the hardest by its effects  resulting in the severe curtailment of their economic growth and seriously impairing their prospects for years to come.147.	The economic situation in the developing countries is pathetic. It is in those countries that we find acute balance-of-payments problems  foreign exchange shortages  falling per capita incomes  rapidly rising unemployment  high rates of inflation and other economic problems. In Africa particularly  the Governments continue to battle with economic problems of such magnitude that they are unable to meet targets contained in their own development plans. As a result  the African peoples continue to be plagued by hunger  disease and ignorance many years after achieving independence.148.	One wonders whether there is sufficient concern among the developed countries of the North over the declining per capita incomes of the developing countries which are already over-burdened by extreme poverty  malnutrition and massive underemployment. One wonders also whether there is sufficient understanding of the implications of investment cutbacks and disrupted development programmes in the developing countries. The intense problems that the people in the developing countries face every day of their lives in a situation with no hope for the future should not be tolerated. We cannot expect international peace and security to prevail if the present world economic disorder persists. We should not underestimate the dangers that could arise from the majority of the people in the developing countries of the South who continue to be victims of the present international economic arrangement and whose hopes for a better tomorrow are dwindling at an alarming rate.149.	The outlook for international economic relations is grim. While the attempt to launch global negotiations in the United Nations continues to face an impasse  many developed countries are not honouring their past commitments. In some cases  some developed countries have shown signs of disowning commitments contained in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and other resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and in other bodies of the United Nations. In view of all this  the developing countries  including my own  feel disillusioned  as they continue to face stagnating or falling export earnings  high debt-service burdens  investment cutbacks  rising unemployment and continuous decline in per capita incomes.150.	This session is being held at a time when the economic problems confronting the developing countries are more acute than ever. In the view of my delegation  trade is a very important component of international economic co-operation. Its decline has deprived developing countries of the badly needed foreign exchange without which they are unable to import capital goods and other things required for economic development. The terms of trade of the developing countries have been declining for years  but they have deteriorated sharply since 1980  when the prices of primary commodities collapsed. Since 1980 the tide of protectionism in the developed market-economy countries has been more evident than ever before because of inward-looking policies of these countries. It was painfully apparent last November that the ministerial- level meeting of the Contracting Parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade lacked the liberal consensus which characterized previous trade rounds.151.	As the Assembly is aware  developing countries members of the Group of 77 met at Buenos Aires to prepare the Buenos Aires Platform/ in preparation for the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which was held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983. The Group of 77 had undertaken intensive work to arrive at its positions  which include specific proposals for action by the international community to improve international trading relations. Needless to say  the developing countries were disappointed at Belgrade because  whereas they went there with open minds for negotiations  they were treated to negative attitudes of the States in Group 3. The theme of recovery and development which was the central theme of the sixth session was therefore diluted by developed countries  which refused to co-operate in the vital areas of trade  money and finance. My delegation joins those delegations which feel that the session failed just at a time when immediate measures were needed to improve the terms of trade of the developing countries.152.	The developing countries are in great need of financial resources  without which they cannot continue their development efforts. For my own country  the year 1982/83 was particularly difficult because the Government had to curtail expenditures. Yet  this was happening only two years after the adoption by the international community in 1980 of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade  in which it was recognized that external financial resources  particularly official development assistance  constitute an indispensable element of support for the developing countries' own efforts. I will be speaking for the developing countries if I say that none of the major developed countries will have reached the target of the 0.7 per cent of their gross national product required by the Strategy by 1985. We have only 14 months to go before January 1985.153.	Let me take this opportunity to repeat that the present international monetary and financial arrangements are not adequate for the equitable development of the world economy and accelerated development of developing countries as anticipated in the International Development Strategy. Although the Bretton Woods institutions were created for that purpose  they seem to act more in the interest of the developed countries than the developing countries. These views were expressed in the statement recently made by my President at  one of the international meetings where he stated: We should also recall that rules governing the major international lending institutionsâthe IMF and the World Bankâwere designed in the absence of developing countries  and we still have very little say in the respective decision-making processes. This is a frustration to the whole situation  since there is much hard-won experience  embodying opinions and ideas  which the developing States could now contribute. My own view is that there is now an abundant case for restructuring of the international monetary system  and there is most certainly a need for resuming allocations of special drawing rights as a feature of some expanded and liberalized measures of balance of payments support for developing countries. 154.	As an immediate measure in this regard  the seventh summit meeting of the non-aligned countries  meeting at New Delhi last March  proposed an international conference on money and finance for development at which some of the most pressing monetary and financial issues in the developing countries would be tackled. These proposals  which have now been widely accepted  should be endorsed at this session.155.	My Government attaches the greatest importance to the industrialization of developing countries  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It will be recalled that last year the Assembly adopted resolution 37/212  which  infer requested the Secretary-General to allocate adequate staff and financial resources so as to ensure the effective co-ordination and implementation of the activities of UNIDO and ECA related to the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. Since this session of the Assembly will be considering the report of the Industrial Development Board   it is my sincere hope that there have been responses in order to implement the programme of the Decade. In this connection  also  I urge the Fourth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization to give significance to the Decade by including it in its agenda.156.	Turning now to the question of science and technology  I would like to stress that my Government attaches great significance to development of science and technology developing countries. We believe that science and technology are crucial vehicles for the implementation of the International Development Strategy and for the early attainment of the new international economic order. It is regrettable  therefore  that four years after the conclusion of the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development   no substantial agreement has been reached to implement the Programme  especially as it relates to financial resources. My Government urgently calls for an early resolution of the unresolved issues in the Vienna Programme of Action through intensified negotiations within the appropriate United Nations bodies  including the Intergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Development.157.	Energy is an essential element of the development process and it continues to cause very serious problems  particularly to developing nations like my own which are adversely affected by the energy crisis. The need to shift nations from dependence on petroleum to greater reliance on alternative sources of energy led to the adoption in 1981 of the Nairobi Programme of Action for the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy.? My delegation at this juncture is concerned at the slow pace in the implementation of the Nairobi Programme  particularly on the question of mobilization of financial resources for harnessing new and renewable sources of energy. During this session of the Assembly  the Kenya delegation stands ready to participate actively in the discussions of this item in order to find ways and means of implementing the Programme without further delay.158.	We are aware of the reports submitted to the Assembly on the eleventh session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme and the sixth session of the Commission on Human Settlements. The important recommendations of those two organs need implementation and  for that to be done  adequate financial resources are indeed necessary. My delegation therefore calls on the developed donor countries and others in a position to do so to make substantial contributions towards the implementation of the planned programmes in the fields of environment and human settlements.159.	Turning now to the question of economic and technical co-operation among developing countries  Kenya has repeatedly called on developing countries to intensify their co-operation at subregional  regional and interregional levels in all fields. As for the developed countries  my delegation urges them to view activities in connection with economic and technical co-operation among developing countries not as being discriminatory against them  but as complementing North-South co-operation. The developed countries should therefore accord all necessary support to those activities.160.	It was in the spirit of South-South co-operation that developing countries adopted the Caracas Programme of Action in 1981  the implementation of which has been enhanced by the many intergovernmental economic and technical meetings in the last two years. Also  in certain regions new initiatives of South-South co-operation have emerged. For instance  in December 1981 some 18 countries of eastern and southern Africa concluded a treaty establishing a preferential trade area which is already operational  the treaty having been signed and ratified by the majority of the member States. The technical services utilized during the negotiations of that treaty were rendered by ECA. My Government and other Governments of the subregion would appreciate any assistance to the young preferential trade area in order to make it a reality.161.	The critical economic problems facing Africa require concerted international attention. Africa is the least developed of all the continents and suffers from underdevelopment  food shortages  balance-of-payments problems  foreign exchange shortages and acute lack of external financial resources for development. In addition to these problems  Africa has a majority of the least developed countries. Out of all the problems facing Africa  my delegation would like to single out the acute food shortages that recent reports have shown. Food and agricultural production have declined drastically in Africa in the recent years owing  inter alia to adverse climatic conditions  rising population  inadequate investment in the agricultural sector  lack of storage facilities and shortage of foreign exchange to import agricultural items such as fertilizers. Yet food and agriculture are the most important elements in human life because they involve the very survival of mankind in that food is a basic need. It is necessary  therefore  for the international community to take urgent collective measures to assist African countries in the implementation of the Lagos Plan of Action for the economic development of Africa in order to alleviate critical food shortages and to attain self-sufficiency in food in Africa. It is particularly important for the international community to assist African Governments to adopt and implement food policies at the national level. We therefore look forward to increased assistance from both bilateral donors and multilateral sources.162.	We end by appealing to all gathered here during the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly to make concrete  practical and action-oriented recommendations and decisions which are geared towards making this world a better place for mankind as a whole today and in the days to come.  "
"76",3755,"KHM",38,1983,"ï»¿2.	 Mr. President  on behalf of Democratic Kampuchea  I have the honour to extend to you my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly and the conduct of the business of this important session.3.	Your brilliant election is a well-deserved tribute by the international community to you personally  to your country  the Republic of Panama  and its valiant people  and to the whole of Latin America  whose historic contribution to the elaboration and formulation of the noble principles of the Charter and to their defence has constantly had a positive effect on the destiny of the Organization.4.	Allow me to greet the Secretary-General and to convey to him  on behalf of my country and its national coalition Government  our sincere admiration and profound gratitude for his courageous  resolute and clear sighted action in the service of justice and peace in an uneasy world.5.	Finally  I warmly welcome  on behalf of Democratic Kampuchea  the entry of the sovereign State of Saint Christopher and Nevis into the Organization  and pay a tribute to the States Members of the United Nations which  faithful to the noble ideals of the Charter of the United Nations  and going against the wind and the tide  support an independent  neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea and maintain the rights and legitimacy of our Government within this Assembly. I feel it my duty to state here that the United Nations is the last hope of attacked  oppressed and colonized peoples such as mine  who are the victims of hegemonistic and expansionist Powers.6.	It is to the credit of the United Nations that the General Assembly  by an overwhelming majority  continues to see that Democratic Kampuchea receives justice. Some Governments friendly to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam now wish to oust Democratic Kampuchea and replace it by a regime which  as everybody well knows  has been installed in our capital by the Vietnamese army. As all people of good faith have noted  this regime represents only its foreign masters. It consists of mere puppets whose strings are pulled by Hanoi. Is it conceivable that these puppets could become Members of the United Nations?7.	By contrast  the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  its Administration and its armed forces have gathered around them  in resistance to the occupiers  all Khmer patriots  men and women  from all sectors and of all ideological or political tendencies.8.	Our Government is not in exile. Its Ministers are working and carrying on the struggle on the national soil of Kampuchea  which at the present time comprises several liberated zones  not only near Thailand's border  but also in the south-west  the north-east and other parts of the country. Our liberated zones are controlled by the armed forces of our tripartite Coalition  whose fighters increase in number year by year. At present they consist of about 60 000 armed men capable of operating far from their bases. Hundreds of thousands of men  women  old people and children live in these zones. At least 300 000 people live near the Thai-Kampuchean border.9.	Those in foreign circles hostile to my Government have asserted that it ""controls no territory"". I would point out to them that in April and May 1983  at the height of the Vietnamese offensive against our main bases  I received on the national territory of Kampuchea six ambassadors from friendly countries  who presented their credentials to me in the presence of radio and television teams and correspondents from the international press.10.	Foreign personalities who doubt the vitality of our national resistance may  if they wish  accompany me in January 1984 to free Kampuchea to meet our people  our soldiers  our Buddhist monks and our Muslim and Christian compatriots. They will also have the opportunity to witness the arrival in the liberated area of Kampuchea of at least four ambassadors coming from friendly countries to present their credentials to the President of Democratic Kampuchea.11.	It is therefore obvious that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  an important military Power  has not succeeded in taking control of the whole of Kampuchea  despite massive aid from the Soviet Union.12.	I would add that during the last dry season the massive  murderous offensives launched by the Vietnamese army against our bases and our liberated zones met with a military setback. To take revenge for that setback  the enemy attacked our civilian population and massacred a large number of elderly people  womenâincluding pregnant womenâand children who could not be evacuated in time from the villages close to the front.13.	The Vietnamese armed forces are  and will remain  incapable of wiping out Kampuchean patriots on Kampuchean soil. If the United Nations were to expel from its midst the Government of a country which is the victim of aggression and which defends with courage its inalienable right to freedom and self-determination that would be tantamount to repudiating its Charter and everything that justifies its existence.14.	I well understand that the United Nations attaches the greatest importance to the problems of underdevelopment  to the painful plight of refugees throughout the world  to North-South co-operation and to other similar vital problems.15.	In my humble opinion  however  we must not permit a situation in which we cannot see the wood for the trees. The problem of refugees  for instance  cannot be resolved while its root causes  which are primarily political  remain.16.	The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization said: ""The problem of refugees can be resolved only with a settlement of the root political causes"". The question of the Kampuchean refugees cannot be resolved without the settlement of its root problemâthe political problem of Kampuchea. If hundreds of thousands of Khmers have sought refuge outside their country  it is clearly because they did not  and do not  support domination by the Vietnamese.17.	Since 1979 the General Assembly has adopted each year  at each of its sessions  just resolutions on Kampuchea. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and its allies have rejected those resolutions  despite the fact that they are Members of the Organization and should be the first to respect them conscientiously.18.	At present  the Kingdom of Thailand has to bear the heavy burden of sheltering hundreds of thousands of Kampuchean refugees who obstinately refuse to return to their villages where they would live under Vietnamese domination.19.	Even now  every day dozens of my compatriots fleeing from the Vietnamese occupiers come at great risk to take refuge in the Thai-Kampuchean border areas  thus creating increasingly serious social and economic problems. Those problems are tackled  with boundless devotion and great difficulty  by a number of compassionate countries  in particular Thailand  and various international organizations such as UNHCR  the International Committee of the Red Cross  UNICEF  UNDRO  and other humanitarian organizations.20.	The countries which have taken in the Kampuchean refugees have done their duty nobly  but most of them have let us know that from now on it will be difficult for them to accept any more refugees.21.	The United States of America and France alone have already given shelter to more than 100 000 of our compatriots. Tens of thousands of others have taken refuge in Canada  the Federal Republic of Germany  the United Kingdom  Switzerland  Austria  Belgium  the Netherlands  Australia  New Zealand  the Philippines  Malaysia  Singapore  China  Hong Kong  Macao  Japan and Senegal and other countries of Africa. Overall  about one million Kampuchean refugees have been scattered to the four comers of the world or live in the liberated zones of Kampuchea among the local population  which shows that my compatriots absolutely refuse to live under the yoke of Vietnamese colonialism.22.	The propaganda of Hanoi claims that my people reject Sihanouk and his Coalition Government. If that is so  why do Viet Nam  its allies and its friends persist so steadfastly and vehemently in refusing to allow the Kampuchean people to choose freely its own form of government through general elections held under international supervision as advocated by the United Nations? That categorical refusal is irrefutable evidence of the fact that the people and the nation of Kampuchea demand the departure of the Vietnamese and the removal of their puppets and lackeys in Phnom Penh.23.	It is my hope and that of all Kampuchean patriots that at the present session of the General Assembly thedelegations of all countries committed to justice  independence and peace will support my country by voting overwhelmingly in favour of its rebirth as a sovereign  neutral and independent State  free from all foreign occupation.24.	The present situation in Kampuchea is worsening as a result of the fact that in addition to the 200 000 Vietnamese soldiers and the thousands of ""technicians"" and ""advisers"" from Hanoi who control a part of our country  there are about 600 000 Vietnamese settlers who have been sent to our country to exploit our lands and rice fields  our villages  forests  lakes  rivers  coasts and other natural resources.25.	That figure of 600 000 Vietnamese settlers dispatched to Kampuchea has been confirmed by our Thai neighbour. At a meeting with the international press at Bangkok  on i6 September 1983  Mr. Jetn Sucharitkul  a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand  said that Viet Nam ""has sent nearly 600 000 Vietnamese immigrants to settle in Kampuchea.""26.	The sending of Vietnamese settlers by the Hanoi Government physically to vietnamize my country has been carried out at a dramatically accelerated rate.27.	The nation review of Bangkok  on Friday  11 March 1983  wrote the following:""According to intelligence reports  the migration rate was on the rise last year without any sign that the massive flow would slow down in the near future. With the resettlement of the Vietnamese immigrants in re-  source-rich areasâsome of which  if not all  are their exclusive zoneâalong the Viet Nam-Kampuchea border  around Tonle Sap and in the capital of Phnom Penh  growing conflicts between them and the local people have been reported  prompting the Heng Samrin regime to issue at least two sets of directives late last year to minimize the conflicts. Still  the announcements  particularly the one released on 10 October  made it clear that the regime would continue to be committed to the policy on the Vietnamese immigrants and 'widening the scope of exchange of views between the two peoples and promoting their connections  which will lead to co-operation and unity of the two countries'.""Vietnamese troops who defected to the Moulinaka resistance movement on 1 April last year were also quoted as saying that Hanoi was pursuing every available means to get the Vietnamese people resettled in Kampucheaâas many of them as possible.""28.	In addition to that physical vietnamization of Kampuchea  there is an odious cultural vietnamization of the life of our colonized people.29.	Mr. Colin Campbell  who was in Phnom Penh seven months ago  wrote an article on that subject that was published in New York Times on 3 April 1983. He said  among other things  the following:""More than four years after its invasion of Cambodia  Viet Nam has extended its influence deep into the daily lives of the Cambodian people.""In the marketplace and the rice field  on the stage  in the classroom  in Government offices and elsewhere  Viet Nam's influence over the Cambodians is far- reaching . . .""Politically  the Vietnamese-installed Government of President Heng Samrin ... is still deeply dependentfor its basic policies and ideology on Vietnamese advisers and Vietnamese patterns.""[Cambodian] students  when greeted in French by the reporters  appeared not to know the language.""And since the new Cambodian school system does not offer French  the country's acquaintance with medical and other technical world literatures would seem to be at an awkward stage.""The Minister of Education  Pen Navuth  said later in an interview that learning Vietnamese was part of the 'mutual co-operation' between the two nations."" The study of Vietnamese takes place not only in the medical faculty but in all ministries'  he said.""To date  the books have all been printed in Ho Chi Minh City  formerly Saigon.""They teach literature and history by . . . praising the long ties between the 'progressive forces' of Viet Nam and Cambodia  the unity of lndo-China and its deep friendship with the Soviet Union  and by explaining the 'two revolutionary tasks' of Viet Nam and now of Cambodia: the defence and construction of communism.""The portraits on the library wall are of Marx  Lenin  Heng Samrin and Ho Chi Minh.""Gratitude towards Viet Nam [is] repeated on the Government radio and amplified morning and night  wherever there are loudspeakers across Cambodia.""At the Royal Palace . . . young dancers in Cambodia's national ballet can be seen varying traditional sequences with new ones of a political sort. Three young women flow onto the stage in the traditional clothes of Viet Nam  Laos and Cambodia.""The flag of international communism serves as the unifying symbol in a performance at the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh. At a park  a plane in a children's ride bears the Vietnamese flag and the date of the friendship pact between Cambodia and Viet Nam. In the capital  a sober educated Cambodian pulled a Western reporter aside and told him  simply and desperately  that the Vietnamese were 'very bad'.""Derogatory Khmer terms for the Vietnamese are heard regularly in private conversations. And a few Cambodian officials are said not to have enjoyed the company of their Vietnamese advisers. The Chief of Staff in 1979 of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Chea Tra  was said by two defectors to have grown so angry at his Vietnamese adviser that he shot him dead.""30. Among the prominent foreign personalities who particularly sympathize with the unspeakable sufferings of the Kampuchean people  I should like to quote Mr. Anerood Jugnauth  Prime Minister of Mauritius  who said the following from this rostrum last week:""In South-East Asia we are witnesses to ruthless cultural destruction in which the proud Khmers continue to suffer the occupation of their country. A rich and ancient civilization  nurtured patiently over several centuries  is being mercilessly destroyed and the genius of the Khmer people is being regimented out of existence. We are appalled by the lack of concern shown by the world for what has become an endangered people and a civilization facing extinction. The fact that this sore has festered for eight years does not in any way attenuate the urgency of finding a solution to it. We call for the immediate termination of the foreign occupation of Cambodia  the restoration of its non- aligned status and the re-establishment of the Cambodian people's right to self-determination in a truly independent country."" Before touching the last part of my statement  which will be devoted to our foreign policy  I shall quote to you from one of the numerous foreign reports on the vitality and development of our national resistance to the Vietnamese occupation.31.	The following are excerpts from the article entitled ""The New Indochina War"" by Mr. Al Santoli  published by Random House in 1983:""In the four and a half years since the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in December 1978   . . they and the puppet government they installed have not won what the Americans used to call the hearts and the minds of the people. Resistance throughout the countryside has been growing considerably . . .""Despite the presence of 200 000 Soviet-armed and Soviet-advised Vietnamese troops and with little aid from the outside world  each year resistance activities increase  even near the capital and the Vietnamese border. In an eerie echo of earlier wars  the Vietnamese control the day but fear the night. In Phnom Penh and in provincial capitals  early evening curfews are enforced. The current Phnom Penh Government  which call itself the People's Republic of Kampuchea . . . depends almost entirely on Vietnamese troops for its survival.""Except for the terror attacks on civilian camps  this war has not gone well for the Vietnamese. They have suffered tens of thousands of casualties  and officials in Hanoi admit that troop morale has faded. Phanat Nikhom camp in Thailand holds hundreds of Vietnamese military deserters. Nguyen Xuan Han  a defector who fought against the Americans in Viet Nam and marched victoriously into Saigon in 1975  told Ronald Yates of the Chicago Tribune last May: 'The war will never end in Cambodia. Instead  the blood of Viet Nam turns the rice paddies red and Cambodia has become Viet Nam's grave.' Another Vietnamese  Mr. Pham  said: 'The Cambodian nationalist soldiers are tough. They believe they are fighting to keep their culture from ending. And they are right. What Hanoi is doing is not according to the socialism I was taught. Instead  it is just killing off our young people.'""The army of Heng Samrin's puppet government has tried conscripting men from 14 to 45 years of age and women from 18 to 45. But many defect because they do not want to fight their own people. Those caught trying to flee to resistance-controlled areas have been severely punished by the Vietnamese. Some have been executed . . .""32.	We sincerely hope that a political solution can be found for the problem of Kampuchea  one in keeping with the just resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on Kampuchea.33.	We call upon the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Soviet U in to respect those resolutions and to participate in the International Conference on Kampuchea in order to solve this problem for which those two Powers bear the major part of the responsibility in Kampuchea.34.	Viet Nam has never stopped saying that it will withdraw all its troops from Kampuchea when the so- called Chinese threat has disappeared. All honest observers can testify that there is no ""Chinese threat"" either in my country or near it. The only threat in our region  South-East Asia  comes from the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Soviet Union.35.	The best guarantee that the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea can give to those two Powers is the following. First  our Kampuchea  once completely liberated  will be strictly neutral and non-aligned. Our country will be as neutral in Asia as Switzerland and Austria are in Europe. Secondly  the general elections in Kampuchea will be held under United Nations supervision.36.	In this respect  we approve and will implement point 4 of the Joint Statement by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  circulated recently as a United Nations document	which reads as follows:"" . following the total withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea  the Kampuchean people must be able to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination through internationally-supervised elections in which all Kampucheans shall participate and all political groups in Kampuchea should be encouraged to work towards the goal of national reconciliation.""37.	Thirdly  there will also be reconciliation and friendship with Viet Nam and its allies if they once and for all stop interfering in Kampuchea's internal affairs and respect the independence  sovereignty  neutrality and territorial integrity of our country.38.	The struggle for national liberation that is being carried on by those people is inseparable from the struggle of other people that are the victims of injustice.39.	However difficult our own situation may be  it is our duty to show our complete solidarity with our valiant brothers.40.	Our most sincere good wishes go to our brothers and sisters of Laos  whose legitimate aspiration is to recover their national independence and freedom.41.	We reiterate our firm support for the Afghan people who have been struggling heroically against Soviet invasion and occupation for at out four years. We call for the total withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan  to enable the Afghan people to exercise freely their right to self-determination  and the Afghan people to regain its sovereignty and status as a genuinely non-aligned country.42.	We express once again our unwavering support for the Korean people who  with confidence  courage and tenacity  have been striving for years to establish the conditions necessary for the reunification of their homeland. We reaffirm our strong support for the just  realistic and wise proposals put forward by Marshal Kim 11 Sung  President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.43.	Our solidarity with the Palestinian people and the other Arab peoples struggling to recover all their territories occupied since 1967 has never wavered.44.	We remain convinced that peace and security in the Middle East cannot be re-established without a comprehensive  just and lasting solution of the Palestinian problem  worked out with the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLC]  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and nation. Such a solution can be found only by implementing the relevant United Nations resolutions and the Declaration of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine held recently at Geneva.'45.	Further delay in solving the Palestinian problem can only increase tension in the region. This has been proved by the worsening of the situation in Lebanon. It is urgently necessary that all foreign forces whose deployment in the country is not authorized by the Government of Lebanon withdraw and that the independence  sovereignty  national unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon be respected by all States.46.	We earnestly hope that the Lebanese people will be able to resolve their problems without foreign interference and in national harmony.47.	We also hope no less earnestly that genuine reconciliation will soon make it possible to put an end to the bloody war between the two neighbouring  brother countries of Iraq and Iran.48.	We reaffirm our strong solidarity with the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization and other African peoples in their just struggle against the racist regime of Pretoria  and we hope that Namibia will soon achieve independence  with territorial integrity.49.	In this respect  allow me to congratulate the Secretary-General on his commendable efforts and initiatives aimed at ensuring the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions on Namibia.50.	The international community is also worried about the situation in the Horn of Africa. In this regard  we support the just stand adopted by the Organization of African Unity and the States concerned  aimed at the restoration of peace in that region. We reaffirm our strong solidarity with the people of Somalia  who are waging a valiant and legitimate struggle to safeguard the independence and ensure the territorial integrity of their country.51.	We reaffirm our fraternal support for the people and Government of Chad in the just struggle they are waging to safeguard the territorial integrity and defend the independence  sovereignty and national unity of their land. We hope that the people of Chad soon gain peace by means of national reconciliation  and live in security within the frontiers internationally recognized since the decolonization of their country.52.	Finally  the situation in Central America and the Caribbean remains of concern to the international community owing to the increasing tension that prevails there. We support the sincere efforts and initiatives of the Contadora Group aimed at finding a peaceful solution.53.	In conclusion  I wish the delegations participating in the present session of the General Assembly full success in their noble and important tasks. "
"77",3868,"KWT",38,1983,"ï»¿164.	 It is my pleasure at the outset to congratulate the President on his election as President of the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly. I trust that his long experience and high qualifications will be a great help to the session in reaching the results we all seek.165.	At the same time  I should like to thank the President of the preceding session  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the wisdom he displayed while conducting the affairs of that session.166.	I should like also to express our appreciation of the efforts made by the Secretary-General to consolidate the role of the United Nations and increase its efficiency.167.	Kuwait  which believes the world Organization is but a reflection of international society  would like to congratulate the State of Saint Christopher and Nevis on joining the United Nations and takes this opportunity to express its conviction that that new Member will respect its international commitments and fulfil its responsibilities in a capable and competent manner.168.	I should like us all to look back and recall together the gist of the statements made during the general debate at the thirty-seventh session. Those statements concentrated on the spirit of hope and optimism expressed in the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization  which courageously and realistically diagnosed the weaknesses in the international situation that were threatening to lead to the brink of disaster and the effective role that the United Nations should play regarding the world order  and offered valuable suggestions for the course of treatment.169.	Now that a full year has passed since the presentation of that report  on which the Security Council continues its consultations  we must ask ourselves responsibly and honestly what has been done to translate the letter and spirit of the report into reality. What contribution have we made to improve the bleak image of our world today  to eliminate or defuse the hotbeds of international conflict and to enhance the role and effectiveness of the world Organization?170.	Regrettably  the response to all those questions must be negative  for the international situation has not improved  the role of the United Nations has not become more prominent or assertive and the Organization has not become more effective. On the contrary  grave events persist on the international scene  with all their dangerous implications with regard to war and peace  backwardness and development. Last year the world witnessed  as it continues to witness  the occupation of Lebanon  the destruction of Beirut  the refusal of Israel to comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its forces  the escalation of oppressive actions in the occupied Arab lands  the continuance and escalation of the war between Iraq and Iran  the grave tension in Central America with all its dangerous potential  the escalation of racist oppression in southern Africa and the continued deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. But that is not all. There are also problems relating to the economic and social fields as well as human rights.171.	The big Powers bear the primary responsibility for the deterioration of the current world situation. The international community has seen how the narrow special interests of those Powers have been given precedence at the expense in the long term of the common interests of the majority of the nations of the world. It has also seen how they use situations not for the purpose of solving problems  but rather for the purpose of including them in their strategic plans. The inability of the United Nations to solve various problems is  but a reflection of the general international situation. The bigPowers increasingly push the Organization towards the periphery of events instead of using it as the prime mover in the settlement of the serious crisis.172.	Kuwait's responsible attitude is that this situation is not in keeping with the hopes and aspirations of mankind for peace  progress and justice  the very hopes and aspirations which are embodied in the ideals and concepts of the Charter  for whose preservation mankind has carried out a bitter struggle.173.	The question of Palestine has been the focal point of attention since the creation of the United Nations. It has been discussed at all General Assembly sessions. The first international conference sponsored by the United Nations on the question of Palestine was held recently  which in itself is an indication of the importance of this question and its relationship to world peace and security.174.	It is clear to the world that the question of Palestine is the basic problem in the Middle East and the nucleus of the Arab-Israeli conflict  and until the international community imposes a just  permanent and comprehensive solution which is acceptable to the Palestinian people and satisfies its national ambitions  there will be no peace in the region  the state of conflict will persist and world peace and security will remain jeopardized.175.	Through the ages it has been proved by experience  particularly in the Middle East area  that force  no matter how heavy and how varied its methods  will never succeed in uprooting national feelings or forcing rightful owners to relinquish their rights. On the contrary  people cling to their rights and defend their principles. Therefore  we reiterate the principles on which peace in the region must be based and which are accepted by the international community and were asserted recently in the Geneva Declaration on Palestine and the Programme of Action set forth by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine.'"" These are: unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Arab lands occupied since 1967  including the Holy City of Jerusalem; the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including the right of the Palestinians to return to their homeland and recover their properties and their right to self-determination and to establish their own independent State; recognition of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people; and the cessation of the establishment of Israeli settlements and the dismantling of those already established in the occupied Arab lands.176.	The real catastrophe of the Palestinian people regrettably reflects  in one of its aspects  the weakness of the international will and its submission to the logic of force instead of defence of truth and justice. In spite of the international attention to and awareness of the Palestinian question  and in spite of the various conferences and resolutions  this question remains unsolved. In fact it is becoming more and more complicated and tense because of Israel's policy of fait accompli in continuing its aggression to keep the world preoccupied with what is new and co forget what is old. Israel has ignored all the resolutions of the United Nations  in particular those of the Security Council  aided and abetted by the United States  whose unlimited support includes all the financial  military and moral support that Israel needs. This has made Israel an instrument of United States strategy in the region at the expense of the legitimate interests and the historic rights of the rest of the region's nations.177.	It has become quite obvious that as long as the United States is conferring this kind of immunity on Israel and protecting it from the implementation of the international will  the settlement of the Palestinian question will remain unattainable. Therefore Kuwait invites the United States to take a balanced look at that principal question. An unbalanced view could threaten the security and interests of a great number of the nations of the world.178.	Driven by its aggressive tendencies and expansionist and racist philosophies  Israel has committed another crime in Lebanon  one which started a year ago and is still going on  by occupying its land  dispersing its people and perpetrating massacres unprecedented in the history of mankind. Israel  with its military brute force  still refuses to withdraw from Lebanon and makes uncompromising conditions which only reveal its real intention to continue the occupation.179.	The international community  embodied in this Organization  bears a primary responsibility for restoring security and stability to that blighted land. First and foremost is the responsibility to deter the Zionist entity and force it to withdraw from Lebanese territory  instead of supporting it with more supplies of the machines of war and destruction and providing a political cover for its practices  which are contrary to the principles of justice and international law.180.	The Israeli invasion of Lebanese territory has created internal complications which have almost disrupted the Lebanese entity. It has also created devastation and destruction. The brothers and friends of Lebanon were duty-bound to stand by it in its plight. Efforts were made and many initiatives were taken to preserve its people  its sovereignty  its national integrity and even its national cohesion. The world has seen the positive results of the initiatives of the sister Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: its good offices and its extensive efforts to get the parties together and entice them away from the battlefield to the negotiating table. While we pay a tribute to that initiative  we look forward to the support and help of the international community in restoring life  stability and security to our sister Lebanon.181.	Kuwait demands the implementation of the Security Council resolutions which call for the unconditional and immediate withdrawal of Israel from Lebanon and the cessation of all intervention in the internal affairs of that sister country and of all efforts to provoke trouble and feuds among its people. Kuwait has always supported the unity  integrity and independence of Lebanon and the restoration of its stability and prosperity.182.	The other bitter conflict which afflicts our region is the continued Iraq-Iran war  which has now  regrettably  entered its fourth year.183.	The developments in and continuance of that war in that strategically important location of the world threaten not only the two parties to the dispute but all the States of the region.184.	We fully appreciate all the sincere international efforts  both collective and individual  made so far to stop the war  the latest being the initiatives taken by the States of the Gulf Co-operation Council. We regret that none has been successful.185.	While welcoming from this rostrum Iraq's acceptance of and concurrence with all peace initiatives  Kuwait hopes that neighbouring Muslim Iran will follow suit and invoke the letter and spirit of Islam  which call for peace  goodwill  brotherhood  justice and coexistence and reject hostility  hatred and grudges  so that the human and economic capabilities of the peoples of Iraq and Iran may become  springs of goodwill  well-being and peace which will overflow and spread throughout the region and the world.186.	The cause of peace and security in any part of the world is indivisible  and nations cannot allow that danger  which threatens the peace and security of the world  to continue  grow and bear along with it human and economic forces  diverting them from their natural course in the service of man and of peace  without taking common action to stop the war. Kuwait feels that the big Powers and the Security Council have a certain responsibility to take quick and serious action to stop this war.187.	The strategically located Arabian Gulf area has always been a focal point of attention for the big Powers  which were always looking for footholds there  and to such an extent that with their political awareness  the peoples of the region soon realized the far-reaching importance of co-operation among themselves in various spheres as an exemplary deterrent to surrounding dangers. The Gulf Co-operation Council has asserted that it represents the consensus and unity of purpose of the member States. The Council expressed the natural truth that the preservation of the peace  security and stability of the Gulf area is the collective responsibility of its States  without foreign intervention of any kind. The Council has proved in the short period of its existence that it is an important and effective political and economic instrument  and the results of its efforts are beginning to show clearly in the region.188.	Kuwait  which supports all international efforts to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace views that concept from its deep conviction that the whole Asian continent is in need of peace so as to allow its valuable economic resources and natural wealth to be developed under programmes beneficial to its peoples. We hope that the countries participating in the preparatory work of the conference on this subject will display serious political will in order to promote the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.189.	International problems do not persist or escalate unless there are extraneous forces which aggravate them and utilize them for special objectives or purposes. Kuwait therefore would like to see the Muslim people of Afghanistan exercise its right to independence free from foreign intervention. We look forward with hope to the success of the United Nations efforts to restore normal life to Afghanistan and to settle the Kampuchean problem by peaceful means  without resorting to any acts that may justify foreign intervention.190.	The reality which we are experiencing today in the Middle East is similar to another reality in the African continent. In the same way as our region has been affected by a Zionist racist regime and a usurping system  Africa is being assailed by a hateful racist regime which dominates the black majority  by right the lawful owners in South Africa  which continues to occupy the province of Namibia. The racist regime is not even satisfied with this; it also seeks to follow a policy of hegemony and intervention in the affairs of neighbouring African countries.191.	Kuwait considers the situation in southern Africa a fundamental challenge to the international community and to this Organization in particular. The repeated recommendations and resolutions adopted lately by the Security Council  the International Conference in Support of the Struggle of the Namibian People for Independence s and the Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination"" indicate how concerned the international community is about this crucial situation. These bodies also call on all parties concerned to assume their international responsibilities  particularly those which the five Western Powers took upon themselves in order to solve the question of Namibia and oversee the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which offers the primary basis for the settlement of the problem of Namibia.192.	Kuwait confirms its support for the rights of the black majority in South Africa and its solidarity with it in its bitter struggle against policies of discrimination and affirms its support for and solidarity with the just struggle of the people of Namibia under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative  SWAPO  for independence and self-determination. It also offers us its support for and solidarity with the African front-line States in their struggle against repeated aggression from South Africa.193.	While watching with concern the increasing challenges confronting the international community  Kuwait is very sorry that the area of Central America is now witnessing an aggravated conflict between the two great Powers  the very thing which raises tension in the area. We feel that the problems which confront the States of that area cannot be solved by flexing one's muscles  but rather by supporting honest peaceful initiatives which aim at solving them and by providing economic and social justice to its peoples. We therefore attach special attention to initiatives by the States of the area  particularly the States of the Contadora Group  to put an end to the deteriorating situation and to restore peace and stability to this important part of the world.194.	The currently deteriorating conditions in the world economy are the result of the economic policy practiced by the industrialized nations  which tend to solve their problems in a spirit of individualism  in isolation from the interests of the international community and without taking into consideration the interaction of integrated international economic relations  a prerequisite for a prosperous world economy as a whole. The continuation of such economic policies by the industrialized nations is threatening to lead to a collapse of international economic relations  as well as to confrontation among the industrialized nations themselves on the one hand  and between them and the developing nations on the other. We therefore believe that the advanced nations should revise their negative attitude towards the launching of the global negotiations  which will constitute the proper framework for the creation of the new international economic order.195.	The currently adverse situation of the world economy has left its negative impact even on the petroleum- marketing situation  which in turn affected the countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries by leaving them in a situation where they cannot accept new financial commitments. The increasing cost of development  coupled with the reduction in revenues  has led to the emergence of deficits in the balances of payment of some of those countries and to a lessening of the ability of some of them to secure financial aid. Kuwait therefore feels that no new financial apparatus should be introduced  efforts being concentrated instead on the present apparatus with a view to amending it in such a way as to enable it to adapt to changes in the world economy.196.	In spite of this  Kuwait is doing its best  either alone or in conjunction with the other members of the Gulf Co-operation Council  to help developing nations and increase its co-operation with them.197.	We all have a duty to ease the burden of the developing nations  particularly the least developed among them  since those countries are Suffering from the burdens of accumulated debts  inflation and the escalating prices of imported products.198.	I should like to make clear that Kuwait is fully aware of its responsibility to strengthen economic cooperation among developing nations.199.	It is Kuwait's conviction that concern over the increased hotbeds of tension in the world and the continuation and intensification of international conflicts should not prevent us from considering the greatest danger which threatens world peace and security  namely  the unchecked arms race which threatens the whole world and pushes it towards the edge of the precipice.200.	Kuwait feels that the dawning of a new era of peace  progress and justice for all peoples is still being hindered by the continued escalation and stunning developments in means of mass destruction. Kuwait therefore calls for the full scientific and technological potential  as well as the financial means and human resources  which have so far been directed to armament programmes and military development to be used for peaceful purposes in the service of mankind  which seeks to protect present and future generations and to narrow the gap between the rich countries and those still in the developing stage.201.	Kuwait calls upon the international community to face up to the great challenge presented by the close relationship between disarmament and developmentâa challenge which calls for joint action to meet it.202.	A great number of world leaders having come here to address the General Assembly at its present session  in response to an initiative taken by Mrs. Indira Gandhi  current chairman of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries and President of the Movement's latest summit conference at New Delhi  Kuwait feels that this gathering is in itself an expression of the deep sense of a collective international desire to contribute to the solution of current problems and to support and reassert the principles of truth  justice  peace and coexistence among nations which have become an acceptable framework for joint action. Kuwait hopes therefore that the general debate and bilateral and multilateral meetings among those leaders will offer a good opportunity for a meeting of minds and a determination to start joint action for the good of mankind and peace for humanity.203.	I also pledge to the President of the General Assembly the positive contribution of the delegation of Kuwait in seeking to reach common goals. "
"78",3914,"LAO",38,1983,"ï»¿42.	I should like first to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  sincere congratulations on your brilliant election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. In electing you to this important post  the General Assembly has demonstrated its confidence in and respect for you and your country  Panama  which has constantly opted for a policy of independence and the peaceful settlement of disputes in Central America. I am convinced that under your wise leadership the work of this session will be crowned with success.43.	I should like also to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Imre Hollai  who successfully discharged his functions as President of the thirty-seventh session in spite of many difficulties.44.	It is a particular pleasure for me to congratulate the Secretary-General on his relentless  tireless efforts for peace and international detente.45.	Since the last session of the General Assembly the international climate of detente  peace  security and cooperation has in no way improved; on the contrary the situation has become even more tense.46.	The Government of the United States has striven to increase its military budget and to step up the manufacture of nuclear and conventional weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore  it brought to bear its most eloquent rhetoric in the cause of pushing humanity closer to a nuclear catastrophe. To justify this new escalation in the arms race  it has not shrunk from intensifying the cold war and seeking in every way to sabotage the Soviet- American negotiations at Geneva.47.	The recent case of the South Korean aircraft  which caused such distress because of the loss of lives of its passengers  clearly showed that the United States was knowingly implicated and took advantage of this pretext to pursue its policy of out and out warmongering and diverting opinion from the massive support that had been won by the peace initiatives of the Soviet Union.48.	To attain its objectives it has striven to develop its rapid deployment forces and to build and expand its military bases  particularly in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean  to defend what it describes as its vital interests  to set out  regional command centers and to engage in many kinds of military manoeuvres throughout the world  pursuing its policy of confrontation  threats  interference and aggression in Africa  Asia and Latin America.49.	The aggression against Lebanon and its occupation by the Israeli Zionists and the brutal crimes they have committed against the Palestinian Arab and Lebanese people were carried out with the avowed co-operation of American imperialism. Under the cover of the so-called multinational peace-keeping forces it has used its air and naval forces to interfere directly in Lebanon.50.	The Lao Peopled Democratic Republic strongly condemns these acts and reaffirms its unswerving support for the Palestinian people  struggling under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] for its fundamental rights  including its right to create an independent Palestinian State in its homeland  and it demands that Israel withdraw its troops from Lebanon and from the Arab territories  including the city of Jerusalem  which it has illegally occupied since 1967.51.	An equally unjustified and dangerous action is the American support for the South African racists in prolonging their occupation of Namibia and their continued acts of provocation and sabotage against the African front-line States  particularly Angola and Mozambique. The United States is also engaged in acts of provocation against Libya and shameless interference in the internal affairs of Chad.52.	In Latin America it has imposed a blockade and threatened aggression against Cuba and is seriously interfering in the internal affairs of El Salvador. It is involved in acts of armed provocation and threats of aggression against Nicaragua  Grenada and Suriname  threatening their independence and thus creating a situation which could erupt at any moment.53.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic fully supports the efforts of national defense and socialist construction of the fraternal Cuban people and demands most energetically that the United States abandon its policy of blockade  interference and threats of aggression against the Republic of Cuba  unconditionally  returning Guantanamo to it and respecting its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.54.	We wholeheartedly support the heroic struggle of the governments and peoples of Nicaragua  Grenada and Suriname to protect the fruits of their revolution. We wish to express our great appreciation for the six-point peace proposals made by the Sandinist Government.55.	The collusion between the United States and leading Chinese circles in the pursuit of an undeclared war and their sabotage of the tranquillity and development of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan have constantly maintained tension in the region of southern Asia.56.	In the Far East  the United States maintains its troops in South Korea and is encouraging a revival of Japanese militarism and the creation of an American- Japanese-Korean alliance which would constitute a serious threat to the countries of Asia and the Pacific.57.	In the economic Held the developed capitalist countries are seeking by every possible means to inflict upon the developing countries the fall-out of the economic crisis and are pursuing a policy of protectionism and discrimination in their relations with the poor countries  thus imposing upon them ever-growing difficulties. Global negotiations for international economic co-operation  so long awaited  are not taking place  and the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which met last June at Belgrade  yielded very scanty results because of the intransigent attitude of certain developed capitalist countries.58.	The situation I have described demonstrates that this session of the General Assembly is faced with very important and urgent problems on which rests the fate of the whole of mankind.59.	They are the problems of safeguarding international peace and security  the struggle against the arms race and the danger of a devastating nuclear war and  first and foremost  against the deployment by the United States of medium-range missiles in certain European countries by the end of this year. 60.	They are also the problems of protecting the independence and sovereignty of peoples against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism  apartheid  Zionism  expansionism and hegemonism.61.	They are also the problems of the development of international economic co-operation and the establishment of a new  just and reasonable international economic order based upon respect for the independence and sovereignty of peoples.62.	In this spirit the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic is happy to note that in the past few years the movement of the struggle of the peoples for international peace and security  for the recovery and safeguarding of national independence and economic development has experienced a dynamic upsurge and has become a powerful force capable of averting war and thwarting the unjust policies of the warmongering imperialists and international reactionaries.63.	The just struggle of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America against imperialism  colonialism  neocolonialism  racism and apartheid for freedom and social progress  has received full support from the Lao People's Democratic Republic.64.	We very much appreciate the proposals of the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty held in January 1983 at Prague  reaffirmed by the meeting of the leaders of those countries last June in Moscow  and the new proposals of Mr. Yuri Andropov  the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium   of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union  on the banning of the use of force in outer space and from space against the Earth. These proposals  which demonstrate the high sense of responsibility of the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries regarding international peace and security  have been widely welcomed and supported by peoples throughout the world that cherish peace and justice. In the interest of the whole of mankind  American imperialism and the warmongering forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] should examine these proposals in their entirety.65.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic warmly welcomed the success of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held last March at New Delhi  the final declarations of which is stressed once again the important role of our Movement. At the same time  we wish to express our great appreciation of the role played by India  which under the leadership of its Prime Minister  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  the new Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  works constantly in the common interest of the countries of the Movement.66.	We whole-heartedly support the peoples of El Salvador  Puerto Rico  Chile and Guatemala in their valiant struggle against the interference of the United States and military dictatorships and for true independence and freedom.67.	As to the question of the sovereignty of Argentina over the Malvinas Islands  that country continues to enjoy the sympathy of our people.68.	We energetically support the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  and the people of South Africa  under the leadership of the African National Congress  in their heroic struggle against the racists of South Africa for true independence and freedom. We condemn the attempts of the imperialists and racists of SouthAfrica to link the granting of independence to Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban volunteers from Angola.69.	We stand shoulder to shoulder with the peoples of Angola  Mozambique and the other front-line countries which are fighting against the acts of provocation and armed aggression of the Pretoria racists.70.	The armed provocation against Libya and the violations of its sovereignty by the United States and its tributary forces are energetically condemned by the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  which demands  furthermore  that they cease their interference in the internal affairs of Chad and leave the people of that country to resolve their own internal problems.71.	The Lao delegation supports the struggle of the Saharan Arab people  under the leadership of POLISARIO  for the exercise of its right to self-determination.72.	The struggle of the people of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to protect the gains of the April revolution and to follow the path of national construction it has chosen enjoys our whole-hearted support.73.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic's approval of the proposal to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace goes without saying. We demand that the United States cease to create obstacles to the holding of the international conference on this problem. We support the sovereignty of Mauritius over the island of Diego Garcia and call explicitly upon the United States to dismantle its base there.74.	We strongly support the proposals of the Mongolian People's Republic concerning the conclusion of an international convention on non-aggression and on the non- use of force in international relations among the countries of Asia and the Pacific.75.	We whole-heartedly support the struggle of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification and independence of that country. The United States must withdraw all its troops from the southern part of Korea.76.	South-East Asia  which I would like to dwell on in particular  is by virtue of its geopolitical and strategic situation a part of the world which unfortunately has become the object of the greed of the imperialists and the Chinese expansionists. In spite of the failure of their policy of interference and aggression  the latter have not given up their machinations aimed at absorbing the three Indo-Chinese countries as part of their expansionist designs concerning the whole of South-East Asia. They strive constantly to maintain a constant state of tension along the Chinese-Lao and Chinese-Viet Nam frontiers  where their troops are stepping up their acts of armed provocation and sabotage of all kinds  and also along the Thai-Kampuchean frontier  where  in collusion with the American imperialists and Thai reactionary forces  they are using Thai territory as a base for feeding  arming and training the rump of the Pol Pot troops and a handful of Khmer reactionaries to undermine the process of the revival of the Kampuchean people. It thus becomes unmistakably clear that China is behind the deterioration of peace and security in South-East Asia and the hostility between the members of ASEAN and the countries of Indo-China.77.	After having won victories in the national liberation struggle against the imperialists  and having thwarted the policy of interference  aggression and annexation of Chinese leading circles  the three Indo-Chinese countries have no other aspiration than to live in peace so as to staunch the wounds of war  reconstruct their countries  build a new life and establish relations of friendship with all their neighbours  including the People's Republic of China. The people of Laos  like the people of Viet Nam and Kampuchea  have always cultivated an age-old friendship with the Chinese people and have spared no effort to promote such friendship. The three countries of Indo-china have repeatedly expressed their wish to sign treaties of peaceful coexistence with China and to normalize relations with that country.78.	As far as the ASEAN countries are concerned  the Lao delegation is happy to note a certain willingness to begin a dialogue. It is highly desirable that this willingness take concrete form. As for the three countries of Indo-China  they have spared no effort to promote such dialogue with a view to making South-East Asia a zone of peace  stability  friendship and co-operation. Accordingly  at their first summit conference  held in February of this year at Vientiane  high-level representatives of Laos  Kampuchea and Viet Nam reaffirmed that: relations of friendship and co-operation among the countries of Indo-China and the ASEAN countries are an important factor for preserving peace and stability in South-East Asia. They should settle all differences through negotiation in a spirit of good neighbourhood  coexist in peace . . . They should not let outside countries interfere and divide them or use the territory of one against another.  [-SecAs in the past  Laos  Kampuchea an Viet Nam remain and will remain resolutely faithful to this course.79.	Thus  the withdrawal of volunteers of the Vietnamese army from Kampuchea  which has already taken place on two occasions  is a token of the seriousness of our intent and demonstrates the consistent position of Viet Nam in respect of the independence and sovereignty of that country.80.	In the course of their seventh conference held last July at Phnom Penh  the Foreign Ministers of Laos  Kampuchea and Viet Nam once again repeated their proposals for the restoration of peace and co-operation in South-East Asia and invited the ASEAN countries and China to embark without delay on the process of dialogue and negotiation	in accordance  with the spirit and letter of the statement on South-East Asia of the seventh conference of the non-aligned countries  held last March at New Delhi. The three countries of Indo-China are ready  on the basis of this statement  to proceed with discussions with their neighbours without preconditions. To demonstrate their good will  they have even accepted the formula of the ASEAN countries for a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  as a basis for dialogue.81.	As to the problem of the participation of these two groups of countriesâIndo-China and ASEANâin dialogue  as well as the agenda of the meeting  they should be the subject of an agreement between the two parties. In this regard  the People's Republic of Kampuchea made it explicitly known that it has no intention of making its participation a precondition or obstacle to the opening of the dialogue. The Lao delegation believes that this is an important new and very constructive factor which should give an impetus to dialogue between the two groups of countries.82.	Another new element is the statement on the problems of South-East Asia adopted by consensus at the conference of the non-aligned countries  including the problem of Kampuchea and its vacant seat.83.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic considers that the two resolutions constitute a good basis for making progress towards the settlement of the problems between the two groups of countries and for making South-East Asia a zone of peace and stability.84.	As for the seat of Kampuchea in the United Nations  we regret that the Organization continues to allow it to be occupied by the architects of genocide  Pol Pot and Ieng Sary  under the label of the so-called  Government of Coalition of Democratic Kampuchea . On the other hand we wish to salute the good will shown by the People's Republic of Kampuchea  the sole legitimate representative of the Kampuchean people  which has already stated that it does not intend immediately to occupy the seat when  Democratic Kampuchea  is expelled from the United Nations.85.	In consideration of the good will thus manifested by the countries of Indo-China  we hope that the United Nations will reconsider its position on the Kampuchean problem so that it can justify the confidence placed in it as the guardian of peace under the Charter and that it will give a positive impetus to dialogue on the problem.86.	The Lao people  a small people which loves peace  independence and liberty and whose wish is to live in peace and good-neighborliness with all neighbouring countries so that it may devote itself entirely to the development of its country  does not constitute a threat to any one. It is  however  highly regrettable that certain neighbouring countries still consider my country as a target to be destroyed  so that our relations are affected and have deteriorated without any prospects of improvement. On the Chinese-Lao frontier  Chinese troops have massed and have undertaken military exercises  made arrests and executed our frontier guards  have sent spies into Laotian territory and have engaged in propaganda hostile to the policy of the Lao Government and in divisive manoeuvres among the population  and so forth. What is even more dangerous  the Peking leaders are currently maintaining  in Yunan Province in southern China  a certain number of military training centers for Lao refugees  in particular the Hmong reactionaries  in order to send them into Lao territory to carry out acts of sabotage and disrupt public order.87.	These actions form part of the implementation of the expansionist and hegemonist policy of the Peking leaders with regard to Indo-China and South-East Asia as a whole.88.	In its relations with the Kingdom of Thailand  the Lao People's Democratic Republic signed the joint Lao- Thailand communiquÃ© in 1979 to strengthen bilateral relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and to transform the Mekong  in the section that forms the frontier between the two countries  into a river of friendship  peace and co-operation. Over the last few years  not only has the Thai administration failed to abide by its commitments in good faith  but some of its leaders who support the American imperialists and the Chinese expansionists have been using Thai territory as a sanctuary to train Lao reactionaries in their work of sabotage against the development of Laos  thus impairing the traditional relations of friendship between the two peoples of Thailand and Laos and working against the interests of the two countries. In the interests of the Thai people and in the interests of friendship between the people of Thailand and Laos  those holding power in Thailand should scrupulously implement the joint communiquÃ© issued by the two countries and seek a settlement of their differences with Laos by means of negotiation.89.	As regards the United States  it continues  always in collusion with the Chinese expansionists and other reactionary forces  to aid and abet the Lao reactionaries in exile in Thailand  to carry out acts of provocation  to interfere in the internal affairs of Laos and to utter slanderous accusations against its Government about the use of chemical weapons against these bandits  charges which are renewed each year in the General Assembly. Nevertheless  the Lao Government  anxious to respect friendly relations with the American people and with the worthy aim of normalizing Lao-American relations  has during the year authorized a certain number of American official missions to visit Laos  but to our regret these have led to no concrete results.90.	Faced with the situation I have described  we believe that the international community should do everything in its power to help make South-East Asia a zone of peace  stability and co-operation.91.	The Lao delegation wishes to take this opportunity to express from this rostrum the profound gratitude of the Government and people of Laos for the sympathy and support which friendly countries and international organizations in the world have given to the defence and construction of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.92.	The thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly has opened in a climate of international tension  a matter of some concern to progressive mankind.93.	Never has the fight to halt the arms race and promote disarmament  to fight the danger of nuclear war and to promote detente and peace  been such a categorical imperative as it is at present.94.	Never has the fight to overcome imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  domination and exploitation  and to promote independence  freedom and national sovereignty been waged so fiercely and energetically as now.95.	Never have the tasks of economic development and the struggle to establish a new international economic order  more just and equitable  become such urgent and important topics in international life as they are now.96.	Never have the struggles for peace  independence and economic development been so intimately linked  so much the main concerns of the international community  as now. It is quite clear that the deepest aspirations of mankind today centre on peace  national independence  social progress  prosperity  friendship and international co-operation.97.	I with to issue an appeal from this rostrum to all Members of the Organization  to the President of the General Assembly and to the Secretary-General to spare no effort to ensure that this session lives up to the profound hopes of the peoples of the world for international peace and security.98.	For its part  the Lao People's Democratic Republic will do everything in its power  together with other Member States  to co-operate in that endeavour. 	"
"79",3959,"LBN",38,1983,"ï»¿288.	 I wish first to thank allheads of delegation who have spoken with empathy andwith concern for my country  Lebanon. I sincerely hopethat a reunited and reinvigorated Lebanon will promotethe greaI1 am pleased to congratulate the President on hiselection to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session. Mycongratulations acquire special significance in view of theclose relations existing between our two countries  as wellas the traditional ties of friendship and co-operationthat characterize relations between Latin America andLebanon.I wish to express appreciation to the President'spredecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the able manner inWhich he presided over the thirty-seventh session.291.	I also wish to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General for Ms dedicated work on behalf of peace. Hisclear vision of the international community and of theUnited Nations peace-keeping and peace-keeping capacities  his human and diplomatic Qualities and theCompetent way in which he guides the work of the Organization is alt worthy of our highest esteem.292.	My delegation has carefully studied the report ofthe Secretary-General on the work of the OrganizationWe express our support for the valuable comments and observations in this report  especially thoserelating to the endeavours to enhance the effectivenessof the Security Council and strengthen the United Nationspeace-keeping operations  whose missions and objectivesare set by the Security Council.293.	My delegation specifically supports the Secretary-General's proposal to dispatch fact-finding missions toareas of tension  to prevent possible conflicts which couldendanger international peace and security.294.	Our agenda this year is replete with increasinglycomplex and still unresolved problems affecting internal-tonal peace. Lebanon  a founding member of the UnitedNations and a nation sensitive to the problems of othernations  finds itself once more In the vortex of the storm.We are therefore compelled to focus on our own problems  sine it is our nation's very existence that is in danger.295.	One year ago  at the thirty-seventh session  President Amin Gemmate stated here:""... we have had enough; enough of bloodshed enough of destruction  enough of dislocation anddespond. We have paid the high price of war. We shouldnot pay an additional price for Pease. As a Memberof the United Nations we want our rights to be restoredto us."" This appeal of yesterday is still our appeal of today  forwe Lebanese desperately need peace and security withfreedom and justice. Furthermore  it is our right  indeedour responsibility  to explain our case to the Assemblyand to absolve ourselves before the court of history  lestmisunderstanding of the Lebanese problem usher theregion into a war that could threaten the existing orderin the globally pivotal Middle East.296.	There is a great deal of ideological propaganda thatinsists that Lebanon will always be in turmoil  that Lebanon can never contribute to civilized and purposefullives. Those who maintain these absurdities see theirinterests best served in conflict and confrontation; theywould feel lost and purposeless in a society of civilized co-operative and peace-loving nations. They insist thatLebanon will always remain intractable  hoping therebyto dissuade the United Nations from exercising its peaceful role or friendly Powers from extending a sympathetic helping hand.297.	In the face of this propaganda and through eightyears of bloodshed  economic ruin and foreign intervention of every sort  it is proof of our inevitable viabilityas a nation that no Lebanese faction has ever entertainedthe idea of partition or secession. The Lebanese peopleare absolutely committed to a unified and independentLebanon. What the Lebanese people share is a precious?experience in democratic government  unique in the Arabworld. Until war broke out  Lebanon was the culturaland economic capital of the Middle East  the meetingplace of Arab and Western intellectuals  the centre forinternational trade and a precocious exampleof successful  peaceful democratic government.298.	I i975  as the society of civilized States lookedon  this young democracy succumbed to a host of Arab-Israeli  inter-Arab and East-West tensions. To be sure Lebanon  take other heterogeneous societies  had its shareof internal tensions  but the virtue of democracy is thatit can remind these tensions peacefully  unlike other formsof government which can only resist and suppress them.299.	We stand before the world asking for an opportunity to be left to ourselves in order to allow our democratic ways to resolve the tensions in our nation. Thisrequest is in no way Utopian or unreasonable  for manyof the oldest and most stable Member States of theOrganizationâEuropean  Asian and Americanâhaveexperienced similarly tumultuous and dangerous periodsin their past as they forged heterogeneous populationsinto unified  modern nation States. Thus  in addition toour courage  determination and faith  historical precedentis on our side.300.	in Lebanon  a pluralistic society is attempting toreach mature nationhood. The contours of religions andfaiths are being redefined in order to conform to therequirements of the modern State. The political philosophy of a traditional society is adjusting to the realtiesof super-Power conflict  pervasive ideologies  supranational mass movements and modern military threats.of Host third world nations  and to understand andsuccessfully treat the problems of Lebanon would be toavert similar uncertainty and conflict in the third worldof the next few decades.30. Lebanon today finds itself occupied by three regular armies and by surrogate fighting forces attached tothese armies. Israel occupies about one third of Lebaneseterritory  in the area under its control it raises local armiesand militias; it trains them  equips them and providesthem with logistical support. Israel declares to the worldthat it understands Lebanon and wants to save it  yet itproceeds to act in a manner that wilts idea to its destruction. To the Jewish people  who have tasted the bitterpill of destruction  we now proclaim in this internationalforum ""Let your actions match your words. You wantedsecurity for your northern frontiers. You have got thatsecurity in the proposed agreement"". In the light ofemerging political facts we urge Israel to reconsider theobstacles which are making the implementation of theagreement difficult.302. Syria effectively controls about one half of Lebanese territory. Its army no longer enjoys the umbrella oflegitimacy that the Lebanese Government had providedsince 1976. No one will deny that Syrian forces haveplayed a balancing role in the past in the raging international conflicts fought on Lebanese territory  but this isno longer the case. The prolongation of a Syrian militarypresence In Lebanon is likely to exacerbate relationsbetween Lebanon and Syria  and It works to the disadvantage of both  in the Syrian-held territory of Lebanon Palestinians  Iranians  Libyans and a number of localorganizations  armed and directed by the Syrians  havebeen pitted against the forces of the legitimately Constituted Government. Clearly  Syria and Lebanon havemany inseparable interests  some of which have increasedgreatly in the past seven years. Cleary  the relationsbetween Lebanon and Syria were and still are destinedto be qualitatively closer than the relations between Lebanon and any other country in the Middle East. Lebanonhas made it abundantly clear that it intends to cultivatethese relations  to address our common interests and towork with Syria in the promotion of ideals which thepeoples of the two countries share. Now Lebanon callsupon Syria to extend a helping hand  to give meaningand substance to the bond of brotherhood that ties theArab States toga her. We expect Syria to withdraw itsforces in a manner that will promote Lebanon's sovereignty while at the same time addressing Syria's security constant.Ian the north and near Baalbek in the east. Together with Other elements and some local militias supported by external forces  they were directly Involved infighting the Lebanese Army and in preventing it fromextending its authority in the area recently evacuated bythe Israelis. Since 1970 Lebanon has been the base formilitary actions by the PLO against Israel  actions whichled to successive air raids by Israel and two invasions ofLebanon  in 1978 and 1982  the second of which led toIsraeli occupation of south Lebanon. The Lebanese  morethan any other people in the Arab world  gave the Palestinians the opportunity to experiment with all types ofmethodologies to reclaim their legitimate rights. If theyhave failed to do so it is not for lack of good will on thepart of Lebanon. Now  however  neither Lebanon northe Palestinians wishes to perpetuate a tragedy whichmay translate itself into havoc not only for the Lebanesebut also for the Palestinian civilian population in Lebanon as well. We therefore call on the PLO to reciprocatethe good will it has enjoyed from the Lebanese by withdrawing its fighters  as its leaders had agreed to do. Tothe Palestinians whose presence in Lebanon is legal wesay that we recommit ourselves to them in this worldforum and reaffirm that they wish enjoy all rights andprivileges provided by the taw. They will thus be able toresume a normal and secure item  unequalled in its freedom and its cultural implications in any other countryof the Middle East.304.	Thus a Lebanon afflicted by forces from beyondits frontiers proclaims to the Assembly in word and indeed its readiness to accommodate what these forcesclaim to be equitable  fair and just to them. We are readyto reason with alt  clinging to what is our own  whileallowing to the limits of rationally and liberality whatothers claim to be their interest in what is our own.305.	Because of our legal rights under the Charter ofthe United Nations  under international law and underthe rules of civilized existence  we feel justified in callingupon the moral conscience of mankind  representedin the Assembly  to save this valiant and beleaguereddemocracy.307.	Lebanon  because of its pluralistic society  itsdemocratic form of government and its geographicallocation  has become the centre of conflicting policies inthe region. Revolutionary Arab States exploited Lebanon's pluralisticstructure and encouraged the rise of movements andparties whose objectives were in conflict with the broad-based consensus on which the Lebanese pluralistic  demo-critic order is based.309. When others were busy mobilizing masses  buildingarmies and concentrating power in ruling Elites  the Lebanese were contributing to peace and excelling in tradeand finance  in education and health and in the promotion of the arts and the fine things of life. Perhaps in ailthis we underestimated the necessity of building a strongState  strong institutions and a strong national army.Lebanon's sin  if sin it be  is that it was too free in a regionwhere freedom was not appreciated  too Iberia in a regionknown for its powerful regimes and too permissive of actsand thoughts that openly sought to undermine the verysystem that nurtured them.310. it has now learned its lesson. it will continue tocherish freedom  but will not permit it to deteriorate intoanarchy; it will continue to uphold Iberia  pluralisticvalues but not at the expense of a strong and vibrantnation State; it will tolerate  at indeed cultivate  diversity of thought and organization  but within the dear cut confines of the unity of the State  the unity of thepeople and the unity of governmental institutions.3. Lebanon's wars is a regional war with internationaldimensions. The different communities of Lebanon wereforced by political and military facts costing about themto take sides. n conflicts involving the Israelis  the Palestinians and the Syrians  virtually no community wasallowed the freedom to be truly neutral and truly Lebanese. Only after the battier had raged for some time didthe Lebanese begin to realize what was actually happeningoh their land. When the realization was complete  theyrallied to the cause of Lebanon and tried to extricate itfrom the web of forces in which it had become entangled.Accordingly the duly elected Parliament  one of the fewtruly representative parliaments in the Middle East  freelyand unanimously elected Amin Gemayel to the presidency. The Parliament represents all communities  allregions  all political trends in the country. When Lebanonsigned an agreement regarding the withdrawal of Israeliforces from Lebanon  only two members of Parliamentcast their votes against it. An impressive national consensus exists to end the wars of others on our land  toremove all non-Lebanese forces from the country and tostand behind the President in his efforts to liberate  uniteand develop Lebanon.312.	A year ago we asked the Twelfth Arab SummitConference  held at Fez  to acknowledge Lebanon's decision to remove Israeli  Syrian and PLO forces from Lebanon. In early spring we asked the Seventh Conferenceof Heads of state or Government of Non-Aligned Counties  at New Delhi  to support Lebanon's right to get ailnon-Lebanese forces out of the country. The agreementreached in May 1983 between Lebanon and Israel underUnited States sponsorship requires Israel to withdrawfully from Lebanon. Recently  President Gemayel sent letters to President Assad and to Mr. Arafat asking themto withdraw their armed forces from Lebanon.313.	The Security Council has repeatedly reaffirmed ourright to extend our sovereignty throughout our land. SinceUS the United Nations has maintained UNIFIL in thesouth  a force which against heavy odds has upheldLebanon legitimate rights in the area of its operation providing security and hope to the local population. Tothe counters contributing to this force we express ourdeep gratitude.314.	We are deeply grateful to the United States France  Italy and the United Kingdom for their peace-keeping forces in our country and for the support theyare giving the Government in attaining its broad objectives. Lebanon must pay a special tribute to PresidentReagan  who has wholeheartedly committed himself tohelping Lebanon regain its unity  sovereignty and independence. In the past week the efforts of the United Statesand of Saudi Arabia  in quiet and intensive diplomacybetween Beirut and Damascus  have led to a cease-firewhich we hope will end the bloodshed and start thepolitical process of conciliating conflicts and interests.We are grateful to the United States and to Saudi Arabiaand to their able diplomats who worked tirelessly inachieving the cease-fire. We now look to the UnitedNations to help us establish the mechanism that canadequately supervise it. We hope that this urgent andhumane objective will have the enthusiastic support ofail Members of the Organization.315. In short  Lebanon's message to the General Assembly is this: help us remove all non-Lebanese forces fromour country  and Lebanon on its own will resolve itsinternal tensions and resume its valuable position as acontributor to world peace and international prosperity both cultural and economic.316.	The Middle East is undoubtedly a region fraughtwith conflicts  but of all the problems of the region theLebanese problem is the most crucial and therefore themost urgent. The Iran-Iraq war poses a danger to thestability of the Oaf. Soviet-American rivalry in theMiddle East endangers the delicate international balanceof power. The Palestinian problem poses a threat to peacein the Arab East. The Arab-Israel problem threatens theState system in the region. And  finally  there is theproblem of radical minority movements and the dangerthey pose to a stable social order in the area.317.	If dialogue and diplomacy can succeed in Lebanonthis success will breed other successes  and the parties tothe effort Will gain credibility and momentum and go onto resolve other problems. If Lebanon fails  every societyfrom Morocco in the west to the Guff States in the eastwill be threatened. Now the world looks on as the battierbetween order and anarchy rages; every regime in theregion awaits its outcome. If there is any crisiswhose consequences spies the beginning or the end of anera  it is the Lebanese crisis. In a the historical senseLebanon's crisis is axial and future events will be judgedby what was done or left undone at this juncture.318.	Lebanon is doing the impose within the limitedmeans at its disposal. The Government exercises effectivecontrol over barely 15 per cent of the territory  and yetthe people  irrespective of the force that exercises controlover them  are overwhelmingly with the Government.President Gemayel has called again and again on allleaders of the opposition to joining a dialogue that willestablish the precipices on which the new Lebanon willbe founded. Now a dialogue committee has been established and efforts are under way to convene it as soonas possible. The stage has been set for the formation ofa Government of national unity and the opposition hasbeen invited to participate in it.319.	We have in the past year built an army committedto the impartial defence of the entire Lebanese polity  anarmy of all the people  for all the people. The cohesionof the army in the past month is a reflection of thecohesion that holds Lebanese society together irrespectiveby outsiders. We have given peace and order to the cityof Beirut  the only area exclusively under Governmentauthority. Where the Government holds sway  the different communities in peace as one family  and no one looks askance at his neighbour.320.	In speaking to the Assembly about Lebanon I amspeaking of a subject not unfamiliar to representatives.For over 100 years Lebanese have been emigrating to theFar East  to South-East Asia  to Australia  to New Zealand  to Africa  to the Americas and  more recently  toEurope at the Gulf States. Ambitious and daring Lebanese have been responsible for great intellectual  artisticand developmental achievements in the new lands thatthey have made their homes. In most of the countriesrepresented in the Assembly Lebanese hold key positionsin government  education and business. They left theirnative country in search of a dream  the dream of excelling and of giving their progeny more  much more  thanthey had themselves. I also know  however  of the dreamsof the Lebanese today in the tortured land of Lebanon.They are simple dreams. Most representatives would besurprised that they are called dreams at all. Tate Lebanesedream of leading simple  ordinary lives. They dream ofreturning to their cities  to their towns  to their visages.They dream of opening their shops in the morning andclosing them in the evening. They dream of harvestingtheir crops  of sending their children to school and ofwelcoming them home in the evening. They dream ofpeaceful walks to the village spring. They dream ofgathering as the sun goes down at recounting ordinarystories and ordinary events in an ordinary life. Theydream of what others take for granted.321.	I bring with me the aspirations of a beleagueredpeople. My voice encompasses the voice of tens of thousands of men  women and children who have lost theirlives in a merciless international conflict.322.	What I ask of the international community assembled in this Hall is to help the Lebanese nation securethe normal  the minimum  conditions of national existence. The Lebanese people themselves are anxious toachieve the rest. The Lebanese are a capable  inventiveand industrious people. They will not succumb to therages of international chaos and conflict but will moulda stronger and deeper national entity out of the sufferingthat they have endured. We like to think that we are notalone in this struggle  and we look to our brothers in thesociety of nations for encouragement  assistance andsupport. "
"80",4004,"LBR",38,1983,"ï»¿We live in a world of constant transformation  where even the ideals that motivate mankind have been rapidly changing. Yet those visions of national identity  freedom  justice and equality and the aspiration to a better standard of living tend more and more to dominate the human horizon.My own country  the Republic of Liberia  grew out of these compelling human hopes and aspirations. However  the expression of these aspirations has become increasingly frustrated over the years. Thus it was not by accident that  three years ago  the enlisted men and women of the armed forces of Liberia ushered in our popular revolution. Our primary objective has been the building of a new society based on justice  equality  freedom and equal opportunity for all of our citizens.We note that the historical antagonism between the settlers and indigenous elements manifested itself at the onset of the revolution. However  we have always kept in focus the need to narrow the economic and social disparities within Liberian society and to promote genuine national unity.Barely three years after coming to power we can proudly boast of having no political prisoners in our country. We have endeavored to pursue conscientiously a policy which guards against the abuse of human rights.We now stand proudly at the dawn of a national rebirth  as we have moved steadily ahead in our constitutional process for a return of the country to civilian rule in 1985.Looking forward to a new era of confidence and accommodation at home  I appear before the Assembly today as the first indigenous head of State of the Republic of Liberia  a country which has stood for over a century as the symbol of Africa's invincible soul and the flame of Africa's resurgence.We have come with pride to speak not of conflict but of reconciliation; not of division  but of unity; not of hatred but of love; not of war but of peace; not of action based on self-interest but of genuine co-operation based on a vision of global development.Our presence here is a reflection of our profound sense of the historical significance of Liberia's role in world affairs. For in the span of time since we assumedpower  we have experienced dramatic civil stress and economic frustrations  yet we have realized tremendous national success.Our people have made significant advances from the grip of servitude on to frontiers of dignity  from the deep paths of exploitation on to the councils of human upliftment. However  we do not see this new emergence only as the attainment of an inheritance long denied; we see it also as a challenge to rekindle that vision which united the various elements of the Liberian population over 130 years ago. All of our people have  therefore  been propelled to rise from a state of slumber to make a truly unique Liberian contribution to international peace and understanding in a troubled world. There is a new momentum of activity within our embrace  born of uncertainties but crowned with opportunities. We shall strive for unity at home  solidarity in Africa and peace throughout the world.It is with pleasure  therefore  that we extend a hearty welcome to the State of Saint Christopher and Nevis  which has been admitted to the Organization as the 158th Member.We wish to express to Mr. Jorge Illueca  a distinguished son of Panama  sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the Assembly. His outstanding ability and his vast experience as a diplomat and statesman assure us that under Ms leadership the Assembly will face up to the great challenge of promoting peace and protecting the welfare of mankind everywhere.We wish to record a well-deserved tribute also to his outstanding predecessor  who presided with such wisdom over the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His performance won for him the great approbation and esteem of ail.At the same time  we express commendation to the Secretary-General for the very effective and conscientious manner in which he has performed his duties since his election. We urge that he be given all necessary support in his efforts to reorganise and strengthen our cherished Organization. Let me reaffirm the continued support and co-operation of the Government of Liberia as he performs his duties.The search for peace  the most important mission of this great Organization  remains a major preoccupation of mankind. Yet  reflecting upon events of the recent past  we must make the sad admission that peace continues to elude us. Violence and terrorism  undeclared war and rumours of war  social injustices and fanatic actions undermine the restraint and moderation which should characterize contemporary international relations.The shooting down of an unarmed Korean commercial aircraft by the Soviet Union  killing all 269 passengers and crew members  is a cruel act against humanity. It is in contravention of established and accepted rules of international law and civil aviation regulations. Such action reflects a sad spectre of the dangerous extent to which order and harmony in inter-State relations have eroded. Our world map is checkered with flashpoints and areas of tension. In Africa  Chadians are locked in a bitter civil war  aided by those bent on subverting the sovereignty of that African State. In southern Africa  the diabolical system of apartheid still survives  while the national independence of Namibia is being delayed by South Africa's intransigence.In the Middle East  hopes for the reconstruction of Lebanon and the full restoration of Lebanese sovereignty are being frustrated by the renewed intensification of fighting  principally among the Lebanese themselves. This situation poses a dangerous threat to world peace and stability. We are therefore pleased by the news of the cease-fire just announced in Lebanon. We congratulate President Gemayel  the Lebanese people  the Saudis  and all other parties concerned on this development. We hope it will be the beginning of permanent peace in that war- torn country.Nevertheless  the Iran-Iraq war continues  now in its third year. Already  untold numbers of men  women and children have perished  and billions of dollars' worth of property have been lost in that senseless and protracted conflict.In Asia  the people of Afghanistan continue to wage a valiant struggle for their freedom and independence from foreign domination.Also  a just and lasting political settlement has not been found to the problem of Kampuchea  and the sovereignty  independence and non-aligned status of that country remain compromised by the presence of foreign troops.In Latin America  the situations in El Salvador and Nicaragua continue to undermine peace and stability in that region.23. These developments point to a disquieting trend in international relations. If unchecked  they could lead towards a global disaster with the potential of causing greater horrors and sufferings for mankind. We must realize that terror and intransigence are inimical to productive interdependence; we must utilize our precious and limited resources for the good of mankind  rather than for the promotion of conflict and violence. The voice of Liberia  the oldest independent African Republic  singularly rang out for many years  from these very halls  pleading for freedom and liberation for Africans and all peoples still under colonial domination. We therefore feel it incumbent upon us to call again on the international community to give every support to the freedom fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization	and to speed up the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) for the independence of Namibia. With respect to the Middle East  my Government recently took the decision to resume diplomatic relations with the State of Israel  at the ambassadorial level. In 1973  Liberia felt obliged to join other member States of the Organization of African Unity in severing relations with Israel  in solidarity with Egypt  a member of the OAU whose territory had been forcibly occupied by Israel. That decision was taken because of our strong opposition to the acquisition of territory by force of arms and in consideration of our role as a member of the OAU. We believe that the condition for a continued break in relations with Israel no longer exists. The occupied Egyptian territory has been restored to Egyptian sovereigntyâ significantly  through negotiations between Egypt and Israel. The two countries have  further  established diplomatic relations and have exchanged ambassadors. Thus  we believe that a policy of the continued isolation of Israel is no longer useful in the search for peace in the Middle East. We are convinced that it is now time to start a new momentum for peace in that region. Thus  during our visit to the State of Israel last month  we told our hosts of the need for a decisive move towards mutual recognition on the part of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]. We also expressed the conviction that  in order to achieve a lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem  the terms of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) must be fully implemented. If genuine peace is to be achieved in the Middle East  we believe that due recognition must be given to the rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to a State of their own. We live in a rapidly changing world. We therefore cannot and must not take refuge in the buried past. With new expressions of modem anxieties  we cannot and must not take comfort in a complacent present. We must not allow ourselves to be held to ransom by hatred  mistrust and suspicion. Let us keep our perspective towards the building of a more dynamic future  responsive to living realities  not hopeless illusions. It must be a future which is more realistic  with positive responses  not threatening consequences. It is encouraging to note from recent reports that there are positive signs of a recovery by the industrial economies. However  we reject the notion that such a recovery  by itself  can lead the world economy out of the present crisis. We are convinced that the problems of the present world economic system are structural in nature and require determined and concerted global solutions. It was in this connection that my Government expressed dismay at the less than satisfactory outcome of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which convened at Belgrade in June this year. Therefore  in the spirit of the Declaration adopted by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983  and the Buenos Aires Platform of the Group of 77 ' we urge the Assembly to take the necessary action for the launching of the global round of negotiations. Meanwhile  we insist on the adoption of a programme of immediate measures in areas of critical importance to the developing countries  including finance  trade  raw materials  energy and food  in order to stimulate economic growth in those countries. At the same time  we urge the continued intensification of efforts for South-South co-operation within the framework of collective self-reliance. In this increasingly interdependent world  the economic development and political stability of developed and developing countries have become inter-linked. Development requires an atmosphere of peace  but peace cannot be maintained for long when there is a widening gap between an affluent few and a vast majority that survives on the edge of poverty and deprivation. Thus we cannot over-emphasize the urgent need to halt the arms race and divert needed resources to constructive use for the betterment of mankind. When we assumed power  the Liberian economy was in shambles. We inherited a staggering debt burden where funds borrowed were invested largely in unproductive and prestigious projects. Also  many of the loans were obtained on short-term commercial arrangements. In addition  there has been a collapse of demand in world markets for Liberia's principal export products  while the country has also experienced a flight of capital. With overall stagnation  a decline in economic activity  critically rising unemployment  decreasing revenue and an increasing fuel import bill  the country lacks the means to pay for essential imports of food and other commodities. Moreover  the country has very little infrastructure  inadequate housing  a poor health delivery system and a very high illiteracy rate. It is against that background that we have appealed to the international community for urgently needed assistance. We wish  on behalf of the People's Redemption Council  the Government and people of the Republic of Liberia  to express deep appreciation to all those Member States of this world body that have responded positively to our appeal. We should also like to thank the World Bank  UNDP and all international organizations and institutions for their assistance. For our part  we have felt that the recovery of our economy and the development of our country are first and foremost the responsibility of every Liberian. We view external assistance only as a means to supplement our own efforts. Thus  we have instituted drastic cost-saving and revenue-generating measures. In spite of those measures  the economic situation of Liberia remains critical. In recognition of the magnitude of our economic problem  the General Assembly  at its thirty-sixth session  adopted resolution 36/207 requesting the Secretary- General  among other things  to dispatch an inter-agency mission to Liberia. The mission was sent in March 1982 and produced a report describing Liberia's immediate needs for financial assistance. It also emphasized the critical requirements for rehabilitating and consolidating the Liberian economy and strengthening its infrastructure. At its thirty-seventh session the General Assembly  on the basis of the report  adopted a follow-up resolution  calling for the convening of a roundtable conference of donors for Liberia. The conference is scheduled to take place from 24 to 27 October 1983 at Geneva  under the auspices of UNDP. A document for participants in the conference has been prepared by UNDP in collaboration with the Liberian Government. It indicates that over the next three financial years  total aid disbursement requirements will amount to $975 million. Of that amount  $356 million will be needed for direct balance of payments support. The rest will go towards public investment and technical assistance to stimulate renewed economic activity. We express our deep gratitude to the Secretary- General  the Under-Secretary-General for Special Political Questions  the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme and the members of the interagency mission  who have contributed to the organization of this conference. We also extend appreciation to all friendly Governments  donor agencies and institutions for their assistance in this undertaking. We now extend a sincere invitation and indeed appeal to members of the international community fully to participate in the conference and help us arrest the downward trend in the Liberian economy. I could not conclude this intervention without reaffirming my country's commitment to the principles and goals of the United Nations. As a founding Member  Liberia remains convinced of the soundness of its guiding principles and ideals. Whatever its weaknesses  we believe it is our best hope for world peace and security. It is the duty of each of us  its Member States  to ensure that the United Nations system works. In this connection  we wish to express our concern over the manner in which the veto is used by the big Powers in the Security Council. The exercise of the veto was intended to provide a system of checks and balances and to preserve the integrity of the Organization. However  it has often been misused by the major Powers to enhance their own self-interest. This situation tends to prevent the vast majority of Member States from effectively participating in the decision-making process of that important organ of the United Nations. It seems to reduce the rest of us in the world body to the status of mere observers  with only a voice but no vote. We therefore call for an urgent review of the veto power and a reformation of the decision-making process in the Security Council. Liberia will continue to pursue a foreign policy designed to foster international peace and goodwill. We shall not relent in our support of the drive to put the scarce resources of the world to positive and constructive use and harness its energies  through unity and reconciliation among people  through accommodation and co-operation among nations  through the practice of love and the pursuit of peace  for the building of a more prosperous and just world order. Let us  at this session  take a step in this direction by producing decisions and resolutions that will be geared towards roiling back the ever-expanding wasteland of poverty  misery and deprivation in our world."
"81",4050,"LBY",38,1983,"ï»¿144.	 Sir  I wish at the outset to congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is satisfied at having you direct the proceedings  in view of your acknowledged wisdom  experience and ability  which justify your assumption of your responsibilities and also because you represent a country with which my country maintains the best of relations.145.	I cannot fail at this moment to express my appreciation and congratulations to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  the head of the delegation of the friendly republic of Hungary  on the outstanding manner and the unmatched skill with which he guided the Assembly's work during the thirty-seventh session  146.	I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General for his efforts to promote the role of the United Nations and to enhance its efficiency.147.	My delegation also has the pleasure of congratulating Saint Christopher and Nevis on attaining independence and welcomes its admission to membership of the United Nations.148.	The thirty-eighth session is meeting against a background of critical international developments  characterized by a worsening atmosphere of confrontation  the exacerbation of several world political  economic and social crises and strenuous efforts by colonial and imperialist Powers to return to the old spheres of influence and to gain hegemony over new ones. Moreover  there has been an increasing sense of insecurity among nations of the world because of the policies adopted by the colonial Powers. These are based on gunboat diplomacy and the resulting creation of hotbeds of tension and international disputes. There is also the intensification of colonial military build-ups with a view to using them in the service of colonialist States  thus destabilizing many regions in the world  and in acts of aggression perpetrated against independent countries in order to intimidate their peoples and prevent them from utilizing their resources in development and progress.149.	An assessment of events since the thirty-seventh session will undoubtedly explain why all international efforts and attempts to reach solutions for many of the current international issues have resulted in nothing but frustration. We have witnessed the persistence of old hotbeds of conflict and a steady rise in the level of tension  the proliferation of armed conflicts and the ascending influence of power concepts cherished by colonial forces. We have also witnessed a colonialist imperialist assault  led by the United States  against the sovereignty and independence of nations. The policy of muscle- flexing  fostered by American imperialism  particularly under the present Administration  has become more firmly established and its scope has been broadened to include the various regions of the globe. It is aimed at the security and sovereignty of States and peoples that reject submission to pressure and intimidation as practised by American imperialism in order to achieve its ambitions centred on domination and hegemony in the world and on plundering its wealth. An example of the sufferings resulting from the terrorism of American policy is found in Central America  where the friendly people of Nicaragua and their revolutionary leadership are being exposed to threats and aggression from the United States.150.	The Governments and peoples of Grenada and Cuba also face a similarly hostile policy from the United States. In addition  the United States Administration has set itself up as a guardian of the rights and the political  economic and social options of this region and  through armed force and immoral conspiracies  seeks to prevent the people of El Salvador from eradicating despotic and fascist rule and establishing a free democratic regime. It is also by means of terrorism and force that the United States Administration enables client regimes to seize power  irrespective of opposition from their peoples. The ruling regimes of Chile  El Salvador and Guatemala are clear instances of this.151.	My country  the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  has for its part suffered from American threats and intimidation in the form of direct aggression  economic pressure  acts of provocation and threats by the Sixth Fleet off the Libyan coast and near the Gulf of Sidra  repeated infringement of Libyan air space by military aircraft  spying by AWACS aircraft and military manoeuvres near our frontiers. Such acts are regarded not only as a violation of the territorial sovereignty of Libya and a threat to the security of the Libyan people  but also as a threat to the security of the States of the Mediterranean and Africa and a violation of the international principles and laws which prohibit the use of force in international relations. My country has declared it will prevent any foreign Power from violating its territorial air space and waters in the Gulf of Sidra  and explicit orders have been given to our naval and air forces to shoot down any target breaching the sanctity of our territorial waters and skies.152.	This adventurist policy of the United States Administration against the Libyan people and other nations has been condemned by all countries in many international forums and has led to complications in the international situation and the exacerbation of tensions endangering international peace and security.153.	The tactics of confrontation; the threats of aggression and the economic pressure applied by American imperialism and its colonialist and racist allies will not succeed in intimidating the peoples and will not stifle their legitimate aspirations to freedom  independence  the right to self-determination and a secure  peaceful existence.154.	The international community and the United Nations in particular bear a direct responsibility for curbing the United States Administration and denouncing the power-hungry policies it follows in terrorizing nations. My country  the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  calls upon all countries  particularly those under the yoke of the terrorism of the United States policies  such as Nicaragua and Iran  to take every possible practical step to expose the record of American terrorism and to suggest the appropriate means to counter it. To this end  we propose the following.155.	First  public symposiums and trials should be held to shed light on the terrorism of American policies  which contradict its frequently proclaimed desire to protect the free world. Thus it is pursuing a similar course to that which led to its involvement in the Viet Nam war.156.	Secondly  the American public should be addressed directly to reveal the reality of United States political terrorism and its hostile attitude to peoples and their choices.157.	Thirdly  efforts should be made within the framework of the United Nations to take measures strong enough to counter the hostile policies fostered by the United States Administration and also to deal with the tension and instability that result from those policies in many countries of the world.158.	My country  as a world centre for combating imperialism  Zionism and racism  is prepared to consult with the countries that suffer from American recklessness for the purpose of forming a common policy for countering the aggression and power politics.159.	As a result of overt imperialistic interventions  the situation in the Arab world is explosive  endangering the region and threatening its international peace and security. Today we are witnessing flagrant intervention by American troops in Lebanon  while United States military manoeuvres abound in several Arab countries. This endangers the security and safety not only of those countries but of neighbouring countries as well. This intervention serves the goal of fostering American domination and hegemony and expanding its spheres of influence. Meanwhile  the Zionist entity in occupied Palestine persists in defying the international community and all international laws and norms. In addition to occupying Palestine  it continues to annex more territory in order to make a reality of the Zionist dream of establishing a Zionist State stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates.160.	Continued Israeli aggression in Arab territories and the unceasing racist practices  ranging from mass slaughter  torture and unlawful seizure of property to disregarding the resolutions of the Security Council  the General Assembly and regional and international organizations  make it imperative for the international community to reconsider its stance towards the Zionist entity and to embark upon effective measures to ensure the reimposition of legitimacy and the laws that have been ignored. Once again  we emphasize the necessity of adopting the following measures.161.	First  the Zionist entity must be expelled from the General Assembly because of the Zionist defiance of its resolutions and pursuant to the resolution adopted during the Assembly's ninth emergency special session  and in view of the fact that it is not a peace-loving Member and has not fulfilled the obligations to which it is committed by the Charter.162.	Secondly  an economic  military and political boycott must be imposed on this entity  which has surpassed all limits in flouting international resolutions and has never observed any of the norms of international conduct or respected any human rights.163.	Thirdly  the military and financial assistance being extended to the Zionist entity  particularly by the United States  and which is being used in the invasion of other countries  in murdering the innocent and in carrying out massacres such as occurred in Lebanon must be stopped.164.	Last year we cautioned the world that the so-called peace initiativesâwhich are in fact aimed at capitulation âwould not succeed if they did not ensure recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Today  we reiterate that these rights are clear; they are acknowledged by the international community in every forum. They are unequivocally defined as the restoration to the Palestinian people of its homeland and the exercise of the right to self-determination and to establish an independent State on the soil of Palestine  where Moslems and Christians can coexist under the leadership of the PLO.164. The situation in Lebanon has deteriorated recently as a result of increased flagrant American intervention and the fact that the United States and French troops are siding with one of the warring factions. We find that the multinational force dispatched under the pretext of maintaining peace has itself threatened peace and security  having turned the Lebanese conflict from a sectarian and local conflict into an international one  wherein the multinational force  while posing as a defender  seeks to set one Lebanese group against another in an imperialist crusade.163. Those observing the role of the multinational force  especially the role of the Americans  are wondering why the fire of United States warships and artillery has been directed only against the Druse and the Shiites. Is that pure coincidence or is it because they are Moslems? We are also wondering why  if it is the task of the United States troops to halt the fighting and silence the guns  they have not directed a single shot at the Phalangist troops. Is that pure coincidence or because they are Christians? Such acts of bigotry are reminiscent of scenes from the medieval Crusades and prompt us to warn that their continuation would throw the world into further conflicts and formations of blocs  thereby heightening the current tension and pushing the world closer toward confrontation.166.	The objectives of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon were evident from the very beginning  and so also were the American assistance and support for this onslaught. This is because the United States has always sought to find in the Arab region solutions which suited itself  after the pattern of the Camp David agreements. Thus  when no other Arab country would participate in those agreements  the United States Administration induced Israel to invade Lebanon  considering that to be the weakest link in the Arab resistance chain.. The obvious goal of the Israeli invasion was to force Lebanon to sign a peace treaty and create a ruling regime willing to acquiesce  co-operate with Israel  expel Palestinians from Lebanon  strip the Lebanese national force of its arms and eventually besiege Syria to impose on it political solutions incompatible with its fundamental convictions.167.	The opposition of Syria and the Lebanese national forces to the Israeli treaty has abrogated it in terms of applicability  and the United States therefore seeks to impose it by force through its troops  military aircraft and warships.168.	Peace will not prevail in Lebanon through United States shelling and bombardment from the air and the sea  nor through threatening the Lebanese people by deploying the biggest war vessels off the Lebanese shores. We are requested to seek the withdrawal of United States troops and the other multinational contingents in Lebanon  in order to confine the conflict to its local and internal nature and enable the disputing Lebanese parties to embark on a dialogue and achieve national reconciliation.169.	The situation in Africa presents another example of the politics of intimidation and threat of the United States Administration and some other colonialist Powers in suppressing the will of small nations.170.	In Africa and along the southern borders of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  the fraternal people of Chad  under the leadership of the Transitional National Union Government formed pursuant to the Lagos Accord of 18 August 1979/ are still striving to quell the mutiny and restore the usurped authority to its legitimate Government comprising all Chadian factions. The people ofChad almost realized their aims and the civil war would have ended during the last two months had it not been for the hysterical intervention of the colonialist powers which sent thousands of their soldiers and hundreds of mercenaries into Chad  supported by warplanes and a variety of weapons to protect the rebel  Hissein Habre  after he ran out of both troops and popular backing.171.	The French and American intervention in Chad under the pretext of maintaining peace has only produced further deterioration in the situation there and the internationalization of the civil war. This was due to the fact that the American intervention was not meant for peace. That intervention in Chad corresponds with the United States' declared policy of creating new hotbeds of tension as well as gaining new spheres of influence  even at the expense of its allies  not to mention its disregard for the will of the Chadian people themselves.172.	For the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  Chad is a neighbouring country and the security of the two countries is interlinked. This African nation cannot be divided ethnically and geographically into north and south as some envisage.173.	In ethnic  geographic and religious terms  Chad is a multiracial and multireligious country where ""Al- Qor'aan"" tribes dwell in the north  Arab tribes in the east and a variety of African and Arab tribes in the centre  in addition to Negro tribes in the south. The Islamic faith is embraced by the majority  and each area has its own inherited leadership. Mr. Hissein Habre never had any political or social standing among those groups  a fact that caused his rebellion against reconciliation agreements in Lagos and his recourse to outside powers to eradicate legitimacy in the country.174.	No solution in Chad is feasible unless it is predicated on peace and corresponds to Chad's ethnic  tribal and religious map. In the light of this assessment of the Chadian reality  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is willing to contribute constructively to the peace efforts sponsored by the OAU and its current Chairman  President Mengistu Haile Mariam.175.	In Namibia  the racist minority regime of South Africa continues to cling to its illegitimate administration of the Territory  to suppress the blacks and plunder the riches of the Territory in collaboration with the transnational corporations of the Western countries. All this happens in clear defiance of all relevant resolutions  particularly those adopted by the United Nations and several international bodies. The racist regime  with the assistance of Western countries  keeps on manoeuvring to block Namibia's independence and to undermine Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Linking Namibian independence to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola is simply another indication of the collusion of the United States and some Western countries with the racist regime to prevent the United Nations from achieving true independence for Namibia and reflects an attempt to grant the Territory a self-styled independence consistent with Western designs. Libya considers this an instance of interference in the internal affairs of Angola.176.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya asserts its unconditional support for SWAPO as the only legitimate representative of the Namibian people in its struggle to attain independence and the right to self-determination. We urge the Security Council to take effective measures in order to enforce its resolutions and achieve Namibian independence  if necessary by imposing comprehensive economic sanctions on the racist regime to force the termination of its unlawful administration of Namibia and to make it possible for the Namibian people freely to decide on its future. 177.	In southern Africa  the minority racist regime of Pretoria continues to adhere to its apartheid policy which is considered by this Organization to be a crime against mankind. This regime has intensified its campaign of executions  crackdowns and arrests against national leaders and has adopted a new strategy of aggression against neighbouring African countries. In addition to its continued occupation of Namibia and part of Angolan territory  the racist regime lately has been involved in setting up gangs of saboteurs and equipping them with arms and various means to conduct subversive and destabilizing operations inside those countries  particularly Angola  Mozambique and Lesotho. It is obvious that all these acts of terrorism are being carried out with the political  economic and military backing of colonialist countries  especially the United States.178.	The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya declares its solidarity with and support for Angola  Mozambique  Lesotho and all other front-line States in their steadfast resistance to the racist regime in South Africa. It also reaffirms its backing of liberation movements in South Africa struggling to bring about a majority rule and to eradicate the abhorrent apartheid regime.179.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya played its role to the full in the Western Sahara until it was liberated from Spanish colonialism which had plagued it for hundreds of years. It endeavoured with the African countries within the framework of the OAU to address this issue with a view to enabling the Saharan people to exercise its right to self-determination in conformity with the resolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth sessions of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held in 1981 and 1983. These efforts contributed to the creation of the positive atmosphere necessary for a durable and just settlement of this problem  for eliminating causes of tension in the region and keeping it free from international disputes.180.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya devotes special attention to the question of security in the Mediterranean  which has become one of the most dangerous centres of tension threatening international peace and security. This situation is a result of the increasing presence of naval fleets and the expansion of the network of foreign military basesâespecially the fleet and bases of the United States âand the signing of the strategic co-operation agreement between the Zionist entity and the United States. Those are the main factors of instability in the Mediterranean region posing a direct threat to the security and sovereignty of the countries of the region. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya wishes to see the Mediterranean a lake of peace and co-operation  free of foreign armadas  bases and hotbeds of tension.181.	The failure to solve the question of Cyprus has had a negative impact on the security of the Mediterranean region and has compounded the already intricate problems afflicting the region.182.	My country hopes the Turkish and Greek communities will find a just solution to this issue through direct negotiation between them  a solution that can ensure the independence  neutrality and territorial integrity of Cyprus.183.	On the basis of its profound conviction that the question of international peace is an indivisible whole  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya supports the just demands of the countries of the Indian Ocean region that their region be made a zone of peace  free of foreign bases and fleets.184.	My country also supports the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people to the peaceful reunification of their land and calls for the creation of the appropriate conditions to that end  such as non-intervention in internal affairs and the withdrawal of American troops from the southern part of Korean territory.185.	Disarmament and the strengthening of international security are among the important questions facing the world today. Yet  despite long years of negotiations within the framework of the United Nations and other international forums  no perceptible progress has been achieved in the disarmament talks  and none of the disarmament measures set out in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly âthe first special session devoted to disarmamentâhas been implemented. This failure is the result of the lack of political will among the big Powers  which continue their arms race  especially at the nuclear level  and substantially increase their military expenditure on the manufacturing of sophisticated and highly destructive weapons and on the deployment of new types of such weapons in various regions of the world. As a result  an explosive international situation has arisen  increasing dependence on power  military pressure and intervention against independent countries as well as the sense of insecurity among all nations  particularly the developing one;.186.	The negative impact of the arms race goes beyond threats to international peace and security; it has economic and social effects. We find that while the world is spending more than $600 billion annually on armaments  hundreds of millions of human beings in the world are suffering from disease  illiteracy and unemployment. In this respect  the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya notes with satisfaction the Soviet Union's initiatives in favour of denuclearization and the dismantling of the medium-range missiles in Europe  for those initiatives seek to save mankind from the scourge of war and to rescue the world from destruction.187.	One of the causes of the deterioration in the international situation is the erosion of the effectiveness of the United Nations and its inability to discharge its responsibilities. We can even say that its will has been paralysed because of the domination of the veto power in the main organ responsible for the maintenance of peace and security  the Security Council. The abuse of this veto power by some of the permanent members has turned the Council into a forum serving the security of those States at the expense of the security of other nations. Moreover  the availability of the veto power is in contradiction with the simplest rules of democracy  since the will of the entire membership of the Security Council is totally subservient to that of the five permanent members of that body.188.	Keenly interested in buttressing the role of the Organization and promoting its efficiency  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has for the past five years been proposing that the veto power be abrogated or amended or that the General Assembly be given greater power. Those proposals  however  have been rejected by most of the big Powers  which have applied pressure on small countries to prevent the adoption of any measures that could lead to achieving equal sovereignty for all Member States.189.	The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will continue to press this matter as long as the veto power continues to be used against the struggle of the peoples and as an instrument for consecrating despotism and monopoly and for overriding the opinion of the majority. Abrogating the veto power or amending it so as to enable all the States members of the Security Council to exercise it would strengthen the United Nations and restore the developing nations' confidence in it. 190.	While I am speaking of promoting the role of the United Nations  I cannot fail to point out that the Organization's very existence is threatened by the harassment that the delegations of its Member States are facing  in outright violation of the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations These violations prevent some countries from participating effectively in the activities of the Organization. The host country must shoulder its responsibilities fully in this regard and must abide by the provisions of the Headquarters Agreement; otherwise  one day the Member States will be forced to request the transfer of the Headquarters of the United Nations to another place.191.	Another question of direct concern to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is the problem of the mines and explosives planted on Libyan territory during the Second World War. We have been suffering ever since the deadly economic  social and environmental consequences of this. Hundreds of innocent people have become victims of these mines  not to speak of the thousands disabled by them. But  in addition  we face other problems in implementing development plans  such as delays in completing projects and a consequent rise in their costs.192.	The question of mines and other remnants of war and the colonial Powers' liability and obligation to compensate the countries affected adds a new principle in international affairs  under which colonialism and the introduction of weapons of destruction must be regarded as an act of aggression and a crime subject to punishment. The liability must be borne by the country perpetrating the crime and the material price for the colonialism and the suppression of the will of the peoples must be paid.193.	My country urges the United Nations to take effective measures to determine the damages we have sustained and to assess the compensation  in accordance with the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly.194.	The world economic situation has deteriorated further  and the efforts to give momentum to the North- South dialogue have failed because of the dominating influence that the spirit of egotism and self-interest has had on the attitudes of industrialized States  particularly the United States.195.	Economic co-operation among developing countries has become more important in the economic conditions of the world in general and the developing countries in particular  and in the light of the negative attitudes of the developed countries towards their co-operation with the developing countries. This co-operation has become significant in both strategic and economic terms  and the developing countries have to seek to promote economic co-operation  especially now that a solid basis for it has been established at the High Level Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries  held at Caracas from 13 to 19 May 1981  and at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Governments of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983.

"82",4155,"LKA",38,1983,"ï»¿  I extend to Mr. Illueca the felicitations and good wishes of Sri Lanka on his election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. It has been my personal pleasure to have known him. His achievements  first as representative of Panama to the United Nations  then as Foreign Minister and now as his country's Vice-President  leave no doubt that this difficult session is in very good hands. The thanks of my delegation are also due to Mr. Hollai of Hungary for the admirable manner in which he conducted the thirty-seventh session as its President. I should also like to associate my delegation with those who have welcomed the State of Saint Christopher and Nevis into the United Nations. When the United Nations was first established over three decades ago the world was recovering from the ravages of the Second World War. There was then an essential unity of purpose in the determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. While the world has  since then  been spared the horrors of another universal war  conflicts nevertheless rage in various parts of the world  and the threat of a global conflagration has never been too distant. In fact  the nuclear aspect has now added a terrifying new dimension to every threat or potential threat to international peace and security. The need for massive economic regeneration was a prime imperative in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. Three decades later strategies for global economic recovery still languish  unfulfilled  on our agendas and the world continues to remain remote from real economic prosperity. Unfettered national interest  which had been pushed to its arrogant extreme during the Second World War  is today being pursued in a multitude of forms and constitutes a major obstacle in many areas of international co-operation and the search for peaceful solutions. The Charter of the United Nations enshrines at once mankind's noblest collective aspirations and the limits to which the national options of Member States need to be subject if we are to be sensitive to wider concerns. Member States  however powerful or sovereign they may be  cannot be permitted selfishly to pursue narrow sectarian interests if this infringes on the sovereignty and concerns of other nations or runs counter to obligations assumed under the Charter. The Charter must remain the basic framework within which Member States must conduct their relations with other States and with the international community as a whole. The apartheid regime of South Africa continues to cling to its pernicious privileges in cynical contempt of the Charter and all it embodies. The regime's ruthless suppression of the freedom struggle of the majority population has frequently swollen into desperate wars of aggression conducted with impunity against the independent front-line African States of Angola  Botswana  Mozambique  the United Republic of Tanzania  Zambia and Zimbabwe. The regime continues to control neighbouring Namibia  despite decisions of the International Court of Justice and the United Nations which have clearly declared such control to be illegal. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) gave promise of a unique exercise in co-operation involving the peoples of Namibia  the United Nations and even the South African regime  which had sought to force its own unilateral and illegal solution to the Namibian question. However  resolution 435 (1978) and the collective enterprise spelt out in it remain unimplemented  and the Secretary-General's recent visit to South Africa  I am sorry to say  does not offer much new hope. In the Middle East ironies abound. Israel  itself a creature of United Nations fiat  dishonors the Charter of the very Organization which gave it birth. Claiming it is in a state of siege  Israel has arrogated unto itself the right for its armed forces not only to strike deep into the territory of independent Arab States like Syria  Lebanon and Jordan  but also in effect to colonize large areas of these countries. The inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people have been accepted by virtually all Members of the United Nations  and a series of peace plans has accordingly been put forward with a view to reaching some form of negotiated settlement on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the principles of the Charter. The Arab peace plan adopted at Fez  at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference ' as well as the Programme of Action of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held last month at Geneva  provide blueprints that would guarantee the peace and security of all States in the region  including the Palestinian State. Without the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian and other occupied Arab territories  peace will remain a stranger to that region  the Middle East. The continued presence of other foreign forces in the northern section of the Republic of Cyprus has been  for that troubled State  the major obstacle to the full exercise of its independence and the preservation of its territorial integrity. Sri Lanka does not in any way condone the fragmentation of a unitary non-aligned State which has been recognized by the United Nations. We call once more for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Cyprus. We support all efforts  particularly those of the Secretary-General and the contact group of non-aligned countries on Cyprus  to find a lasting solution to the question of Cyprus. Sri Lanka's position on Cyprus was stated in the Assembly in November 1978  during the thirty-third session: ""... the Government of Sri Lanka does not subscribe to the principle that any State is justified in using its armed forces  however justifiable it may itself believe that to be  in the settlement of international disputes. My delegation considers it utterly deplorable for any State to use its armed forces to interfere in the internal affairs of any neighbouring State  however much compassion and feeling there may be for a fellow ethnic or communal group in that neighbouring State. Such action cannot be justified in any circumstances.""  The internal upheavals in two fellow Asian States  both members of the Movement of Non-Aligned CountriesâAfghanistan and Kampucheaâhave not been completely eased by the introduction of foreign forces. Although the two questions are not identical  Sri Lanka calls for a comprehensive political solution to these two questions on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign forces  strict respect for non-interference in the internal affairs of the two countries and satisfactory guarantees to ensure full respect for their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and freedom from foreign interference. In the region of the Indian Ocean  it was the determination of the peoples of the littoral and hinterland States to preserve their independence and to resolve their problems in conditions of peace and tranquility which led in 1971 to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. The States of the region have called for the co-operation of the great Powers in establishing the peace zone  and we have endeavored within the framework of the Committee on the Indian Ocean to finalize all preparations for convening the Conference on the Indian Ocean early next year at Colombo. This Conference would bring together the Indian Ocean States  the great Powers and other States that are major maritime users of the ocean. We do not expect the establishment of a peace zone overnight; but the Conference at Colombo would be a first step in a bold venture in international co-operation which would benefit not only the States of the region but also the great Powers and  indeed  the world at large. The regional States have achieved a major degree of agreement on seven principles for the implementation of the peace zone. These include arrangements for the non-use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes among regional States. We were ushered to the threshold of a new era of international co-operation in ocean development with the conclusion  a year ago  of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The task before us now is to translate the concepts of that multilateral framework into reality through appropriate programmes for implementation. To many developing countries like my own  the full benefits of the Convention on the Law of the Sea can be reaped only if we are able to develop capabilities for exploiting the oceans and their unbounded resources. This can be done through the advancement of marine affairs capabilities in developing countries  particularly in the field of marine science and technology. Here  too  a co-operative endeavor within the United Nations system could provide a response to those needs through a central co-ordination of information  advice  assistance and services at the global and regional  as well as national  levels. From the deep frontiers of the oceans  man has turned his gaze to the outer reaches of space. We hope that this last frontier of mankind will be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and for the common benefit of all mankind. Sri Lanka supports all initiatives to prevent the militarization of outer space and the extension of the arms race to its reaches. The vast continent of Antarctica has great economic potential and should not become the scene or object of international discord. This area should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes  in the interests of all mankind. Sri Lanka supports the initiative of Malaysia and others to have the General Assembly undertake a comprehensive study on Antarctica with a view to widening international co-operation in the area. It is our hope also that the many initiatives being taken to bring an end to the tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq will bear fruit. For Sri Lanka  which has excellent relations with both these countries  the continuation of the conflict is a matter of very great concern  and we hope that the international community will be able to contribute in some way towards peace between these two countries. The mounting tension in the region of Central America causes us concern. Initiatives for a peaceful settlement by the Contadora Group deserve our every encouragement. I seek your indulgence to make a reference to the recent events in my country which have been publicized in the media and have received the attention of the international community. Let me at the outset say what has been widely acknowledged even by our critics  namely  that Sri Lanka is a parliamentary democracy with over half a century of universal adult franchise  with a multiparty system and with every citizen having his individual and constitutional rights guaranteed and made justifiable in the Constitution. When we speak of the Tamil question in Sri Lanka  a distinction must also be made between the Sri Lanka Tamils who have settled in the north and the relatively more recent Tamil immigrants from India  who were brought to Sri Lanka by the former colonial administration to work on tea and rubber plantations. After independence  the status of that group was resolved through a series of consultations which led to an agreement with our neighbor  India  under which a formula was accepted by which my country would abstain a number of them while a certain number of others were to be repatriated to India. While we do not wish to make pronouncements on the problem of immigrant labor elsewhere  we believe that the arrangement we have reached for absorbing such large numbers from a non-indigenous community into the mainstream of the country's national life has no comparable precedent. As far as language goes  the two main minorities in Sri Lankaâthe Tamils and the Muslimsâboth speak the Tamil language. The identity of the minority communities does not appear merely symbolically on the national flag of Sri Lanka; the Tamil language has deceived a recognition not seen or heard or experienced by Tamil-speaking communities settled in any other country. The Tamil language and the Sinhala language of the Sinhalese majority that constitutes 74 per cent of the population are both national languages. The Tamil language appears on Sri Lanka's stamps  on its currency and in all official publications. The Moslem community and the substantial section of the Tamil people residing in the northwest  the east  the northeast and the south of the country are  as demonstrated in repeated elections  vehemently opposed to separatism or a division of the country. However  alongside the advocacy of separation by the Tamil United Liberation Front  a terrorist group pursuing the same aims employs violenceâincluding arson and damage to public property  armed robbery of Government and private financial institutions and murder of political personalities opposed to its views and of Government law-enforcement officers from the police and the armed servicesâfor the purpose of establishing a separate State. It was against this violent background that on 23 July this same terrorist group ambushed and killed 13 army personnel on patrol and provoked the communal violence that followed during that week. That week's violence  which we see as an aberration in our civil and political life  we condemn without reservation. Certain sections of the foreign media made the unfounded allegation that the Government itself had turned a blind eye or had even condoned this violence. The fact is that during the first three days a section of the armed services was reluctant to open fire and to enforce law and order against the rioters and looters  who claimed that they were avenging the deaths of the 13 men of the armed services. Governments in other parts of the world which have undergone similar experiences know only too well the delicate nature of such situations. In such an environment  when the administration and law-enforcement machinery hangs by a flimsy thread  one wrong move could invite only greater chaos. That President Jayewardene was able to bring such a difficult and delicate situation under control within a week has been barely acknowledged. The media's desire for sensation in similar situations is not unknown  but certain non-governmental organizations  basing themselves on accounts  have sought to put Sri Lanka on trial and have depicted this unfortunate ethnic conflict as one between the Government and the Tamil people. A Government which has taken into custody over 5 000 people suspected of rioting  looting and breaking the law could hardly be accused of condoning or of being a party to this violence. No Government in independent Sri Lanka has tried harder to resolve this problem by accommodating the claims of the minority Tamil community. On the one hand  the Government has been severely criticized by the majority Sinhalese community for the efforts and concessions it has made. On the other hand  the representatives of the Tamil minority proclaim to the outside world that their civil and human rights have been violated  and therefore their answer is a separate State. Perhaps this dissatisfaction of both the majority and the minority communities is in itself evidence that the Government has been both balanced and impartial in its handling of this difficult question. I have taken much time in this narration of the background and events that have brought us to this sorry pass. But 1 cannot leave this forum without stating unreservedly that for the Government and people of Sri Lanka âand among these people I include the overwhelming number of the minorities in our populationâthe independence  territorial integrity  sovereignty and unity of Sri Lanka are not negotiable. In short  under no circumstances can we or will we accept the division of the country. It was in reaffirmation of this that the Parliament of Sri Lanka adopted a Constitutional amendment which requires of its citizens allegiance to a unitary State. I shall conclude these remarks with the assurance that the Government of Sri Lanka will continue without reservations its efforts to restore communal harmony and to ensure for all its people the rights and guarantees which have been clearly set out in our Constitution. The Charter of the United Nations is the basic framework under which all nations must function. The principles embodied in the Charter are relevant not only to the conduct of inter-State relations but also have a vital bearing on the internal affairs of States as well. The goals to which an individual Government dedicates itself and the manner in which it seeks to ensure for its people conditions conducive to the development of their collective national identity take place within the overall context of international relations. The international environment must therefore be one which provides adequate peace and security so that Governments may be unhindered in articulating the aspirations of their peoples. Therefore a duty lies on each of us to strive for the creation and preservation of such an environment. The Charter is the only international instrument which provides a comprehensive blueprint for the creation of such international conditions. We must therefore rededicate ourselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter  individually as well as collectively."
"83",4198,"LSO",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 It is with great pleasure that I bring to the Assembly the greetings of my head of State  King Moshoeshoe II  and of my Prime Minister  Mr. Leabua Jonathan.2.	Permit me  Sir  to congratulate you on your well- deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your well-known qualities and experience as an illustrious and dedicated diplomat certainly augur well for the Assembly. We are more than confident that you will guide its deliberations to a successful and fruitful conclusion  because your country is not only a prominent member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries but also has an illustrious record on such issues as the eradication of colonialism  racism  racial discrimination and	matters which are of paramount importance to us.3.	We also congratulate the other officers of the Assembly on their unanimous election. To you  Sir  and to all of them I pledge my delegation's full co-operation.4.	I also take this opportunity to express our satisfaction with the excellent manner in which the President of the thirty-seventh session and his officers concluded the work of that session.I should like to convey my delegation's commendation of the Secretary-General and his championship not only of the rights of the smaller and weaker Members of the Organization but also of the independence of those few parts of the globe that still labour under the yoke of colonialism. To us  his office is the pivotal point of the entire work of the United Nations  and we hope and believe that with him the responsibilities of that office are in very good hands.6.	In accordance with our firm belief in the Organization's universality  we were more than delighted to be among the sponsors of the resolution admitting Saint Christopher and Nevis to membership. We are doubly gratified because that nation is a fellow member of the Commonwealth. This event is a credit to the British Government and to the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. We view it with mixed feelings  because we are once again reminded of those countries and peoples that are still denied their rightful place in forums such as this one. In our view  the independence of Namibia is now overdue.7.	On the economic front  we note that the Assembly meets at a time when prospects for prosperity are at their bleakest. The economies of more than two thirds of the Organization's Members are being hit by the worst recession since the Second World War  and all of those countries are pinning their last hopes on the Assembly. It is imperative  therefore  that the Assembly live up to those expectations.8.	When the heads of State or Government of the non- aligned countries pledged their commitment to the North- South dialogue at their sixth conference  at Havana in 1979  it was because they had recognized its significance in their area  especially in view of the prevailing world economic crisis. The situation facing these countries can be tackled only through a collective global approach. It is their belief and ours that these problems call for a genuine dialogue and a willingness to recognize and accept not only the gravity but also the urgency of the matter.9.	However  we regret to note that despite all the efforts made by the developing countries during the eleventh special session  in 1980  and during subsequent General Assembly sessions  no agreement has yet been reached regarding the agenda  procedure and time-frame for these global negotiations. In the meantime  the world economy has been experiencing the most critical decline since the great depression. It may be noted that in some developed countries of the North there have been signs of recovery. But the rigidity in some of these countries' financial policies resulted  for instance  in the failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983. These developments leave no room for optimism.10.	It is three years now since the new International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade was adopted  and its overall review and appraisal is due in 1984  as provided for in General Assembly resolution 35/56. The indications are  however  that there is very little movement  if any at all  towards achieving the objectives of the Strategy. The past three years have seen a sharp decline in the rate of growth of world production  which reached in 1982 its lowest figure in three decades. In 1981 world trade was stagnant for the first time since the Second World War  and it declined by 6 per cent in real value in 1982. The responsibility for this unfortunate state of affairs should be attributed to a fall in commodity prices by 16 per cent between 1981 and 1982. Protectionism persisted and grew stronger  and as a result there was a decline in exports and intense pressure on the balance of payments position of the developing countries.11.	Signs of recovery have recently emerged in some developed countries  but they appear tentative and far from reaching developing countries. Debt servicing among the developing countries continues to be widespread and unmanageable  while interest rates have remained at unprecedented levels since 1980. The aid performance of donor countries is still one half of that called for in the Strategy  and the volume of contributions to the multilateral programmes has actually declined. Official development assistance receipts by the least developed countries by no means constitute the substantial increase needed to enable them to double their national income during the decade  as envisaged. The message is therefore that we cannot look forward to the review and appraisal of the Strategy with any encouragement. It is also evident that the General Assembly should agree on a continuing annual review and monitoring of the Strategy until such time as an improvement in the world economy can be widely recognized.12.	It is regretted that the ministerial meeting of the Contracting Parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade held from 24 to 29 November 1982 at Geneva failed to utilize its chance to turn the tide against protectionism. It was also unfortunate that the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development last June failed to agree on any steps aimed at reducing barriers to free trade as a starting point in an economic dialogue on fostering the growth of output and employment without provoking inflation and/or balance- of-payments problems. Finally  it was disappointing that that session failed to come up with a resolution on the need for a conference on money and finance with a view to restructuring the Bretton Woods system  despite forceful appeals from the third world and some industrialized countries. In the circumstances  it remains the responsibility of the General Assembly to address itself fully to all these questions  and it should do so with a commitment to success.13.	In this regard  the General Assembly should seriously consider the call of the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries at their seventh conference  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983  urgently to convene an international conference on money and finance for development. This conference should aim at meeting effectively the development and other financial requirements of international economies  particularly those of the developing countries. It should also examine any necessary growth-oriented structural adjustments. There was a similar call to pursue monetary and financial reforms capable of arresting the continuation of the economic crisis by some leaders of industrialized countries in other forums earlier this year. This indicates that there is some consensus and only details need to be worked out.14.	It is  however  our belief that the idea of a world development fund should be kept alive. This idea calls for a move towards greater equality and partnership between North and South in financial institutions; universal membership  including full representation of Eastern European countries; new lending policies; export credit's; commodity financing and the channelling of new resources raised on an international basisâin other words  the restructuring of the Bretton Woods system should incorporate this idea.15.	On the political front  we note with much trepidation the multiplicity of problems facing the world today  ranging from the Middle East to Central America to southern Africa. The worsening situation in Lebanon  a country torn apart by forces stronger than itself  most of them external  can only force us to pray that enough is enough. We in Lesotho  surrounded as we are by a similarly threatening external factor  have reason to understand in the fullest sense the tribulations of the people of Lebanon.16.	The world conscience continues to be affronted by the impasse on the Palestinian question. Lesotho has in the past made its position very clear  that  without prejudice to anybody's interests  the Palestinians have a right to their land  identity and sovereignty. We have always urged that the Middle East issue must be viewed in the context of Security Council resolutions. In Central America  Lesotho supports the efforts of the Contadora Group.17.	Within the context of the Organization of African Unity [OA U]  we are eagerly looking forward to the OAU machinery for resolving the problems of Chad and Western Sahara. Lesotho enthusiastically supports any practical measures that may contribute to the speedy solution of those problems.18.	South Africa's policy of destabilization manifests itself in diverse ways  encompassing and affecting all the independent States in southern Africa. Its main victims include the entire membership of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference and the frontline States. Africans have come to regard the major cause of this scenario as what they term  the constructive engagement syndrome . We all know that the present United States Administration meant well in its initiation of this policy. What is important to us in Africa is not the good intentions of Washington but how its good intentions are being taken advantage of by Pretoria. Indeed  the latter interprets this United States policy as a carte balance allowing it militarily to disregard internationally accepted civilized norms in relationships with its neighbours for the sacrosanctity of its strategic position and mineral wealth as it is supposedly seen by Washington.19.	Namibian independence has yet to materialize. What is the problem? Why is Namibian independence being indexed to the unrelated issue of Cuban withdrawal? We condemn in the strongest terms these delaying tactics  which can only result in the intensification of the armed struggle and  with it  continued loss of life on both sides. We should like to repeat that we find totally unacceptable attempts to establish linkages between Namibia's independence and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. We know that since 1975 the People's Republic of Angola has been subjected to constant military incursions by South African troops which are now occupying southern Angola. South Africa's main motive seems to be the promotion of the puppet  Savimbi  to the status of a serious factor in Angola.20.	If it is the intention of South Africa to use its military might to partition Angola  then the Government and people of Angola are left with no choice but to resort to the assistance of countries friendly to it. The suffering in Angola as a result of the war situation there is a matter of great concern. The Assembly may not permit any parties to this conflict to look upon the suffering of innocent citizens of Angola and the very security and survival of that country as a bargaining chip in an attempt to stall Namibia's independence.21.	It is ironic that  when the General Assembly and the Security Council have set the target of achieving the noble aim of Namibia's independence  and despite the Secretary-General's attempt to execute his mandate to implement this target within the context of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the very countries which are normally most vocal in portraying the importance of the United Nations in resolving international problems are the ones which are now blocking the vindication of the Organization's success by indexing irrelevant issues to Namibia's independence.22.	Lesotho  as an independent country  continues to look at the future with anxiety  especially as its giant neighbour continues to view it as the source of all security problems within its territory. It is now a matter of record that South Africa's own investigations have failed to show Lesotho to be a party to any action intended against the security of South Africa. Lesotho is fully aware of its national and international responsibilities  and South Africa should have no fear of insecurity because of any actions emanating from Lesotho. For example  with regard to the Pretoria bomb blast  which was followed by South Africa's imposition of a nearly total economic embargo  the South African security service itself has absolved Lesotho from allegations that it was the country from which the operations were planned.23.	Historically  Lesotho is a country of refugees  who were received in the mountain kingdom and moulded into one nation by the great Moshoeshoe I. The conflicts at the time in southern Africa which were responsible for the refugee movements have now been replaced by the actions of the present South African Government through its policy of apartheid.24.	As a consequence of the latter  Lesotho has continuously received refugees from South Africa. Our accession to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees' and the 1967 protocol is an event that conforms naturally to our basic national character  but  because of our geopolitical situation  we have always made it a condition of asylum for all refugees that they may not use Lesotho to plan and launch attacks against their countries of origin. This is especially the case with South African refugees  who form the majority of refugees in Lesotho and whose country of origin is the closest to Lesotho geographically.25.	Lesotho does not solicit these refugees  but we are fully aware that the tide will continue as long as apartheid remains the official policy in South Africa. Recently Lesotho has witnessed restrictions on its common borders with South Africa  which have affected the movement of people and goods; there have been incursions into Lesotho's territory by armed bandits who come from South Africa and have unrestricted access to its territory whenever they are forced to retreat. These bandits  when caught  testify readily to the fact that they are trained in South Africa and are armed and given logistic preparation by white South African security officers. Because of South Africa's intermittent embargo on the transit of essential security equipment  the internal security and maintenance of law and order of Lesotho become heavily compromised. The significance of this fact is that cross- border incursions are intensified simultaneously with the holding back of the arms.26.	We have appealed to the Secretary-General and through him to the Member States of the Organization  especially those which have contacts with South Africa  to persuade South Africa to desist from its punitive measures against Lesotho. Lesotho genuinely wants a return to normalization of relations with its neighbour but should not  in the process  be forced to abandon its obligations under international conventions with regard to the welfare of those genuinely seeking political asylum. South Africa is demanding  as a condition for normalization of relations between the two countries  the return to it of all refugees of South African origin or their expulsion from Lesotho.27.	Lesotho finds those demands unacceptable. We repeat our appeal to the Secretary-General and to the countries that have contacts with South Africaâand there are many in this Assemblyâto ask South Africa to accept Lesotho's genuine interest in its own security  which cannot be enhanced by attacks into South Africa from its territory.28.	The expulsion of refugees from one country to another offers no permanent solution to the basic problems involved. Just as the dispersal of the Palestinians all over the Mediterranean countries has failed to bring peace to the Middle East or even to wish the problem away  to the same extent the dispersal of refugees from southern African countries will not solve the problem of South Africa  which is an internal problem fraught with dangerous consequences for all of us in southern Africa; nor will the problems of South Africa be wished away. Rather than stabilizing the situation  the dispersal of the refugees in other southern African countries will cause the entire region to be destabilized. This presents a very bleak picture.29.	Members will recall that in 1976 South Africa gave its brand of so-called independence to one of its black  homelands . Since then  another three have acceded to this dubious status. This relegation of black South Africans to just 13 per cent of South Africa's most impoverished areas that had always existed as reserves for  and sources of  cheap black labour is an ominous enough development. But it has even more ominous connotations when this  independence  is used  in the final analysis  to denationalize all South African blacks. This banishment to the remote barren part of South Africa  with which they have no connection at all except remote ethnic links  to us constitutes the bleakest and most wicked aspect of the apartheid policy.30.	Recently the white South African Parliament passed legislation for a three-chamber parliament  including the Coloureds and the Indians  once again totally excluding the black majority. This development is by its very nature unacceptable because it continues to entrench race as a factor in constitutional reform. It also retains the supremacy of the white Parliament over the other so-called parliaments. But  worst of all  now it not only makes denationalization of the black majority a matter of Acc legislation but also elevates it to the status of constitutional entrenchment. We call on all mankind to condemn these actions  which are intended to deny over 18 million people their basic birthright of citizenship of their country. South Africa must be persuaded to start an immediate dialogue with genuine leaders of Mack opinion in South Africa  as the only alternative to an intensified armed struggle.31.	To us in Lesotho the so-called constitutional dispensation provides no hope or solace  since the politically ostracized black majority will continue to struggle for its rights within South Africa. The intensification of this struggle will surely mean more refugees  more attacks in South Africa resulting in more attacks on us from South Africa  more economic and arms embargoes and  indeed  a constant threat to our very existence as a nation and a people.32.	This grave situation is also exemplified by Pretoria's rejection of the Security Council's directive in resolution 527 (1982) calling on the Republic of South Africa to pay damages to Lesotho citizens for the unwarranted killing of persons and destruction of property during the deplorable 9 December 1982 attack on Lesotho by the South African Defence Force. As I have said earlier  the contemptuous rejection of that resolutionâand this is only one of manyâis an indictment against South Africa in its pursuit of a policy of continuing to defy the Assembly  thus contributing to its general paralysis  only to turn around and accuse the Organization of impotence.33.	Despite this picture of gloom and uncertainty  my Government and the Basotho people in general have been strengthened by the manner in which the plight of the refugees in Lesotho and of the Basotho in general  and the attendant unfair pressure upon them  are being understood by the international community. The international community has been a source of strength to us during our darkest hour. The ideals for which the international community strives and for which we also strive create a bond generating the belief that collectively we are fighting for a just cause. The international community has stood with us during the crisis we are facing. We request the Members of the Organization  in the name of fairness and justice  to continue to give us moral  political and material support. For what has been done so far  whether at the bilateral level with those countries with which we have friendly relations or at the level of pressure groups or even individuals  we wish to say thank you.34.	May right always prevail over might. 	"
"84",4267,"LUX",38,1983,"ï»¿265. It is a very agreeable duty as well as a true pleasure for me to join my colleagues in congratulating the President on his election to the presidency of this thirty-eighth session of the Assembly. Convinced of his outstanding qualities as a diplomat and aware of his long experience in international affairs  I have no doubt whatever that in the weeks and months to come he will lead the work of the Assembly with authority and tact.266.	I wish also to thank Mr. Hollai  the President of the thirty-seventh session of the Assembly  for the skill and dedication with ""which he guided our debates.267.	Furthermore  I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation of the exceptional dedication  lucidity and foresight of the Secretary-General and to assure him of the sincere and constructive co-operation of the Government of Luxembourg.268.	Finally  I extend a warm welcome to the delegation of Saint Christopher and Nevis  which has just joined the Organization. 269.	The past year  like others  has been rich in events that have had an impact on the work of the Assembly. My Greek colleague  Mr. Haralambopoulos  speaking at the 7th meeting on behalf of the 10 members of the European Community  set forth the Community's position on the many problems confronting us. It goes without saying that we completely support that statement. I can therefore confine myself to dealing with some issues that seem to us particularly worthy of attention.270.	Since the thirty-seventh session we have unfortunately not succeeded in putting an end to any of the many conflicts that continue to afflict the peoples of our world. Some problems have taken a slightly more positive turn; others have stagnated; still others have clearly worsened. On the whole  it is unfortunately impossible for us to say that the world situation has developed in a positive way during the past year. East-West relations  following the deterioration during the past few years  are now in particularly difficult straits; the North-South dialogue has not evolved in any way that could be described as satisfactory; and  lastly  the economic situation of the large majority of Member States is still in a state of crisis that has left deep marks.271.	Furthermore  recent events have been marked by a particularly outrageous act: the destruction of a civilian aircraft by Soviet armed forces. That inhuman act has been severely condemned by the Government and people of Luxembourg. We expect the Soviet Union to cooperate fully in the inquiry decided upon by ICAO and pay fair compensation to the families of the victims. It ought also to participate freely in a better definition of the rules of conduct to be observed in such cases  which must in any event forbid the use of force against civilian aircraft under any pretext whatsoever.272.	The tragic event I have just mentioned concerned a Korean airliner  and I should like to take this opportunity to express the fervent desire that a dialogue may at last begin without preconditions between the two parts of Korea and that as a gesture of goodwill and as a humanitarian measure members of families divided by the 38th parallel will be permitted to be reunited and to bring their family units together again.273.	Luxembourg also supports the candidacy of the Republic of Korea  which for so long has wished to become a Member of the Organization. It will not oppose the admission of North Korea.274.	Equally vigorously  we condemn the attacks and atrocities of which the populations of Afghanistan have been victim  and we strongly deplore the fate of the countless Afghan refugees who have had to flee abroad. The fact is that the occupation of that neutral  non- aligned country by the Soviet Union goes on in spite of the many resolutions adopted by nearly all the States Members of the Organization. In the name of all the principles which form the foundation of the United Nations  we demand that the Soviet troops be withdrawn and that the Afghan people be allowed to exercise its fundamental right of self-determination.275.	Another problem  and one which has concerned us for a long time  is that of Kampuchea  which remains under the domination of Viet Nam despite repeated appeals by the United Nations for a negotiated political solution. It is time to put an end to the terrible suffering that the Kampuchean people has had to endive and to make it possible for that people to control its own destiny in a neutral  independent Kampuchea free from all foreign interference. We welcome the formation of a coalition Government as an important step in that direction.276.	There can be no doubt that the situation in Poland has not yet developed in a satisfactory way. To be sure  my Government was pleased at the lifting of martial law and at the announcement of a law of amnesty last July. But we could not but note that at the same time the Polish Government enacted other measures to strengthen the machinery of repression  such as its amendment of the Constitution and of the penal code. The formation of truly free unions is not yet allowed; dialogue between the Government and the nation's active forces is not progressing; the writers' union and several other artists' unions have been disbanded; and further arrests have occurred.277.	We solemnly call upon the authorities at last to take into account the legitimate aspirations of the Polish people and thus to make a decisive contribution to the improvement of relations between East and West.278.	To return to the general situation  I would say that while the backdrop of the world stage is rather gloomy  we should not lose sight of certain more encouraging elements. I am thinking in particular of the Madrid meeting of the States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which ended in agreement  and of the signs of economic recovery seen in certain Western economies  especially that of the United States.279.	We venture to hope that these are harbingers of more positive developments which will eventually lead to a lasting improvement in East-West relations and to economic recovery at the world level. Let us seize the opportunity to transform these encouraging elements into real possibilities for reversing certain negative trends which have taken deep root in recent years.280.	Along these lines  it is somewhat reassuring that at the Madrid meeting it was possible to arrive at agreement on a Concluding Document. It is not perfect  of course  but it makes it possible for dialogue to continue and for the spirit of Helsinki to survive. The Government of Luxembourg is pleased at this development  and it hopes that the meetings to be held after that at Madrid will lead to genuine  tangible progress  starting with the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  which will take place at Stockholm at the beginning of next year. The importance we attach to that Conference  however  will in no way detract from the great interest we have in other bilateral or multilateral negotiations now under way in the Held of disarmament and which  unfortunately  are hardly progressing at all.281.	The disappointing results of the Assembly's twelfth special session  the second devoted to disarmament  showed clearly that the beginnings of a solution and of a reversal of the trend in the arms race depend more and more on progress in the talks between the two superpowers  which have particular responsibilities in this field.282.	Obviously  a country the size of Luxembourg is in favour of disarmament at the lowest possible level  which is the only guarantee of increased international stability. Negotiations  therefore  must lead to reductions which are truly balanced and verifiable  whether they concern theatre nuclear weapons  strategic weapons or conventional forces.283.	Given the serious economic problems and imbalances facing our planet  we consider that  among other measures  everything should be done to draft an international agreement to achieve greater transparency and true comparability in the area of military budgets.284. Furthermore  the establishment of an international convention prohibiting the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons seems to us to be a priority objective. We also hope that the problem of the prevention of an arms race in outer space will be dealt with as soon as possible.285.	Members will understand  however  that the negotiations most important to us at present concern intermediate-range nuclear forces. Those negotiations must be concluded before the end of the year  and there must be a restoration of the approximate balance which even the Soviet Union itself acknowledges as having existed in Europe a few years ago.286.	The new proposals put forward here two days ago by President Reagan are a proof of the firm determination of the United States and its allies to arrive speedily at a balanced agreement.287.	We urge the Soviet Union to reverse its negative reaction and to rejoin the United States in an intensive effort to achieve as soon as possible an equitable  verifiable agreement.288.	Hat we are aware too that progress in the sphere of disarmament is in no way conceivable in a climate of tension and mistrust. Therefore  to promote the cause of detente  there is a need for a certain moderation of language on all sides.289.	I have spoken of problems related to East-West relations  and I should like to say a few words on the subject of other hotbeds of tension. We cannot conceal our impatience at the fact that the question of Cyprus is still deadlocked. We warmly thank the Secretary- General for the personal commitment he continues to show in this connection  and we should like to reiterate our firm support for him. As to the substance of the matter  we continue to support fully and completely the principles set out in General Assembly resolutions 3212 (XXIX) and 3395 (XXX).290.	As for the Middle East  it remains more than ever among the most unstable regions in the world.291.	During the past year  tragic events in Lebanon have followed one another at a terrifying pace. Until just a few days ago  that martyred country was engulfed in the horrors of war and of mindless violence. The occupation of large parts of Lebanese territory by foreign forces which  according to Governments' interests  support opposing factions could soon lead to the partition and disintegration of the Lebanese nation.292.	As a small country  Luxembourg is particularly devoted to the principle of respect for the sovereignty of States  for their territorial integrity and for their national independence. Therefore  we cannot fail to keep repeating that it is essential for all foreign occupation forces whose presence is not required by the Lebanese Government to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. Freed from foreign interference  the Lebanese people could embark on the quest for genuine national reconciliation and internal peace.293.	As for negotiations on a comprehensive peace in the region  I need hardly reiterate the principles on which we consider that a solution must be based: justice for all peoples and security for all the States of the region. My Greek colleague recalled this once again on behalf of the European Community at the 7th meeting yesterday.294.	Europe is therefore in favour of self-determination for the Palestinian people  just as it will always be at Israel's side to defend the existence and security of that country and its inhabitants. But it is inconceivable that Israel should continue its present policy in the occupied territories.295.	I should like to take this opportunity to express our compassion for the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza  who have for 16 years now lived under foreign occupation and who are not only subjected to the hardships of military rule but are also exposed to deadly attacks by private militia  whose crimes more often than not go unpunished.296.	The bloody war between Iraq and Iran  which has gone on for more than three years now  adds dangerously to the instability of that part of the world and takes a tragically high toll in terms of human life and material losses. It is highly desirable and in the interests of all that reason should prevail over fanaticism and that the resolutions adopted unanimously by the Security Council and by an overwhelming majority of the members of the Assembly  resolutions calling for an immediate cease-fire and the cessation of all military operations  should at long last be respected.297.	As regards the situation in Iran  the execution and detention of members of the Baha'i religion and the recent disbanding of all the organizations of that religious community constitute particularly flagrant violations  which we strongly condemn  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.298.	On the African continent  the question of Chad has assumed a new and tragic dimension. The intervention of the Libyan army in the territory of Chad constitutes inadmissible interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign country and therefore a clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations. In fact  the legitimacy of the Government of President Hissein Habre has once again been confirmed at the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa in June 1983. The fact that the Libyan Government questions that legitimacy in no way gives it a right to intervene by force of arms in the internal affairs of Chad. Foreign armed intervention only aggravates the conflict in that country and prevents the consolidation of the internal situation. Therefore the fighting must come to an end and negotiations must be resumed in accordance with the resolution adopted by the heads of State and Government of the OAU  inviting Chad and Libya to seek a negotiated settlement to their dispute in the context of the Mediation Committee established by the OAU. This  however  should not preclude similar efforts on the part of competent bodies of the Uni. J Nations  including the Security Council and the Secretary-General.299.	The African continent continues to be shaken by other conflicts and crises which require solution. In the south  especially  two objectives remain to be achieved: the independence of Namibia and the elimination of the racist policy of apartheid.300.	As for Namibia  our hopes have been disappointed once again. At the thirty-seventh session  from this same rostrum I expressed cautious optimism as to the chances of success in the near future of the initiatives of the contact group. Unfortunately  it has not yet been possible for those negotiations to succeed. None the less  in a report drawn up by the Secretary-General following his recent visit to that part of the world we find positive elements which give us grounds to hope that the people of Namibia may soon take control of its own destiny. Unfortunately the illegal occupation of Namibia does not constitute the only problem in that region.  The institutionalization of racism  seems nowhere near an end. That policy  aimed at maintaining the privileges of a minority  can '.n the long run have only tragic and violent consequences  which must be averted. This is why we have always condemned that flagrant injustice and will continue to demand from the South African authorities action aimed at the genuine establishment of a society based on justice and equal rights for all.301.	There can be no doubt that at the root of that situation is  above all  the injustice and inequality which the majority of the population of that region has suffered for generations. But local problems are now aggravated by external intervention. That internationalization of the conflict is particularly dangerous and must be averted before it can lead to an outbreak of hostilities whose magnitude and consequences could extend far beyond Central America.302.	We therefore support the regional approach as the most promising. We support the initiatives of the Contadora Group and we encourage it to persevere in its efforts to bring about  through political dialogue and negotiations  a peaceful solution to the region's conflicts.303.	But it is not possible to discuss Latin America without mentioning Chile  a country which has for 10 years now been subjected to a military dictatorship. In the course of recent weeks  the protests of the Chilean people against its fate have been stifled in blood. We forcefully condemn the conduct of the leaders of that country and we join our voice to that of the Chilean people to demand an immediate return to democracy.304.	After having thus considered basically political questions  I should like to turn to more specifically economic issues.305.	It seems to me that the most striking fact revealed in the past year has been the vast dimensions of world indebtedness and  hence  the enormous tension to which the international financial and banking system has been subjected. In spite of these difficulties  the officials of IMF and of private and central banks have managed to avoid major crises and have found  if not permanent solutions  at least temporary compromises  which have made it possible to avoid the worst.306.	The debt problem erupted after interest rates reached dizzying heights and the longest and most serious economic crisis of the post-war period gave rise to stagnation and even a decline in world demand. According to figures of the World Bank  in 1982 most economies had negative growth rates and world trade actually decreased in volume.307.	That depressed situation has been a fertile ground for the proliferation of protectionist measures  which in turn have contributed to worsening the situation.308.	Although the vicious circle that is the inevitable result of the imposition of tariff and non-tariff barriers is a familiar one  it seems that we have not yet learned our lesson from history. Although these protectionist measures give the illusion of resolving certain problems in the short term  mainly by yielding to the demands of powerful pressure groups  it is a well-established factâ and the recent slowdown in world trade following the upsurge of international trade after the Second World War is ample proof of thisâthat in the long run protectionist measures lead to a widespread decline in the flow of goods and services  which eventually has harmful effects on all of us.309.	The international community seemed to have become aware of the danger when last autumn it convened a ministerial meeting of the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade precisely to attempt to stem this dangerous trend. Other international gatherings  such as the sixth session of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development or the Williamsburg Summit of Industrialized Nations  also produced declarations of principle about combating protectionism.310.	But now these declarations must be put into practice and we must all be prepared not only to ask that our neighbours do away with such barriers  but also to take the first step and dismantle our own protectionist measures. If this is not done  not only will we run the risk of curbing or even stifling the economic recovery emerging in certain industrialized countries  but we will also prevent the steady transfer of its beneficial effects to the world economy as a whole. Are we prepared to pay that price for a few short-term gains?311.	I hope that we are all aware of the magnitude of the stakes and that we shall be able to make a reasonable response. A world economic recovery is in fact by far the most effective means  if not of overcoming our economic difficulties  at least of alleviating them.312.	Whether it be in respect of the debt problem  the question of the development of industry and trade  the distribution of resources between the North and South or the distribution of national income within each of our countries  only sound and stable growth offers realistic prospects for the recovery of national economies and therefore for an increased transfer of resources from North to South. That is what is really at stake in our struggle against protectionism.313.	It would in fact be unforgivable to hinder the recovery of the world economy on which such hopes have been pinned. The consequences for the North-South dialogue seem evident to me. The re-establishment of sound and stable growth would considerably increase the possibilities of the resumption of that highly desirable process  whether in the framework of global negotiations or a step by step sectoral approach.314.	Those are the main issues on which I wished to speak. Every year the list of our problems becomes longer without our really being able to remove questions from the agenda and consider them resolved. Some of those questions have remained with us year after year  and some even date from the founding of the United Nations. This is an unhealthy situation which tends to undermine the credibility of the Organization  credibility that is more than ever necessary in our tormented world.315.	The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization last year ' raised this problem and requested the co-operation of Member States and  in particular  of the members of the Security Council to remedy the situation by attempting to increase the effectiveness of peace-keeping operations. That report  which has been a constant source of reflection  prompted many reactions from Member States and from the Security Council.316.	We hope that this will apply as well to the report that the Secretary-General submitted this year. We commend the realistic and lucid way in which he has analyzed both the international situation and the functioning of the Organization. While fully aware of the difficulties inherent in the work of the Secretary-General  we should like to encourage him again to persevere in the task on which he has embarked so courageously.317.	We believe that this process of reflection is highly desirable and we hope that it will lead to a genuine improvement of the functioning of the world Organization. It seems to us that the Charter contains all the provisions Necessary for that purpose  but the problem is how to implement it and how to realize its full potential. That  of course  depends first and foremost on the attitude of the Member States  on what we ourselves want to make of the Organization.318.	We hope that the serious economic crisis which has troubled the world in recent years will have made us more realistic  more pragmatic and more able to distinguish between what is feasible and what is not. If we want to increase the effectiveness of the Organization  let us not make demands that we know from the start to be unattainable; let us not defend positions that we know to be untenable; and let us be aware of that interdependence so often invoked but so rarely respected.319.	I believe that the main point of the contribution that can be made by a small State such as Luxembourg to a debate such as this is the lesson in realism  pragmatism and moderation.320.	Whatever solutions are finally decided on  it seems to me that those which are sometimes neglected virtues will be essential in developing the capacity of the United Nations for action and making it an instrument capable of meeting the goals defined in Article 1 of the Charter  that is: to maintain international peace and security; to develop friendly relations among nations; to achieve international co-operation; and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of those common ends."
"85",4340,"MAR",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 It is a great honour for me to address the Assembly in the name of Morocco  making the statement that is traditional at the opening of every session.2.	Numerous and varied subjects will be discussed during the current session  and we cannot say that one is more important or has higher priority than the others. I do not want to speak at length by enumerating the items on the agenda  and I do not want to mention all the documents available here. I shall confine myself to two issuesâone to do with the Middle East and the other to do with Africa.3.	As all representatives know  there was held last year in the city of Fez a conference which we called the Fez Summit Conference. After much lengthy  serious and purposeful work  the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference formulated a plan' which was well balanced and much discussed. Of the many descriptions given to it  the most important was that it made clear  practical and feasible recommendations unblemished by rhetoric or demagoguery.4.	We  the Arab kings  presidents and other heads of State  were able to reach the result that we did at the Fez Conference because at that timeâI repeat ""at that time"" âwe put aside everything that would have caused a split in our ranks. Each of us rose above the conflicts and disputes of the past  and with God's help we reached the conclusions of the Fez Conference.5.	As if by a happy coincidence  two days before the Conference the President of the United States announced his peace plan  known as the Reagan plan. We saw in that coincidence and the meeting of minds at Fez something that augured well for the future. I do not say that it promised success  but it gave grounds for optimism.856.	The Fez Conference decided to form a member committee  headed by the Chairman of the Conference  the one now humbly addressing you. The other members are from Algeria  Tunisia  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  the Syrian Arab Republic and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Conference instructed this Committee of Seven to travel to the capitals of the States permanent members of the Security Council and also entrusted it with a mission to Washington to ascertain the details of the Reagan peace plan and to explain the Fez plan. We carried out our duty in Washington  Paris  London  Moscow and Peking.7.	Moreover  because of the importance of this Assembly and its impact on the course of events  the Committee of Seven decided that I should make a statement here in which I would try to explain the details of the Fez plan and say what bridges might be built  after dialogue  between the Reagan plan and the Fez plan.8.	We must be realistic and frank about historical facts. At first events went just as they should  and we made rapid progress  thank God. But unfortunately our horse began to feel weary  so to speak  and our enthusiasm waned. Since then the Committee of Seven has not met to assess objectively and clearly the results of its travels to the United States  the United Kingdom  France  the Soviet Union and China. If we had met to analyze and assess our work and its results  we could have kept the political and diplomatic dynamism without which no plan can be successful and yield results.9.	But  as I said  dark clouds loomed over the Arab ranks  and certain kings and heads of State procrastinated in meeting to assess and plan the next step. A few months later we were shocked by the Lebanese bomb  which became an obstacle impeding our advance towards further results. The Lebanese bomb exploded as if the enemy chose to have that explosion at that time because he knew the Arabs well. We have to say frankly that the enemy thus put a small tree in front of us  the Arab leaders. We are behind that tree and have lost our view of the forest. We had thought that by solving the problem of one country  an extremely complex problem in view of the multiplicity of ethnic communities  religions and factions  we would solve the general problem. We walked blindly into the trap set by the common enemy. We naively believed that we could solve the general Arab problem by solving that of Lebanon. Thus  as I have mentioned  we sat blocked behind that small tree instead of reaching the goal. That is why  as I said before  we lost perspective.10.	Here I wish to appeal that we correct our mistakes  mobilize our forces and spirits  you and we the Arab States  to get a second wind  in order to find a way out of this trap  which is inaction. The worst enemy of any constructive policy is inertia.11.	Here  through my own personal efforts  I am able to propose the following action with regard to the Lebanese issue  which has dominated all aspects of the Arab problem. In all frankness we have to request either the United Statesâbecause the United States was the party that was watching over the Israeli-Lebanese agreementâ or the General Assembly to reconsider the Lebanese- Israeli agreement. In other words  it is an agreement between the lion and the Iamb  but this is inconceivable  because no person of conscience can feel gratified  nor any politically intelligent person be convinced by it.12.	It may well be remembered that in 1975 an agreement was signed in Algeria between Iran and Iraq. That agreement was a one-sided agreement because Iran at that time had technological and military superiority over the Republic of Iraq. After a few years the Iraqis discarded the agreement of 1975 because it was unbalanced and one-sided. Thus we are witnessing the tragedy of the Iraqi- Iranian conflict  a war between two fraternal Islamic countries that have common bonds of history  civilization and religion  which provide eternal common links between them.13.	This is why  as far as the Arab issue in particular is concerned  I appeal to all those of good will and even to our adversary  saying  ""If you are the adversary we know  wise and with a history  religion and genius  you ought yourself to request reconsideration of this agreement you have concluded with Lebanon  because otherwise you are building on sand  and it is not possible for two peoples or two neighbouring countries to build their future on sand or on unequal agreements that would require lions to live with lambs in peace and safety.""14.	My task  as Chairman of the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference and as Chairman of the Committee of Seven  will end with this session of the Conference. I wish on this occasion to inform all my Arab brethren that during the short time that stands between now and the Riyadh conference  they will find  as always  in Hassan II  King of Morocco  the faithful servant of the Arab cause and an honest and steadfast supporter of the rights of the Palestinians and the people of Palestine.15.	I shall now turn to the second problem  that of Africa.16.	I could continue in Arabic  but I think our African brothers who speak English or French will understand me more directly in French.17.	Immediately after its independence  Morocco  which had had the great misfortune of being colonized simultaneously by two countries  France and Spain  and having been divided up into four zonesâthe international zone of Tangier  the Spanish protectorate zone  the French protectorate zone  the Sidi Ifni and Sahara zone- came before this very Assembly and called immediately for the recovery of its territorial unity. It did so in official documents which we submitted to the Secretary-General.18.	As time went by and the years passed  we able to recover the international zone of Tangier; we were able to recover the Sidi Ifni enclave and  finally  we were able to recover the province of Tarfaya.19.	There remained the Sahara  which was known as Western Sahara and still is so known. For the Spanish  there was no doubt that Western Sahara had to be returned to its legitimate inhabitants  namely  the Saharans  who at the time were represented in the Jemala  which was an elected assembly. The following was Morocco's attitude. When Spain took possession of that territory  the Sahara was by no means Terra Nullins. That means that before occupying it  Spain had first expelled the legitimate inhabitants and owners of the land. Seeing that the dialogue was becoming a dialogue of the deaf  we immediately asked the Assembly to be good enough to take this question to the International Court of Justice at The Hague  which is one of its consultative bodies in matters of international law  so as clearly to ask the following question: When Spain colonized the territory of Spanish Sahara  did it find there a terra nullisâa land without owner or citizensâor did it by force and occupation take over the sovereignty and administration exercised by Morocco over that part of its territory?20.	On 16 October 1975  the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice left no room for ambiguity and recognized that there were links of allegiance between the Kingdom of Morocco and the tribes of Western Sahara. Strengthened by that confirmation  Morocco immediately entered into negotiations with Madrid which led to the tripartite treaty  ratified by the United Nations itself.21.	We thought that we would thenceforth be able to live at ease in our recovered territories in complete peace  prosperity and co-operation  both with our neighbours on the east and those on the south. But  as the Arab poet says  the winds do not always blow to the ship's liking. The winds were not favourable for tripartite co-operation among Morocco  Algeria and Mauritaniaâhence began that false war  that war which has no name but is known as the war of the Sahara.22.	We thought a great deal about the tragedy that was facing us  pitting us against each other and preventing us from realizing our economic and social ideals in the region. Many African countriesârightly or wronglyâ said that it was absolutely necessary to hold a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara. Morocco  relying on its rights  its history and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice  refusedâas long as it couldâto agree to that referendum.23.	But since the dialogue seemed to be interminable  prejudicial not only to the present but also to the future and to the very unity of the Organization of African Unity  we decided to give the appropriate response to the three interlocutors we had. There were those who disregarded the whole matter  those who wanted to disregard it and those who still do not want to understand anything about it. Taking our courage in both hands  the Moroccan people and its King took the most distressing and painful decision of agreeing to prove what had been already proven by history  facts and law. In 1981  we went to Nairobi and officially proposed  on two occasions  that a referendum be held in the Sahara  for the reconciliation of Africa and to teach those who were unaware of things  to demystify the facts for those who were trying to disregard them all and to instil some wisdom into those who still did not want to understand anything.24.	At the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  a unanimous decision was taken  by consensus  to agree that there should be a referendum on self- determination in the Sahara  in accordance with the wishes and commitment expressed by Morocco  and it entrusted to a committee of heads of State the task of determining the procedures for the holding of that referendum. Meeting at Nairobi in the same year  the heads of State who had been designated as the Implementation Committee  and in whose work we personally took part frankly  sincerely and loyally  decided on the measures concerning the referendum/ The territorial area to be covered by the referendum was indicated on a map  as decided on by the OAU  from the east to the west  from the north to the south. The Implementation Committee decided how the Saharans were to vote and where the polling stations would be located. It decided that the Saharans would have to vote at their birthplace. Finally  respect for legality  the validity and honesty of the referendum would be entrusted to observers from the OAU  assisted by observers from the United Nations.25.	Today  for the first time in the United Nations but for the umpteenth time before public opinion  Morocco says and solemnly declares  through the voice of him whom God has designated to preside over the destiny Of my country  that it wants that referendum. Morocco tells you that it is ready for the referendum to take placeâ tomorrow  if you wish it. Morocco is ready to grant all facilities to any observers from wherever they may come so that there may be a cease-fire and a just  equitable and true consultation. And  finally  Morocco solemnly undertakes to consider itself bound by the results of that referendum.26.	I believe that I have said all that can be said on these two important issues without delving into other matters. I hope the Assembly has found in my statement and from my tone of voice that I have tried to speak on both issues with conviction  conscience and the utmost sincerity and faith in our Arab cause and the future of the African continent. These are both important and vital elements for the august community which God wanted to be one of love and peace  not war and discord  the community which members of the Assembly represent here. I wish all representatives  from the bottom of my heart  success and progress towards happiness for all mankind. "
"86",4435,"MDG",38,1983,"ï»¿ Mr. President  it is my privilege to addressto you today  on behalf of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  our warm congratulations and sincere wishes for success. We know your talents as a jurist and a diplomat and your qualities as a statesman which you have so often and so successfully used in the service of your country and of your region  of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and of the United Nations  and they augur well for our present session.1.	To your predecessor  the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic  our colleague of long standing  Mr. Imre Hollai  we renew our great respect and special thanks for the calm  rational and effective way in which he conducted our work.2.	We reiterate our confidence in and support for the Secretary-General  whose reports on our activities have provoked clear and salutary thought on the state of international relations and the role befitting our institutions.3.	Lastly  we are pleased to welcome among us Saint Christopher and Nevis.4.	It has been said that the delegations from the third world come to the United Nations to present their demands  describe their difficulties and explain their concerns and then go home with reassurances and promises that are sometimes not kept  because reality determines otherwise. We detect this general feeling of frustration at every session  as it is true that the hopes for the improvement of the world situation are dashed by events and incidents the seriousness of which we recognize.5.	Indeed  wherever we look  we see only disorder and confusion. Economic  monetary and financial disorder! Disorder in political relations and confusion in ideological relations! Disorder and confusion in assigning responsibility for ensuring peace and understanding among nations and for ensuring full development for peoples in the best possible conditions.6.	This year again  we are far from the global security provided for by the Charter  because we cannot reach agreement on the methods to be used  on the procedure to follow or even on the meaning of the concept. Generalized war  we are told  has so far been avoided  but regional conflicts continue to be manipulated and the great fear of nuclear war grips all peoples without exception.7.	Furthermore  since recovery seems to be confirmed in certain countries  statements are being made advocating a dialogue to deal with the crises of growth and development  while nevertheless encouraging the maintenance of several grey areas concerning the objectives  content and format of such a dialogue.8.	One should not therefore be astonished if peoples  particularly the peoples of the third world  seek new ways to ensure peace and development  in the absence of a security system whose establishment has been prevented by obstacles arising from mistrust  the promotion of selfish interests  the determination to perpetuate an outdated state of affairs and the decline of what the Secretary- General  in his latest report on the work of the Organization  calls multilateralism and internationalism.9.	Our peoples are hardly familiar with the cryptic language of politico-military circles concerning ballistic missiles  strategic bombers or intermediate nuclear forces. But can one really wish them to be other than particularly interested in the peace movements and in initiatives advocating the non-use of force  the non-use of nuclear weapons and the demilitarization and denuclearization of zones of peace and outer space?10.	Can we be blamed too for insisting that it is essential to continue disarmament negotiations and not to use them as mere window-dressing or as one more pawn in the East-West confrontation?11.	We have the night and the duty to insist on this  all the more so because we are all concerned by the over- armament of the great Powers and because cold-war animosities are re-emerging. The situation is such that we have the unpleasant impression that we have become the hostages of concepts which primarily serve selective strategies.12.	In this connection  we recall that a five-point plan was recently proposed for the Mediterranean  providing for the limitation of naval activities  the reduction of naval equipment  confidence-building measures  the withdrawal of vessels equipped with nuclear weapons and the non-deployment of nuclear weapons in coastal and hinterland States. Of course  we maintain the specific nature of the Indian Ocean. But if this plan is good enough for the Mediterranean then it is also good enough for the Indian Ocean; it could even be applied to other regions that wish to be zones of peace. In this connection the great Powers and blocs should decree a moratorium  with the idea of subsequently limiting  reducing and eliminating all military activity there.13.	It would be naive of us  however  to believe that nuclear disarmament will help make our peoples more secure. Indeed  what security can there be when we see the transfer and the crystallization of international tensions in regions regarded  rightly or wrongly  as strategic?14.	In the case of Chad  for example  the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  which recognizes the legitimacy conferred by the Lagos agreements concluded with the endorsement of the Organization of African Unity [AU]  is opposed to any attempt to internationalize a conflict that primarily concerns the Chadians themselves. However  it was seen fit at one time to resort to means out of all proportion to the African dimension of the problem. We can understand  nevertheless  the recourse to machinery in an agreement for co-operation between the Chadian movement and a foreign Power. An argument has been put forward by our regional organization to promote reconciliation and reconstruction through negotiations. It would be more advantageous  we believe  to help the Chadians to explore the feasibility of this approach rather than to insert the problem of Chad within the context of possible great Power confrontation.15.	The same argument applies to Namibia. The right of the Namibians to peace and security must be attained through independence and not through the establishment of an arbitrary link between the return to international legality and the imposition on the People's Republic of Angola of conditions incompatible with its sovereignty. If we want to talk about securityâalthough the South African regime is scarcely concerned about the security of its neighbouring States  near or farâif we really want to talk about security  my Government advocates dispatching a pan-African or international peace-keeping force to Namibia's frontiers  once independence has been obtained in keeping with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) or  in default of that  proclaimed by the United Nations under the aegis of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO].16.	It is ironic that certain circles attach importance to the requirements of the apartheid minority regime  which is only concerned with human rights and the rights of people in order to Rout and repress them. We cannot agree that this regime  which does not recognize any right of the African majority  should become the regional policeman. Hypocrisy has become accommodating. The cause of Africa should not be further betrayed  and we reiterate our support for the African National Congress in its struggle for national liberation.17.	Lastly  in the Western Sahara  which remains the key to peace and security in the sub-region  the efforts of the OAU have had their ups and downs. The interests of the Saharan people  whom we fully support in their quest for freedom and justice  must prevail. The OAU has committed 5iself to preserving these interests by recommended direct negotiations between Morocco and POLISARIG o establish a cease-fire and a referendum free from military or administrative pressureâin other words  after the withdrawal of the Moroccan troops and administration. We have no ambition to make or rewrite history  but to ignore the consensus which arose around this problem during the last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity would endanger the already difficult task of the Implementation Committee  and the credibility and future of the OAU.18.	To reduce tension and eliminate regional conflicts through political settlements strictly conceived outside any East-West confrontation and with due consideration for the rights of peoples and nations to pf e and security  as well as for the fundamental principles of sovereignty  mutual respect and non-interferenceâthis is still our position on the other problems before us.19.	Thus  we continue to support the just proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the reunification of the Korean homeland which would be independent  peaceful and free from outside interference. We also call for the implementation of the declaration on South-East Asia  issued by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries a declaration that thecountries of Indo-China and those of the Association of South-East Asian Nations	have already accepted as a basis for dialogue. We follow with interest developments in the talks on the situation in South-West Asia  in keeping with the guidelines set forth by the special representative of the Secretary-General  which is an approach already advocated by Afghanistan itself. We call on Iraq and Iran to put an end to a fratricidal and senseless war  and we support the initiatives of the Contadora Group and of other States to ensure that democracy  security and stability shall be enjoyed by the peoples of Central America.20.	The questions of the Middle East and Palestine have distinct characteristics  if only because of the responsibility directly assumed by the United Nations with respect to the State of Palestine and the Palestinians for the last 40 years.21.	Conditions of peace will not be met as long as the Palestinians remain a people without land or rights  as long as Israel persists in its politically and legally unfounded argument that its sovereignty over the occupied territories is an established fact  and as long as domination and fragmentation of the Arab environment on the political  economic and social levels persist.22.	The multiplication of treaties and always partial agreements  the proliferation over decades of often partial plans lead us to think that it is time to call  as advocated by the recent International Conference on the Question of Palestine  an international conference on the Middle East in which Palestine  represented by its liberation organization  would necessarily take part.23.	We shall refer again to Lebanon  not to treat it as a separate issue but to express the hope that the unity  stability and preservation of the territorial integrity of Lebanon will be achieved thanks to the recent cease-fire which was agreed to by the parties involved.24.	In connection with the economic section of my statement  I will not go into a detailed analysis of the causes and effects of the crisis because these were dealt with masterfully by senior authorities at New Delhi  Buenos Aires  Belgrade  Geneva and Washington  as well as in other places. It is commendable that it was possible to adhere to the timetable of meetings and that major questions were debated. Nevertheless  the results of this succession of multilateral meetings failed to come up to expectations  perhaps because we entertained too many illusions or were unduly ambitious. The more likely reason is that it is still hard to reconcile our differences.25.	Be that as it may  since optimism is a human quality  we are condemned to persevere and to succeed. However  there are intolerable situations which cannot await the result of complex negotiations. We have in mind  in particular  Africa  a continent which stands most in need of development but which development seems to have forgotten.26.	A brief look at the facts suffices: the average rate of growth in African countries has fallen over the last three years from 4.4 per cent to 0.6 per cent; the annual income of the inhabitants today is lower than it was 20 years ago; the terms of trade have worsened by a total of about 20 per cent over five years; the overall current deficit is estimated at $12 billion and the foreign debt has increased nearly seven-fold in over 10 years  while the average debt-servicing ratio has more than doubled.27.	Given that plainly gloomy state of affairs  our concern will undoubtedly be shared by the industrialized countries  whatever their economic and social system. The economic recovery which has been forecast will have no effect or will be feeble at best  because the economic and financial difficulties of the African countries will reduce the demand for the exports of the industrialized countries and will thus increase unemployment in some of them.28.	It is in the interest of all  therefore  to launch the emergency programme for Africa now in order to avoid the economic collapse of the most seriously affected countries. That programme would supplement the structural adjustment measures agreed to by our countries at the cost of additional sacrifices but which can be achieved only with co-operation on the part of the whole international community  given the fact that the origin of most of our problems lies outside our countries.29.	The programme could include the provision of additional financial resources by increasing official development assistance and by organizing the programmes and procedures for the provision of loans by international financial institutions; continued support for the African Development Bank group  in particular with regard to the fourth general replenishment of the resources of the African Development Fund; withdrawal of protectionist measures  lowering trade barriers and opening markets to our goods; and new measures of debt relief  which would include the rescheduling of all our debts and the extension of repayment periods with no penalties for late payment.30.	That programme would have prospects of succeeding if it were accompanied by a reduction of the interest rates of the main international financial centers and the limitation of fluctuations in interest rates.31.	Those are only short-term measures concerning a particular region which is beset by exceptional circumstances. But our solidarity with the rest of the third world cannot be qualified and we cannot sufficiently emphasize the important and urgent need to restructure international economic relations on a democratic  just and equitable basis. We remain convinced that this profound change can be brought about only within the framework of global negotiations  which have been delayed for four years by the negative political will of certain of our partners. In the mean time  initiatives have been taken  such as the organization of an international conference on monetary and financial means of development or the convening of an international monetary conference at the highest level.32.	We support these two conferences and these initiatives  but we believe they should not be considered preconditions for launching global negotiations but rather integral parts of the negotiations after the negotiations are under way.33.	Furthermore  it would be abnormal and contrary to our position on collective self-reliance for us to stake everything on the North-South dialogue. South-South co-operation is important  because countries of the third world are determined to preserve their economic independence  strengthen their negotiating power and harmonize their diverse interests.34.	The attainment of those goals presupposes that we can choose the institutional means and set up the appropriate operational instruments. In this context  the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar took the initiative four years ago of proposing the establishment of three funds to promote effective solidarity in the monetary  development and raw material fields  in order to strengthen the complementary links between our economies and ensure for ourselves a role at the international level.35.	It is not a question of organizing the South against the North or of competing with existing international institutions. Our efforts are complementary but not mutually exclusive  because unless we want the new economic order to remain a mirage of the ?970s and 1980s  we must all heed the appeal made at New Delhi by the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries for collective action to bring about world-wide prosperity.36.	By their permanence or recurrence and because we have not been able to overcome them  the political and economic crises have exacerbated the climate of insecurity in international relations and kept the peoples in a state of uncertainty concerning their right to well-being and social progress. However  they have had the merit of giving the concepts of peace  security and development new dimensions  in keeping with the requirements of shared responsibility  and of provoking a salutary reaction to attempts to impose on multilateral relations an approach inspired by bilateral relations.37.	Whatever the motives for this latest development  it can only stiffen the confrontation and make the breach inevitable and final by relegating to the margins those of us that cannot agree to become pawns in a game carried on without our knowledge. In a world which is divided and stratified  only firm adherence to multilateralism will enable us to appreciate the facets of divergent interests  to resume a dialogue on which the credibility and effectiveness of our institutions will depend and to ensure the attainment of a world in peace with itself  thanks to the establishment of a just  democratic and equitable new order.38.	Here lies the essence of non-alignment  which cannot be reduced to a mere balancing act but rather presupposes the rejection of all forms of subjection  dependence  interference  intervention or pressure in international relations  in order to be able to judge according to merit on the basis of national independence and commitments based on universally accepted principles. In other words  if we have to be aligned  let us be aligned with just causes  the aspirations of our peoples and the purposes and principles of the Charter. "
"87",4473,"MDV",38,1983,"ï»¿143.	I hasten to express the shock and deep concern of my delegation over the tragic incident which occurred in Rangoon last Sunday  resulting in the deaths and injury of so many people. We convey our sincere condolences to the Governments of the Republic of Korea and Burma and to the members of the bereaved families.144.	Mr. President  I join my colleagues who spoke before me in offering our sincere felicitations on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that your wide experience and knowledge will assist you in guiding our deliberations efficiently.145.	I should also like to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  for his tireless devotion to his duties and the undaunted manner in which he rendered his services to the United Nations during his tenure as President of the General Assembly.146.	My delegation wishes to note for the record the exemplary manner in which the Secretary-General has continued to perform his unenviable task of harnessing the resources of the international community to the noble task of upholding and preserving the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.147.	My delegation also has great pleasure in voicing its very warm and sincere welcome to the delegation of Saint Christopher and Nevis as it takes its seat among us  thus helping to further the Organization's universality.15K  The thirty-eighth session is being held at a time when the international arena is overshadowed by ever- increasing tensions. A broader and wiser political view of the world community and sustained patient efforts  with greater determination  are most vital to arrest the fast-growing threats to world peace and security. Every possible step must be taken to stem the swift growth of forces which undermine both the United Nations and peaceful international relations. Since the continuing developments amount to a dire threat to the very basic tenets of the Charter  it is up to the membership to assume its responsibilities  more than ever before  in a sincere effort to defuse the dangerously escalating international tension.152. My delegation strongly feels that this session should not be allowed to pass without renewed commitments by every Member of the Organization to do its utmost to prevent  if not reverse  the continuing deterioration in international relations caused by increasing  over-ambitious political adventurism  so that nations big or small  rich or poor  weak or powerful  can enjoy their inalienable rights in an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence. As we see it  none of us  as a Member of this august body and therefore fully committed to the Charter  can spare any effort to make a maximum contribution for the achievement of peace  justice and the preservation of orderly international behaviour.153.	Developments in the Middle East  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  South America and southern Africa have  in the view of my delegation  created such levels of tension throughout the world that we must wonder fearfully how long the international situation will remain without a major conflagration. What distresses us most is the fact that more and more often the fundamental ethics of the Charter are being abandoned or ignored under the pretext of so-called national security or strategic interests  and as a result there is already chaos and anarchy in many parts of the world.154.	We view these developments as extremely grave and serious. Indeed  certain developments seem to justify a growing feeling that peoples and nations will be worthy of consideration only if they serve the interests of a greater Power. Our task is to strive  and strive hard  for a better world. In this spirit  we respectfully appeal to the Organization's Members not to delay any longer decisive and specific action to stem the deterioration in international relations.155.	It is the considered opinion of my delegation that disarmament should be the priority area for consideration. It is no secret that the threat of a nuclear confrontation  which in the past appeared on the far horizon  has steadily drawn closer and now seems to be hovering just over us. Right now we are seeing an alarming increase in the production not only of nuclear weapons but also of all other types of weapons of mass destruction  including so-called conventional weapons. Deployment of satellites and other spacecraft for military purposes  including nuclear warfare  has added horrifying dimensions to the already dangerous situation. My delegation has always strongly supported every effort of the world community to stop the arms race and work towards complete disarmament.156.	It is a well-known fact that today  while more than half of the population of the world are struggling hard to attain minimum basic essential needs for existence  a few countries which enjoy the benefits of abundant natural resources  wealth and technology seem to be quite happy to invest billions of dollars in production and improvement of nuclear and other weapons of war. My delegation will continue to render every possible support to the work of the Organization to make this world a safer place for mankind.157.	The Middle East remains in a most dangerous state. Developments during the past year have increased the gravity of the situation. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the refusal of the Israeli Government to withdraw its troops from Lebanese territory have added new dimensions to an already explosive situation created by their refusal to withdraw from the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967.158.	The international community has witnessed with alarm and indignation Israel's continued policy of illegal annexation of more territories of the occupied land and also  as if that were not enough  its masterminding of greater chaos in Lebanon  commissioning of acts of blatant aggression and violation of all the norms of international law and decent human behaviour.159.	The Assembly cannot overlook in any way the outright rejection by Israel of the numerous United Nations resolutions. Its actions have not only condemned thousands of innocent men  women and children to suffer death  destruction and loss of property  but also have initiated a gathering momentum which could well spark off a conflagration that could not be restricted to a single country or region. It is therefore imperative that the world community give every possible support to strengthen the present cease-fire in Lebanon and take positive steps without any delay to stop the extension of this continuous aggression to any further level. Even the States which sympathize with Israel cannot deny the fact that its arrogance and expansionist policy are responsible for building up tension to the present dangerously high level.160.	We are all committed to the Charter. Its provisions are binding on all nations who are Members of this world body  and no Member State can haw any right to be an exception. Permanent membership in the Security Council in no way grants any power to a country to create  directly or by proxy  a situation favourable only to that country in any part of the world. If every Member of the Organization is sincere about its commitment to the provisions of the Charter  action should not be delayed any longer regarding the situation in the Middle East. We must ask the Security Council to invoke the relevant provisions of the Charter with regard to the arrogance and defiance with which Israel is trying to trample on the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. These rights must include their right to return to their homeland and the unimpaired freedom to establish their own nation and decide on their own destiny. The PLO  which is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  must have the full right to participate in any steps that may be taken to achieve this end. In the opinion of my delegation  the Geneva Declaration on Palestine  issued last month presents a sound framework for the international community and the parties concerned to work for a solution of this issue.161.	Among other matters of major international concern are the questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. These are two countries which  we believe  have been victims of foreign military interventions and invasions. We express our deepest concern regarding these two countries because we fully endorse the United Nations resolutions which condemn such interventions and call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from those two territories. That would enable the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea to decide freely on their own destiny. One of the prerequisites in the case of each is for the refugees to return to their homes with security and honour. My delegation notes with deep appreciation and commendation the unceasing efforts of the Secretary-General to find solutions to these two major issues.162.	It is with alarm  dismay and frustration that we witness the increasing instances of foreign intervention in areas of Africa and Latin America. As we see it  there is not much of a difference in direct or indirect intervention or interference. The end result in either case is tragically the same: tension  unrest  internal strife  conflicts and even bloodshed. We view such developments with the utmost concern because they are destroying not only the very fabric of international peace and security  but also the concept of peaceful co-existence. Never for a moment should we forget that we are all family of interrelated and interdependent nations with diverse political ideologies  economies and social systems  whose members must live together in an atmosphere which is devoid of suspicion  envy and animosity.163.	The question of south-west Africa and the sad and tragic plight of the people of South Africa has continued to be a matter of grave concern to the world community for a long time. In spite of persistent and repeated expressions of serious concern and indignation by the international community  the people of Namibia have been forced to remain under a regime illegally imposed upon them by the racist Government of Pretoria. Like Israel in the Middle East  the minority regime of South Africa has acted with scorn towards the numerous resolutions approved by this body in full accord with the provisions of the Charter. The Pretoria regime has flagrantly violated the Charter and all norms of international law and codes of human conduct with regard both to Namibia and the majority people of South Africa.164.	My delegation  as in the past  gives its full support to the oppressed people of South Africa itself  which remains under the inhuman policy of apartheid  and to the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO. We assert that the General Assembly should request the Security Council to act without any further delay to invoke the relevant provisions of the Charter while the world community exerts greater political and economic pressures on the Pretoria regime in order to force it to accept the realities of the present era and act with sanity before it is too late.165.	It is a matter of regret for us that there has been very little advance  if any  with regard to the situation in Cyprus. The extremely slow progress made thus far in the dialogue between the parties concerned is being constantly outpaced by the tension prevailing there. We still believe that meaningful negotiations must be pursued sincerely with a view to achieving a just and lasting solution whereby the rights of the communities of that long-suffering country can be restored in a manner which will preserve peace in the country and ensure stability and economic development for the people.166.	The peaceful reunification of the divided people of Korea has been and continues to be a matter of great interest to us. The lack of positive contact between the people of the North and South for the realization of the national aspirations of the people of Korea tends to create further unrest  tension and instability. We believe that the international community should extend every possible support  opportunity and encouragement to the Korean people in order to assist them in achieving their objective. At the same time  we state that they must remain free from outside interference  influence and pressure in order that they may find a peaceful solution of their own choice.167.	I should like to take this opportunity to express our deepest sorrow at seeing two of our brother countries  Iran and Iraq  still waging their bitter armed conflict  which has already brought destruction and loss to hundreds of thousands. We maintain very friendly brotherly relations with both countries  and this makes our grief all the deeper. We can only express our support for the numerous appeals of the international bodies to bring about a cease-fire. We can only lend our support to the culls of the world community to these two brother countries to stop the war and find a solution to their disputes by peaceful means. We also pledge our support to the Sectary-General's mediation efforts as well as to those of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  all of which are designed to bring about an honourable settlement to the dispute.168.	Let me now turn to our region of the globe. As on previous occasions  I wish to express the immediate and deep concern of our country at the steadily escalating tension created by the great-Power rivalry for military superiority in the Indian Ocean. My delegation wishes to reaffirm our full support for the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We believe that tension will continue to mount as long as foreign military bases and other such facilities remain in our area. If that trend continues  disputes can easily lead to conflicts in which those foreign military forces will have a stake. That is a very familiar chain of action and reaction in many parts of the world. On our part  we shall do everything possible  along with the other countries of the region  to prevent our area from being subjected to such potential dangers.169.	I need hardly mention that another inevitable development consequent to big-Power military rivalry and their presence in our region is the time  money and other resources which have to be utilized to step up security and defence levels in various countries. During this era of world economic chaos  we can ill-afford that course of action.170.	We fully support the efforts of the United Nations to implement the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We appeal to the world community to renew its efforts to that end. We strongly feel that the proposed conference on the Indian Ocean  to be held at Colombo  is a step that must be taken with the least delay. We remain firmly convinced that this conference will form a milestone in the march towards the achievement of our cherished objective.171.	The attention and concern of the world community necessarily has to be focused on the international economic scene. Although certain glimmers of hope are observed on the horizon  the lack of will on the part of the developed countries to initiate fast  effective steps  based on interdependence  to remedy the deteriorating world economy has been most disappointing. My delegation feels that the severe strain on the international trade  finance and monetary systems is an ominous sign of a possible trade war. The failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade earlier this year  to produce any encouraging results has brought frustration to the developing countries.172.	It is true that the current economic crisis affects all groups of countries. However  the developing countries are feeling the impact in a way which cracks the foundation of their economic growth and impairs their prospects for years to come. We wish to emphasize the urgent need for the developed or industrialized countries to appreciate the futility of pursuing the old economic order  which can only result in further setbacks from which there can be no insulation even for themselves.173.	With regard to the current economic confusion the world over  we consider that on the whole the developing world has considerable resources  manpower and scope for technological advancement and new investments.174.	My delegation further records the tragic plight of the least developed countries which suffer most in their earnest bid to lay out the best possible infrastructure for economic growth. Particularly distressing is the fact that the least developed countries suffer from the added disadvantage of having to struggle against a lack of manpower and natural resources. The country we represent here belongs to that group of countries  and sty comments are not based on speculation but on the factual situation we face. In spite of our gloomy economic environment  we have trial our utmost to maintain a path of progress consistent with the theme of self-reliance. It is indeed a tedious uphill task. Nevertheless  we have attempted to make optimum use of whatever resources we have been able to muster.175.	One of the most disturbing problems for the developing countries  and more particularly for the least developed countries  during the past decade has been their balance-of-payments position. The abrupt swings in the prices of primary commodities  food and energy  the continued escalation in the prices of manufactured goods  the decrease in the import demands of the developed countries  the steady rise in the interest rates during the last three or four years  the fall in primary commodity prices during the same period and  above all  the alarming increase in the practice of protectionism have brought with them a series of continuous shock-waves resulting in near economic disaster for many of the third world and least developed countries.176.	The only silver lining around the dark cloud I have just mentioned is the fact that the most industrialized and developed countries of the world had apparently given some serious consideration to the submissions of the developing countries during the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We also feel that repeated submissions of the least developed countries at all international forums on our developmental efforts have made some impact upon the developed countries  and it is our earnest hope that the recommendations of the 1981 United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries s would be given greater consideration. I must mention here that the round- table meeting held at Geneva in May this year has given my country some encouragement that will help us to invest greater energy into our economic development.177.	To conclude my statement  I should like to reaffirm our commitment to the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to reaffirm our faith and trust in the Organization  the most useful instrument for the preservation and maintenance of world peace enabling the realization of the cherished ambitions of mankind for peaceful coexistence  justice  progress and prosperity.178.	Finally  may I use this opportunity to appeal to the world community not to support the tendency to overlook or bypass the United Nations in certain instances of disputes or conflicts  because we trust  as I am sure all Members do  that the United Nations is  and must always be  the most effective weapon at our disposal in the interest of international peace and security. On our part  my delegation unreservedly supports the valiant efforts of the Secretary-General to further the cause of international peace  and pledges our fullest cooperation in all sincerity."
"88",4519,"MEX",38,1983,"ï»¿ Mr. President  I offer you my warmest congratulations on your election to preside over the work of this session  for which there are great expectations of peace and international co-operation  so necessary to the commitment undertaken by Governments and nations. Mexico and Panama have strong bonds of friendship; they share goals and beliefs that lead them to act in unison in the international sphere and to take joint initiatives in Latin America.Indeed  it was on Contadora Island that we  along with Colombia and Venezuela  took diplomatic steps to solve  by reducing tension and by political understanding  the conflicts in Central America which pose such a serious danger to the region and world coexistence.The Government of Mexico is confident that your efforts as President of the General Assembly will indeed be productive. Your political and diplomatic experience  joined with the collaboration of Member States  will undoubtedly contribute to dispelling anxieties and strengthening confidence in the Organization and in the future of international relations.The activities of the Secretary-General also lead us to expect more imaginative and coherent multilateral action.The Organization's spirit of universality has been enriched by the membership of Saint Christopher and Nevis. We welcome that membership and extend to the Government and people of that country our fraternal greetings.In this statement which I have the honour to make in the Assembly  when I am speaking for the first time on behalf of the Government of President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado  I wish to reaffirm the unbreakable continuity of Mexico's foreign policy and of its active commitment to the principles of international coexistence. I should like also to express the full confidence of the President of Mexico in the vocation and capacity of international bodies to ensure international peace and security and to meet the needs of justice and fairness demanded by the developing world.In the present Central American crisis there are three basic aspects of international policy. First  there is the quest for new forms of organization that will meet the needs and aspirations of all the peoples. Secondly  there is the struggle for a regional coexistence that will take into account the legitimate interests of all the countries concerned  quite apart from global strategic confrontations. Finally  there is the certainty that there is still room for the political solution of the disputes  as the only alternative to the use of force. I should like to spell out those three aspects.The characteristics of the contemporary world are such that all States are responsible for international harmony. No country can remove itself from the problems of others  nor can it be indifferent to those problems. Thus  regional life can often provide ideas and experiences which are of general usefulness and which can contribute to the formulation of a just and peaceful international order.It is natural for developing societiesâin Africa  Asia and Latin Americaâto show a constant trend towards change. Our structures require constant revision in the quest for more advanced stages of political  economic  and social development. Despite its inherent problems and contradictions  this impulse towards renewal is both a bard fact and a potential for progress for our peoples.Within the process  which is always difficult  Latin America is today suffering from the ancient conflict between those who wish to keep an obsolete social order unchanged and those who seek to transform it. Resistance to change prolongs and aggravates the crisis and exacerbates ideological confrontation.The concentration of wealth and the fact that large social sectors are as a consequence left on the margins of society  together with the unsteady development of political institutions  leads to violence  intolerance  and restrictions on freedoms. As long as there is no real respect for individual and social rights  with the consequence that the political order as a whole does not meet the deeply felt needs of the people  the root causes of the regional malaise will remain. Bipolar confrontation has nothing to do with the true roots of the conflict in Latin America. That is why we insist on the imperative need to remove this crisis from the area of East-West confrontation and from any claims to hegemony.Lasting peace in Central America can be achieved only by means of full respect for the principles of the self- determination of peoples and of non-intervention. Systems of social organization cannot be mechanically transferred  far less be imposed in a different context. Let us allow the developing peoples themselves also to enrich mankind's political tradition through their own unique experience and talent.A change in one or more countries should not fatally endanger regional coexistence or necessarily threaten the world balance of power. In order to avoid becoming committed to the impossible goal of halting the march of history  we must respect the principle of pluralism everywhere. It is also indispensable to identify and to deal with conflicts in accordance with their specific character  without any unwarranted interference or Manichean simplifications.The aim of our peoples is development with independence and justice  not to join power blocs. In Central America the acceptance of diversity and the practice of dialogue will make stability possible  reducing the extremism which is often more the product of harassment than of want.Ever since the establishment of the United Nations  we have been able to avoid a universal conflagration. Nevertheless  we have not succeeded in preventing the proliferation of conflicts  which increasingly involve the long-term interests and goals of the major Powers.In the face of an imminent conflagration in Central America  Mexico has not hesitated to take initiatives for peace. During this year  we have joined efforts with Colombia  Panama and Venezuela in order to promote an atmosphere favourable to dialogue and negotiation among the countries of that region. Nevertheless  they are the ones that must  together with the help of the international community  establish their own framework of coexistence and solidarity.The actions of the Contadora Group are guided by three cardinal aims  detente  political understanding and co-operation. The main goal is to halt hostilities and prevent their spread. At the same time  it is necessary establish permanent conditions of security through specific agreements and effective means of verification. Furthermore  it is essential to re-establish the framework for co-operation for development which began with such great promise in Central America. Until now  we have been able to achieve reasonable success with respect to the first aim. The Contadora Group has acted as a retaining wall to prevent the spread of the Central American conflict. Serious dangers have been avoided  notably the outbreak of open war between countries and the possible extension of hostilities. Nevertheless  the continual harassment  the acts of destabilization  border tensions  war-like incidents  the arms race  the presence of advisers and foreign military interference  as well as manoeuvres designed to intimidate  have all been unfavourable to any detente in the area.But we all have a duty to continue our efforts. The countries of the Contadora Group must redouble their efforts  the States which are directly involved must display a will for peace and the members of the international community must lend active political support  free of ulterior motives  to the current efforts for peace.On 17 July last  the Presidents of Colombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuela formulated the Cancun Declaration on Peace in Central America. It reflects a high level of political determination  a quality greatly needed in these times of crisis. Our heads of State proposed a package of commitments which they believe to be feasible and necessary to ensure a gradual lessening of tension in the area.In the framework of that Declaration  the Foreign Ministers of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua recently agreed on a document"" which contains the basic elements of their commitment to achieve coexistence  security and co-operation among the five countries. Its ratification by the Governments concerned would represent meaningful progress. We would then have a first general understanding which would lead to agreements and obligations on the most serious problems of the region.The peace efforts of the Contadora Group have received the express solidarity of many Governments. They also have the support of national and international organizations and broad sectors of world public opinion. To all these we express our thanks and urge them most respectfully to persevere in this common task.In May of this year the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 530 (1983)  in which the international community is called upon actively to support our diplomatic endeavours and in which a specific mandate is conferred in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.The process we have begun in this sensitive situation requires consistent support from Member States. The Central American crisis has put to the test our capability to ensure in practice that rational policy and the law will prevail over violence.Our region has gravely suffered from the impact of the present economic crisis. In the face of the rise in interest rates  the continuation of protectionist policies and constant deterioration in the prices of raw materials  Latin America has been placed in the very difficult situation of having to divert much-needed hard currency to debt servicing. The economic upheaval leads to grave imbalances which are beginning to delay the process of modernization and institutional progress of our countries. It is inconsistent to advocate democracy in political statements and at the same time to aggravate economic inequalities which polarize societies.New obstacles have been added to the historic shortcomings of our economies. Some result from internal circumstances  others from the erratic functioning and chronic deterioration of the international economic system.We  the developing countries  know how necessary it is to achieve considerable change in our economies in order to overcome shortages and make use of available resources so as to achieve justice and productivity.Mexico has instituted a national development plan based on reality and the need to rationalize our efforts. We are acting on the basis of our recognition of the causes of the problems and confidence in our national ability to make progress in the achievement of a more efficient and democratic project.In this project  as in the efforts made internally by other countries the world economy is very much involved. It is necessary to promote an atmosphere of international co-operation and respect which will help each country in its efforts. Otherwise there would be a clear contradiction between the objectives pursued by States internally and those they are able to achieve by means of their political will working together.The economic situation is particularly harmful to the developing countries and confirms the validity of demands that have been made for a genuine dialogue between North and South. Global economic negotiationsconstitute an urgent and primary objective. Unquestionably  from the statements made so far in the Assembly's general debate  we see that that is true. We also believe in the need to adopt in all forums immediate measures to alleviate the burden of this crisis.The imbalance has become worse  although the economic recovery in some industrialized countries seems to have begun. The question to be answered is whether these signs can lead to s sustained generalized process of growth that could put an end to the opposite tendency  the trend towards an erosion of the productive capacity of many countries and the reduction of the standards of living of most of the world's population.The crisis affects all nations in different ways and to different degrees. Interdependence has become clearer in its negative manifestations. The impoverishment of the developing countries limits the possibilities for expansion of the industrialized nations. Problems in one sector of the economy are reflected in others  and we have not succeeded in creating the necessary political conditions to begin a reform of the present economic order.It is appropriate to call the attention of governments and international bodies to the fact that they must take into account the dangers to the stability of all nations presented by the imposition of formulas that place excessive pressure on the economic and social structures of the developing countries.The results of recent international economic meetings have not been encouraging. The Group of 77 is confronted with the grave responsibility of exploring  with imagination and realism  the methods available today to progress towards a restructuring of the economy.We subscribe to the agreements reached at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 7 to 12 March 1983  and at the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held at Buenos Aires from 28 March to 9 April 1983. We are pleased at the initiatives by the heads of State or Government which have been placed before the Assembly. In the next few months the necessary political will could be generated for dealing with the great economic challenges of our time with courage and a sense of responsibility.The key objectives of the North-South dialogue could be to focus on the following: recognizing the right and the ability of the developing countries to take part in the management of the world economy; stimulating international economic co-operation by the adoption of measures for immediate action in all multilateral forums; structuring the monetary and financial systems and launching urgent economic negotiations on a global basis. To sum up  a global approach must be adopted  while bearing in mind that partial progress contributes to qualitative change.We wish to stress our commitment to encouraging co-operation among the developing countries  whose potential has only begun to be tapped. South-South economic relations require a firm political will and a systematic and effective effort linking bilateral activities with regional and subregional mechanisms and with the international bodies of the developing countries. That is the only way in which we can offer a policy with true alternatives for progress and economic decolonization.The Group of 77 is the body in the United Nations system for negotiation and protection of the developing countries. It represents an indispensable entity in contemporary international relations. It has a historic role to play which will be all the more productive when the other groups of countries are ready to carry on a dialogue in a constructive and serious manner. The Group of 77 is a decisive factor in the restructuring of the world economy and therefore in the strengthening of collective security. This is something in which Mexico has always believed  and today  as we approach new and difficult responsibilities  my Government wishes to reiterate that belief.The arms race and development are incompatible. As long as we see a continuation of the unbelievable waste of money on the endless perfecting of weapons of war  the minimum levels of well-being required by the third world will be unattainable. If those expenditures were to be applied to the achievement of economic progress  the human condition would very soon improve.A short while ago we harboured hope because of an era of detente which  despite being based on a balance of the most lethal weapons  left considerable room for dialogue and the quest for more reasonable balances. Thus agreement seemed possible which could lead towards a slow- down of the arms race and to the control and reduction of a nuclear weapons. Now  however  the options for negotiations seem to be more restricted.Rearmament initiatives are taken which break the precarious balance and use up scientific and material resources  which are thus diverted from the cause of development. The primacy of the concept of military superiority is leading us to increased uncertainty  in which total annihilation seems probable. In the face of this threat  we the developing countries  along with many sectors of the population of the industrialized societies  maintain our political and moral demand that the nuclear Powers reach agreements as soon as possible leading gradually to general and complete disarmament.We speak out against the trade in conventional weapons  which stirs up conflicts and creates vicious circles of mutual dependency. We are concerned at the fact that countries with limited resources are investing an undue proportion of their national efforts to acquiring weapons and consolidating their military apparatus. The paradox is that  for the sake of supposed security  the international community is experiencing the greatest insecurity it has ever known.The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones is particularly relevant today. The Treaty of Tlatelolco is a Latin American experience which should be extended to other regions. Many peace-loving countries have expressed full support for such proposals and we hope they will be put into effect.To confine international relations in the strait- jacket of bipolar confrontation means subordinating the aspirations of the immense majority of States to the wishes of others. We  the developing countries  see this simplification as a lessening of our independence  and we strive for more diversified and democratic international coexistence.The equality of States under the law  self-determination and non-intervention are principles that cannot be abandoned and which imply rejection of the monopoly of power  the consolidation of spheres of influence and ideological intolerance. They constitute the best defence of our peoples' identity and sovereignty.Current international conflicts are further complicated by hegemonist antagonism and thus serve to sustain a form of cold war  which in its turn makes confrontations more dangerous. The position adopted by the Government of Mexico with regard to these conflicts is consistent because it is in keeping with a policy based on principle and not the interests of the moment.The question of the Malvinas Islands is topical and affects the very core of our Latin American vocation. We reiterate our recognition of Argentine sovereignty over those islands and urge the parties to begin negotiations as soon as possible on a just and lasting settlement of this dispute.The situation in the Middle East is a clear reflection of the present state of international relations. I reaffirm Mexico's belief that peace in that region presupposes the exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable rights including its right to self-determination and independence  as well as recognition of the rights of all States to live in peace within recognized boundaries.In Lebanon the situation has been exacerbated by an escalation of clashes between factions backed by outside forces. We speak out in favour of a genuinely national solution which would take into account the legitimate rights and interests of all the groups which make up that country. The fragmentation of Lebanon is becoming a living symbol of the deterioration of international coexistence and of the failure to respect the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.There is no need to repeat our rejection of the system of apartheid and our unswerving support for the cause of the self-determination of the people of Namibia  the full independence of the Territory and the inadmissibility of linking that right to any other condition. Mexico again insists on the fact that complicity with the Pretoria regime must cease and the relevant resolutions of the Organization must be complied with.We are deeply concerned by the conflicts affecting regional coexistence and peace in the world. We hope that countries involved in fratricidal warsâsuch as Iraq and Iranâwill make special efforts as soon as possible to find a means of equitable negotiation. Once again we call for respect for the independence and territorial integrity of States  particularly in areas adjacent to the territory of the super-Powers  where the bipolar concept of the world is reflected in the denial of the rights of individuals and peoples.The present tensions could leadâas  indeed  is already happeningâto tragic incidents as a result of which the increasing trend towards the violation of international law and a lack of trust among States could become more marked. Respect for the dignity of all countries is the basic norm of diplomacy and is fundamental to the Organization.In the brief summary of the development of the international society that we make each year there inevitably appear old problems and new conflicts. We must recognize this time that the exacerbation of confrontation between the most important poles in the East and the West lessened the possibilities of understanding between North and South and has led to a clear deterioration in multilateral relations.In the face of this situation Member States must react vigorously. We cannot relinquish our sovereign not to play an effective part in the formulation of international decisions that affect all of us.The peoples we represent here strongly demand a return to the primary political values that are the fruit of many centuries of civilization and culture and in which they have put their hope of survival and progress.By definition  history is a process of change. The development of man is characterized by the quest for new balances in keeping with the scientific and social advances of each age. We can tackle the challenges we are able to solve with our accumulated experience and the tools given us by progress.In overcoming each crisis there has always been the spur of political ethics which has been expressed in rational terms. In our time the options are very dear: either we adopt a process of detente and co-operation or we run the risk of final catastrophe.AH States must accept the urgent need to order their internal processes in accordance with the values we proclaim in international forums. We must also shoulder the responsibility for peaceful coexistence in our own region. Finally  we must fulfil the duty of just and independent international conduct. This is the constant commitment of Mexico  which it is my honour to reiterate here today. "
"89",4614,"MLI",38,1983,"ï»¿156.	 Twenty years ago  Africa rose above the emotion and tensions inherent in post-independence periods to present itself united to the rest of the world and thus to bring to the international community a message  the thrust of which was as potent as that of the Charter of the United Nations.157.	In this twentieth anniversary year since the creation of that great African assembly  the OAU  it is quite natural that at the opening of the thirty-eighth session of this Assembly the first words of the spokesman of the Republic of Mali should be in salute to this message of responsibility  this message of the unity of hearts and wills in the service of peace  at this time of extreme tension in the world.158.	This state of the world makes the peoples of the United Nations live in anxiety about the future. The overwhelming picture of this state was described by the many eminent heads of State and Government who have spoken in turn from this rostrum and who  in their wisdom  have preached their love for peace and indicated the best ways to give the world confidence again.159.	The dominant features of the present international crises they have dwelt on  far from having moderated since the thirty-seventh session  have rather become so accentuated that we are  unfortunately  perhaps without even realizing it  on the brink of the apocalypse. The Member States on whom the Charter has conferred special responsibility for the maintenance of peace remain locked in the search for fatal weapons; other States  unfortunately  are still involved in wars to which there is no end in sight. In some places anachronistic colonial domination persists in its demeaning and destructive effects. Almost everywhere the world is idle  the world is ill-nourished  the world is hungry. Another outburst of racism aids and abets the crime of apartheid.160.	Unless it reacts vehemently  the United Nations will remain in the restraint of a certain political fatalism in its approach to dangerous developments in those events that we analyse at each session with such impressive lucidity. Unfortunately  each time we find only ineffectual solutions  because some are accepted by general agreement but never implemented  while others remain tenuous because of the major reservations entered when they were adopted.161.	However  the drafters of the Charter dreamed of a grand world which would constantly improve in a healthy and inspiring competition to exalt the grandeur and dignity of man.162.	In our work of seeking viable solutions for distressing international problems  we welcome as an exceptional stroke of fortune for the international community the fact that the work of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly is being guided by a statesman of the calibre of Mr. Jorge Illueca. This sign of international approval is a tribute to the continuing action of his country  Panama  in working for peace. It is also a tribute to the efforts he personally has made throughout an outstanding career devoted to the defence of the lofty principles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the noble ideals of the Charter.163.	The heavy burden that an exceptional destiny has led him to assume will be made lighter by the fact that the Secretariat is guided by that other diplomat whose competence has been recognized by all  Mr. Javier P6rez de Cu611ar  citizen of a country neighbouring his which  like Panama  is a friend of my own country. After scarcely two years in office  the Secretary-General  thanks to his calm determination and his high-mindedness  has conferred fresh dynamism on the administration of the United Nations. We salute the courage and tenacity he has shown in calling upon the United Nations to be receptive to fresh ideas which can lead us finally to build this world where all nations  without exception  will redouble their concerted efforts to bring about a society of peace  built by peoples all of whom are free from all forms of domination  a society of progress built on the just satisfaction of the common aspirations of peoples and nations to well-being  freedom and security  and thus to peace.164.	Mr. Illueca's predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of the Hungarian People's Republic  worked throughout the thirty-seventh session with his customary ability for the triumph of the Organization's ideals and principles. We renew our heartfelt congratulations to that citizen of a country which is friendly with mine.163. The aim of the United Nations is to achieve universality. One glimmer of hope is that this dream of universality of the drafters of the Charter is inexorably becoming a reality. Thus the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly has had the pleasure of welcoming into its midst Saint Christopher and Nevis. On behalf of the people of Mali and its leaders  it is an honour for me to welcome the brother nation of this new State and to assure it of our firm intention of joining in fraternal cooperation in defending the principles and ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.166.	Although the Organization has been enriched by another fighter for the triumph of the right to freedom and national existence  nevertheless we must mention the persistence of colonial domination  and this almost forty years since the Charter was signed and almost a quarter of a century since the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Through its arrogance and excessive violence  this anachronistic colonial domination is without any doubt a challenge to the Charter  a challenge to the Organization  a challenge to the conscience of mankind and therefore a challenge that is unacceptable. This situation is one of the major causes of the increasing deterioration of the international climate. In order to preserve peace  all nations have the moral responsibility and the imperative duty to resist all attacks on the dignity of peoples and the free choice of their future. But unfortunately this fight that we must wage together is coming up against the selfish interests of the Organization's Member States  some of whom have a specific responsibility for the maintenance of peace.167.	That is why the Pretoria regime  which negates the elementary values of civilization  can continue with impunity to defy the international community by illegally occupying Namibia and by practising the heinous policy of168.	After the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) by unanimous vote  including the five great Powers  and the Pretoria regime's unreserved acceptance of the resolution  we had hoped that the Namibian question had finally been resolved. But we did not take into account either the customary arrogance of the racist regime or  especially  the attitude of certain States Members of the United Nations which unhesitatingly contradicted their noble ideals of justice and freedom by showing great understanding towards and even complicity with the illegal racist Power of Pretoria.169.	In order to delay Namibia's accession to independence  South Africa has constantly initiated plans  manoeuvres and evasive tactics to link that independence sometimes to the presence of Cuban troops in Angola  sometimes to the prior adoption of a sham electoral system  sometimes to the alleged partiality of this Organization. The establishment of a supposed security zone in southern Africa is the latest argument advanced by the Pretoria racists for installing a puppet council of State in Namibia.170.	Memories are not so short that we can forget that the People's Republic of Angola  shortly after it achieved independence  was invaded without any declaration of war by South Africa. First of all  Angola went to the United Nations to obtain a guarantee of its security  but without success  and that young Republic had no choice  other than self-destruction  but to exercise its natural right of legitimate defence  which is recognized and authorized by Article 51 of the Charter.171.	The plans  manoeuvres and evasive tactics of Pretoria are merely well-known delaying tactics  while South Africa is still with impunity occupying part of Angola by force and is pursuing its armed aggression against neighbouring independent  sovereign countries.172.	The true intentions of South Africa in linking Namibian independence with the prior establishment of a security zone in southern Africa are those same intentions as lead it to keep Namibia in perpetual subjection  to break the revolutionary spirit of the people of Azania and persuade the international community to give its approval to apartheid. Thus it is easy to understand why the proposals for a settlement of the Namibian question have remained a dead letter.173.	Therefore it is through the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) and the relevant annexes  which in and of themselves are sufficient  that we must make every effort to help SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  finally and in the very near future  to begin the construction of its country  returned to freedom in strict respect for its demographic homogeneity and territorial integrity.174.	Mali will continue to give its active support to the valiant people of Namibia so that final victory may be the just reward of its long martyrdom and further proof of the faith of the peoples still under colonial domination in the United Nations.175.	The freedom of peoples and respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States are sacred. Respect for human dignify is also sacred apartheid defies the solemn undertaking that we have given on behalf of the peoples of the United Nations to attain the noble objectives of the Charter. Thus the struggle against	of is becoming the struggle of all to preserve human dignity. It pits the Pretoria regime  the legatee of a racism which almost brought the world to its downfall  against our common determination to live in harmony and to enrich ourselves through our differences.176.	apartheid cannot be humanized; it is its nature to divide in order to strengthen repression. The recent attempts to break the unity of the South African nationalists in fact hide its vulnerability in the face of the increasing triumphs of the freedom fighters and of the growing condemnation by the world public. The international community strengthened its support for the cause of freedom by deciding on more concrete measures at the Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  held from 1 to 12 August 1983 at Geneva.177.	It is the duty of the international community  in particular the United Nations  to intensify its struggle against apartheid by isolating Pretoria totally. We must fight by every means availableâdiplomatic  political  economic and militaryâagainst a regime which maintains an anachronistic colonial system  a regime which practises an internal policy which is a disgrace to mankind  a regime which through its daily acts of aggression violates the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of its neighbours.178.	The provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter show the way and give the means to the Security Council  to which the Charter has given the primary task of maintaining international peace and security.179.	The right of peoples to freedom is universal and inalienable. It applies to the people of Azania  to the people of Namibia and to the Palestinian people. The struggle for national existence waged by the Palestinian people under the banner of the PLO goes beyond the context of Palestine. After four wars it continues to shake the Middle East; it carries the seeds of another international conflagration which could have fatal consequences. The question of Palestine  far from being an Arab-Israeli conflict  is in fact a conflict between an occupying Power and a people that rejects colonial domination. It was in the quest for a final  but impossible  victory against the valiant Palestinian fighters that the Golan Heights were occupied  that the nuclear facilities at Tammuz were bombed  that Lebanon was invaded and that a year ago the disgraceful massacres of Sabra and Shatila were perpetrated.180.	The proposals by Mali with the object of establishing peace in the Middle East  and reaffirmed by the head of State of Mali from this rostrum at the thirty-sixth session entirely relevant and valid.181.	The very pertinent conclusions of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983  and the Programme of Action for the Achievement of Palestinian Rights  offer all countries that cherish peace and justice new reasons for redoubling their efforts to ensure that the Palestinian people  under the guidance of the PLO  their sole legitimate representative  are able to exercise their inalienable rights  including the right to self-determination and independence.182.	Respect for the universal principles that underlie the basic right of peoples to self-determination must be seen by every Member State as a sacred duty. It is a duty fulfilled by my country  Mali  when it recognized and reaffirmed the inalienable right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination by means of an open and properly organized general referendum  which is the only way of resolving the serious crisis resulting from incomplete decolonization. Only the speedy conclusion of this process can help establish a just and definitive peace in that subregion of Africa  whose peoples  including my own  have through the ages been mutually enriched by their experiences  their culture and their philosophy of life. The question of Western Sahara must in no way impair the harmonious sharing of this common heritage.183.	The differences on this question  as is known  have caused a serious crisis within the OAU. The African heads of Stateâalthough I shall not detail the many individual and collective initiatives that have been takenâhave laid a solid foundation for a settlement of the question of Western Sahara. Indeed  at Addis Ababa  at its nineteenth session  the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity adopted a settlement plan [see	which calls for the cooperation of the United Nations.184.	Notwithstanding the difficulties that have now arisen concerning the implementation of that important and decisive resolution adopted at Addis Ababa  we pin our hopes on the actions and initiatives under way to find an African solution for the problem of the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.185.	Several years of warfare in the Western Sahara have shown that the solution to the question does not lie in military confrontation. History also teaches us that there has not been a single conflict or war that has not ended at the negotiating table. That is the price of peace in Western Sahara  a price that the parties to the conflict  POLISARIOs and the Kingdom of Morocco  must pay with honour and dignity.186.	It is because of its awareness of the interdependence of all peoples  particularly those living in the same area of civilization  that the people of Mali has made and will continue to make good-neighborliness a cardinal principle of its African policy. As has been repeatedly stated from this rostrum  Mali intends to consolidate that principle  which we see as the only way to guarantee the individual existence of all States.187.	That is why Mali continues to participate in the patient building of regional bodies which are demonstrating their mission of peace  solidarity  co-operation and friendship among brother peoples naturally united by a common history. 188.	To cite but a few examples of such organizations  the West African Economic Community  the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River  and the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel are effective instruments for the development of our subregion. On an even wider scale  faithful to the strategy set out by the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa  the Economic Community of West African States is now operating a large  reliable pool of experts and economic  cultural and social resources which could give a new dimension to the fruitful contribution of the African peoples to the very necessary dialogue among nations.189.	Those are the sole and profound reasons that have led the Governments of our subregion  mindful of the reality of their history and the age-old devotion to peace of their peoples  to conclude border agreements to strengthen  in tranquillity  their many links of co-operation and thus to participate in bringing a new order to the developing world  given the present deadlock in the North-South dialogue.190.	Such agreements have already been concluded between Niger and Algeria  and Algeria and Mali  and will soon be concluded between Mali and Mauritania  and Mali and Upper Volta. They attest to the fact that good faith and a sound and brotherly concept of the principle of good-neighborliness make possible the honest implementation of the OAU rule regarding the inviolability of the borders bequeathed by the colonial Power  and they remain the only basis on which to look beyond short- term issues and devote ourselves to the urgent tasks of development.191.	Only through the maintenance of positive dialogue and the spirit of good-neighborliness among the nations  and particularly those of the third world  can we move towards the realization of the great aspirations of the peoples of the United Nations.192.	That phenomenon  which is already notable in its immediate effects  is undoubtedly based on age-old virtues. Those virtues are embodied in the collective wisdom of nations and will triumph over the present obstacles and the conflicts and wars which unfortunately still divide brothers  destroy families and wipe out societies. At each historic turning-point the people have found the appropriate response to their preoccupations. That is why my delegation is convinced that now  too  Africans will be able to resolve the problems that have arisen in the continent.193.	The situation prevailing in Chad  which is of concern to the people of Mali and its leaders  has become more tense  despite the precarious lull of recent weeks.194.	Chad  a Sahel State and a founding member of the Organization of Saharan States  must be the primary beneficiary of the principles governing the charter of that young subregional organization. The sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Chad must be safeguarded. The national unity of the people of Chad must be preserved. If those two major objectives are to be achieved  all States Members of the United Nations must ensure that two essential conditions are fulfilled. First  there must be no external interference  whether from within or outside Africa. Secondly  and above all  it is only through national reconciliation that a lasting solution can be found to the crisis in Chad. Only the reconciliation of all the sons of Chad will make it possible to resolve the Chad aspect of the crisis. When the children of Chad are reconciled  the external aspect of the crisis will be more easily resolved  because in unity people have always found appropriate responses to attacks on their sovereignty and independence and territorial integrity.195.	We have already stated that only dialogue and a policy of good-neighborliness can lead to the achievement of the great aspirations of the people who have given us a mandate to guarantee their security and well-being. Unfortunately  those aspirations are still thwarted in Latin America and in the Caribbean.196.	Those third world countries this year commemorate the bicentennial of the birth of Simon Bolivar  one of their greatest historical figures for whom freedom  tolerance and unity were the indispensable foundations of the emancipation of the region. Africa  which appreciated the awarding of the Simon Bolivar Prize to Nelson Mandela  imprisoned for life in South African gaols  welcomes that great event.197.	The message of Contadora and the Manifesto to the Peoples of Latin America in the Declaration by the Presidents of the Bolivarian Republics adopted at Caracas in July 1983	clearly reflect the faith of Latin America in its unity and in its desire for co-operation in peace and with respect for the sovereignty of States. The Republic of Mali renews its support for them in the efforts to achieve those noble objectives which are so dear to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.198.	The seriousness of international disputes and their consequences require us to look for wise solutions. It is more than ever necessary for us to realize the futility of war as a means of resolving conflicts among nations.199.	My country is deeply concerned by the conflict between Iraq and Iran  two Muslim non-aligned countries both of which are friends of the people of Mali. The mediation efforts of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and by the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement have unfortunately not put an end to that war. The Republic of Mali  which has always supported any initiative aimed at the definitive solution of that painful problem  once again appeals urgently to the belligerent parties finally to heed the voice of reason and put an end to the hostilities  which threaten the stability of the region and jeopardize its development.200.	We hope that finally an atmosphere of peace  understanding and concord will be established among all the sons of Afghanistan. That proud and courageous people  which has a noble history  would gain much by laying down its arms  so that it could regain its unity and tackle its primary tasks of development.201.	With regard to Kampuchea  my country  which very much appreciates the age-old genius of the great peoples of the region  will associate itself fully with any action aiming at bringing about a political solution to the crisis.202.	The situation prevailing in Cyprus is also a matter of concern and continues to be a source of international tension. We encourage the two communities  Greek and Turkish  to continue along the path of negotiation and positive dialogue. For its part  Mali  which is a member of the contact group on Cyprus of the Non-Aligned Movement  will spare no effort to find a just and lasting solution to this conflict.203.	After more than two decades  we are still awaiting a solution to the splitting of Korea  which was artificially divided. The national feeling of the Korean people is profound and its thirst for unity is real. The seriousness of recent events in that part of the world requires that political ways and means be found for a peaceful reunification of the Korean homeland. 204.	The world is dominated by crises and confrontations which may lead humanity to its doom. These situations are taking on a terrifying dimension because of the strengthening of military alliances and the frenetic race for more and more sophisticated weapons. The serious risks of a nuclear conflagration are becoming more apparent every day. Thus  despite the declarations of principle and the best intentions  disarmament remains an empty word.205.	As the delegation of Mali emphasized at the thirty- fourth session: It is essential for us to continue to work together openly in order to make headway along the difficult road to general and complete disarmament  to the dismantling of all military bases forcibly stationed in third world countries and to the stopping and reversing of the arms race. It is only that type of co-operation that can lead to the creation of a more secure world where peace would depend less on weapons and would no longer be founded on the outmoded theory of a balance of terror and mutual destruction. 206.	Therefore  my delegation will continue to support any proposal leading to general and complete disarmament considered in all its aspects. It will continue to take an active part  with total open-mindedness  in any positive initiatives to reverse the arms race. Mali associates itself with any effort to strengthen the just positionsâjust because they are truly independent of ideological or military blocsâas expressed at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  at New Delhi in March 1983.207.	In the field of disarmament as in that of development  the true solutions to international problems must proceed from a comprehensive view of the world  in particular the primacy of our common future. This vision has been lacking and the world economy is beset by crisis.208.	In the face of this common peril  the attitude has been a negative one of self-defence and not a positive one of seeking collective security. Thus  further protectionist barriers have been erected to stave off the crisis. They have had the opposite effect since the crisis has worsened. Trade has shrunk and the monetary market is beyond our understanding.209.	In its 1983 World Development Report  the World Bank allows hope for a possible forthcoming recovery in certain economies of the developed market economy countries. To quote the document  this is a recovery  which is taking a long time to come   or  to use an expression used by the economic services of the United Nations   it is an elusive recovery .210.	This recovery is not' 'taking a long time to come''  nor is it an  elusive  recovery for the developing countries which continue to suffer the most restrictive effects of the world economic crisis: an unprecedented drop in real terms of commodity prices  a constant drop since 1970 in the average export earnings from manufactured goods of developing countries  and unprecedentedly high interest rates. This means a lessening of their ability to pay and thus to a blockage of development.211.	The world Economic Survey âthis time a United Nations publication âreaffirms this in these words:  In the developing countries considered as a group  production has failed to rise for the first time since the end of the war.  And the World Bank goes further than this:  Low-income countries in Africa  more dependent on the imports of commodities  have suffered much from the crisis. Their per capita income continues to be reduced  with the risk of being lower in the 1980s than it was in the 1960s. 212.	However  peace and development are interdependent  as was forcefully emphasized by the heads of State or Government of non-aligned countries at New Delhi. In the name of our abiding fundamental interest  the third world  particularly the non-aligned countries  for more than 20 yearsâthat is to say  at the very time when the economies of the developed countries were expandingâ has ceaselessly called for collective and broad thinking about the need to reorder our economies for their continuous harmonious expansion. Unfortunately  no satisfactory response has been given to this invitation.213.	Since 1964  on the initiative of the third world  the United Nations has been trying to fix a development target for international trade relations by setting up a more orderly and equitable world economic machinery. UNCTAD was given that mandate  and it has just concluded its sixth session  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  without even reaching agreements in principle on pressing issues  which are basic elements of the present economic crisis.214.	The enormous hopes aroused in 1979 by the invitation of the third world to embark on global negotiations on the establishment of a new international economic order are steadily receding. Indeed  after many long and irksome years of talks  with contacts very often at the highest level  negotiations are still at the procedural stage.215.	International development strategies and machinery conceived to make them effective have thus suffered setbacks because of the resistance of certain developed countries to a dynamic new approach to world problems of development and to the need to find advantageous solutions.216.	Because of insufficient resources  UNDP has been forced to reduce drastically the level of its involvement in the implementation of the programmes of the third programming cycle. It is useful to recall that these programmes were set up with special consideration for the greater vulnerability of the economies of many countries which are the beneficiaries of UNDP activities  in particular the least developed countries. Many United Nations funds exist in name only.217.	The developing countries  need I recall  are suffering tragically from the effects of the economic crisis. This blanket statement  however  conceals the even more untenable position of the least developed among them  particularly those suffering from especially difficult geographical and climatic conditions.218.	The drought which has afflicted the Sudano-Sahelian region for 14 years has continued and is steadily worsening. The national efforts made by the courageous peoples of the Sahel to assure their self-sufficiency in food and their effective participation in the international economy have been severely handicapped by the present unfair market laws. The countries affected by the drought have often drawn the attention of the international community to the grave danger of gradual desertification to their survival.219.	That is why Mali firmly supports the idea launched by ECA to organize an international scientific round table on problems relating to climatic changes in Africa and on the disastrous effects of drought  erosion  cyclones and hunger on African peoples.220.	However  it is encouraging to note that the economic difficulties of the least developed countries  particularly those in the Sudano-Sahelian region  fortunately have not left the rest of the world completely indifferent. To improve their state of developmentâthat is to say  to achieve the minimum economic growth targets that they set in close co-operation with the rest of the international communityâthe United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris in September 1981  recognized that these targets  incorporated in a substantial new programme for development  would have a chance of being implemented only if these countries were to receive a significant increase in official development assistance during the present decade. The resolutions of the General Assembly concerning the least developed countries come to the same conclusions.221.	Since that time  round tables held on the welcome initiative of UNDP have enabled several of the least developed countries to engage in appropriate forms of frank and constructive dialogue with donor countries to facilitate the execution of their development programmes.222.	Our country has had the opportunity to appreciate the benefits of international solidarity  and we hope for the continuation of this active commitment by the developed countries  the international agencies and the financial institutions  particularly the Bretton Woods institutions.223.	Given the critical situation in the world  we must regain our self-control. We must restore to the United Nations its full capacity to act to eliminate hotbeds of war  to avoid new crises and to seek genuine solutions for the world economic crisis. The proposals made some time ago by the Non-Aligned Movement concerning the effectiveness of the United Nations system have consequently now become particularly relevant and important. In precise  measured and balanced language  the Movement's Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government called upon the international community to honour its commitment to peace.224.	In the field of disarmament  we must guarantee survival and coexistence in this nuclear age.225.	In the field of economic development we are calling for nothing more or less than collective action for world prosperity.226.	It would be a great source of satisfaction to the people of Mali to work for the triumph of the noble ideals of the Charter  especially for the restoration of international security and stability  particularly at the regional and subregional levels. This would be a great source of encouragement for the people of Mali  who are traditionally devoted to peace  to the reconciliation of hearts and minds and to the strengthening of friendly and fruitful relations among all peoples.227.	These objectives form part of the abiding concerns of the people of Mali  and that is why in October 1981 the head of State of Mali  President Moussa Traore  reaffirmed from this very rostrum the constructive commitment of our country  which is located in the geopolitical heart of the West African savannah  to dialogue: dialogue among nations; dialogue of history with history; dialogue among differing civilizations; dialogue among men of all beliefs.228.	At this time  when the peace is being breached throughout the world  when hunger and poverty are on the rise  when the mad race to acquire the instruments of the apocalypse continues  the need to ensure the collective security of the world takes on a vital urgency.229.	The Republic of Mali calls on the members of the Assembly to join in this noble endeavour."
"90",4655,"MLT",38,1983,"ï»¿94.	 Please accept my congratulations  Sir  on your election as President of this session. You merit our full co-operation  not only in your capacity as a representative of Panama  but also by virtue of your experience of Assembly affairs  your country's contribution to the peace of Central America as a member of the Contadora Group and  last but not least  your inspiration as a true son of the ideals of Simon Bolivar  on this the 200th anniversary of the Liberator's birth.95.	We take this opportunity to compliment the Deputy Foreign Minister of Hungary  Imre Hollai  for his tireless efforts in presiding over last year's session.96.	We welcome the new addition to our membership by the admission of Saint Christopher and Nevis. We offer our congratulations on its independence and we extend our best wishes for the peace and prosperity of its people.97.	The system of co-operation and mutual understanding originally envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations is increasingly being threatened by the cynical use of military predominance in inter-State relations. We have to ask ourselves whether this unrestrained scramble for global power and complete influence over men and resources is leading us irresistibly to the 1984 nightmare evoked by Orwell  which would engulf State sovereignty as we know it  or can we as independent nation-States still achieve our freedom and self-respect in peace and harmony?98.	The signs are far from encouraging. In Latin America a number of peoples  in particular in El Salvador and Chile  continue to be suppressed as the/ demand their basic human rights. Others who have achieved these rights through bitter struggle  as in Nicaragua  are faced with resolute opposition from outside.99.	In Asia there persists the shameful presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. The peaceful reunification of Korea is still thwarted by the imperatives of foreign interests. Two neighbouring countries  Iran and Iraq  remain locked in a festering conflict.100.	The Palestinian people are still engaged in their bitter struggle to secure a homeland. Attempts at national reconciliation in Lebanon are wrecked by the contending pressures of divergent outside interests.101.	In Africa the peoples of Namibia and South Africa still await their liberation from the imposition of racist and immoral bondage.102.	In our own region of the Mediterranean we remain the helpless witnesses of the continuing violation of the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of the sister island of Cyprus. We live under the constant threat of massive armadas scouring our sea and using our region as a base from which to project their influence to neighbouring countries.103.	In the light of these realities the policies adopted by Malta's socialist Government since 1971 have been inspired so far by our yearning for a community of nations pursuing their individual destinies in peace and co-operation. Yet we cannot ignore the fact that dangerous  radical and even costly choices could be forced upon us in view of the growing number of fellow nations and peoples caught in the vortex of events which threatens to engulf us all.104.	It is therefore necessary to take stock of Malta's achievements and prospects in the military  political and economic fields.105.	In the military Held we confront an irrational situation in which a frenetic production and deployment of monstrous armaments is defined as the best safeguard of peace. It is this attitude which has exposed the Mediterranean to the escalating naval confrontation of the two armed alliances.106.	Until 1971 Malta was enmeshed in this confrontation by virtue of the military bases it was obliged to offer NATO. However  from 1964  as soon as Malta was no longer constitutionally a British colony and therefore not considered part of United Kingdom territory  it lost all the protective defence guarantees deriving from the collective security arrangements of the Washington treaty.107.	This situation only increased the attraction of the military bases as a prime target in any eventual hostilities and therefore unashamedly exposed the Maltese to much greater dangers than those tolerable even in any NATO member country. If left unchecked  NATO would have by now been contemplating the deployment of nuclear missiles in Malta. Our unprotected citizens would therefore have become further exposed to the hazards of accidents in time of peace  as well as to the assured destruction by pre-emptive strikes in time of hostilities.108.	It took the workers' movement in Malta to recognize the insanity of such policies and put a stop to them. The options we have exercised since 1971  leading to the closing down of the military bases in 1979 and the ensuing denial of military facilities  eliminated from Malta that military connection which was absurdly jeopardizing our freedom and safety.109.	We have seen the beneficial effects of our choices for peace.110.	  Our close neighbour Libya was among the foremost to recognize the significance of our decision to remove all military bases from our territory for the security of the Mediterranean. It was the first to give us both moral and material assistance to enable us to overcome the violent opposition we faced in the initial stages.111.	From a distant region  China also understood very early the important contribution Malta was making towards a peaceful and co-operative global environment for which it was also striving. China has been a consistent and solid friend of Malta ever since  and the Maltese people deeply appreciate this.112.	Many countries have today recognized and expressed support for our status of neutrality  both at the bilateral level and in the multilateral forums of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Commonwealth and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.113.	The options which our workers' movement has exercised for peace and co-operation have so far ensured the greater freedom of the Maltese people and their growing respect within the community of nations. However  in a world experiencing an increasing threat to the institutions of peace  we have to remain extremely vigilant. The options we take in the future have to be conditioned by the realities with which we are faced.114.	At the political level Malta exercised its options for peace by adopting a status of neutrality based on the principles of non-alignment  by maintaining equal distance from the super-Powers and by promoting cooperation and security in the Mediterranean. Over the past years these policies found their principal expression in the Non-Aligned Movement  in the Security Council and in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.115.	At New Delhi  in March of this year  Malta joined the non-aligned countries in reaffirming the commitment to the pursuit of peaceful intercourse among nations  the rejection of arms build-up as a basis for security  the desire to avoid the entanglements of bloc alliances  the demand that all peoples be permitted to seek their prosperity in free and sovereign nationhood  and the call for vastly increased global economic co-operation to relieve the misery  hunger and suffering which still cast a dark shadow in the closing twentieth century.116.	Malta steadfastly joins in the pursuit of these objectives because it sees in their implementation the most effective safeguard of the political and economic freedom which it has progressively achieved over the few years since eliminating all unwanted foreign military  political and economic influence from its territory.117.	At New Delhi the non-aligned countries formally expressed their recognition and support of the status of neutrality adopted by Malta in pursuance of its objective to entrench the process of its national development within a larger process of regional security and co-operation in the Mediterranean	an. In the same spirit the New Delhi meeting welcomed Malta's initiatives on Mediterranean security undertaken within the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and agreed to call a meeting of all Mediterranean non- aligned countries to consider what further action should be taken to consolidate Mediterranean security and co-operation.118.	We cannot forget that it is through the support of the Non-Aligned Movement that Malta finally was given its first opportunity to serve as a member of the Security Council. All cur actions in the Council have been inspired by the firm appreciation of its unique role in the pursuit of international peace and security. We have in this way further manifested the active concept of our neutral status. Malta's is not a passive neutrality intent on shying away from a commitment to international obligations.Neither is it a neutrality inhibited by any purist notions which impose a deliberate avoidance of the super-Powers. On the contrary  by evolving a policy of equal distance we have established a mature relationship with both super-Powers which permits us to fulfil the role we have assumed in the quest for peace and co-operation in our region  as well as in bringing about a co-operative and positive attitude towards the resolution of international problems.119.	Over the past nine months there have arisen in the Security Council frequent occasions calling for our endeavours to promote international peace and security.120.	The situation in Central America  in particular the threat to the sovereignty and freedom of the Nicaraguan people  has figured prominently in Council discussions. Malta's position on this issue has been inspired by two basic objectives: safeguarding the hard-won rights of the Nicaraguan people  and accepting the role of States in shaping the destiny of their own region. We consulted intensively with the Nicaraguan representatives  as well as with  on the one hand  the members of the Contadora GroupâVenezuela  Mexico  Panama and Colombiaâ and  on the other hand  the permanent members of the Security Council  particularly the United States  to identify the most appropriate Council action on this problem. This resulted in the delicately balanced resolution 530 (1983)  unanimously adopted  which reaffirmed the right of Nicaragua to live in peace and security  free from outside interference  and gave support to the continuing work of the Contadora Group.121.	Our own region of the Mediterranean has had more than its fair share of problems over the course of this year. The Council has had to deal with a dangerous confrontation between Libya and the United States  with mutual complaints from Chad and Libya against each other  with the international implications of a civil war in Chad and with the even more awesome international implications of the problems of Lebanon. On each occasion Malta sought to steer discussion in the Council to the essential aspects of the issues at stake  the need to avoid interference in the internal affairs of States  respect for human lives  the avoidance of super-Power involvement in regional issues  and the primacy of regional States in defining solutions for problems of their own region.122.	The solutions Malta has sought for these problems are not based on any intention or desire to assign blame or condemnation but rather on the need to identify  through quiet and patient diplomacy  pragmatic steps towards the relaxation of tension. In this context we are satisfied that our role in the Council discussions on Chad has helped towards the adoption by consensus of a President's statement which continued adequately to cover subsequent developments by urging co-operation rather than exacerbating tension.123.	Similarly  in the recent case of the Korean Air Lines incident  our first and dominant concern was to work to ensure not so much that a culprit be identified but that a collective undertaking be secured to guarantee that no similar incident will ever happen. We voted for the draft resolution eventually submitted in the Council after we were satisfied that there existed a sufficient commitment to work within ICAO to reinforce the international rules and regulations aimed at avoiding such incidents  particularly by ensuring that in cases of accidental violations of airspace the over flying aircraft would be given due warning  safe landing would be provided and all the countries concerned would be involved in any necessary discussions.124.	Unfortunately  there are instances when direct accusation cannot be avoided simply because the violation of the basic norms of international behaviour is so persistent and blatant. Such is indeed the case of Israel's policies concerning the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a homeland of their own. Malta will continue unequivocally to condemn Israel as long as its present policies are maintained  and our support for the Palestinian struggle  under the leadership of the PLO  remains unchanged.125.	Similarly  in the case of Namibia and South Africa  we cannot but continue to voice our horror and disgust at the aggressive and immoral manner in which a small and recalcitrant racist minority continues to defy the most basic norms of human behaviour. Within the very modest means at our disposal  we are giving assistance to the Namibian people in their continuing struggle. As Malta had helped in the educational and technical training of Zimbabwean students before their country's independence  we are now offering similar opportunities to Namibian students.126.	At the same time  in the Council we also worked actively for a unanimously adopted resolution on Namibia  which involved very intensive and delicate negotiations. That resolution [332	mandated the Secretary-General to undertake consultations with all the parties involved  and we trust that the basis thus established will be pursued assiduously by all so that the Namibian people will finally achieve their long-awaited independence.127.	The confidence that we have inspired through our approach in the Security Council has been such as to encourage members to entrust us with the complex and time-consuming task of identifying points of convergence in efforts to enhance the Council's effectiveness in fulfilling its role for peace. We shall pursue the efforts we have undertaken over the past months and which by September had already resulted in a note by the President outlining a lumber of points on which progress could be achieved.128.	Malta sees the Security Council not only as the body which deals with issues once they reach crisis point  but also as having an important role in laying down the more durable foundations for the improvement of the international environment through effective action which  for example  facilitates the creation of zones of peace in regions like the Mediterranean  the Indian Ocean and elsewhere.129.	Over the past three years  in the Madrid follow- up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  Malta has been engaged in another forum where it has sought to consolidate the basis of its own national freedom through the enhancement of the process of regional and global security and co-operation.130.	In 1975  in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe at Helsinki  meeting for the first time since the Second World War  all European States except Albania  together with the United States and Canada  agreed on a broad set of measures aimed at ensuring European security and co-operation. At Madrid  Malta's basic position was that the arrangements being worked out for security in Europe should be reflected in analogous arrangements regarding the Mediterranean region. The tremendous resistance to Malta's position at Madrid showed unmistakably the clear intention of some participants to reject the commitments they had undertaken at Helsinki regarding security in the Mediterranean. This Malta could never accept.131.	By late July of this year Malta had made it clear that  after waiting through two and a half years of bickering and confrontation at Madrid over an extended range of East-West issues  we would not be forced into a hasty approval of a final document which failed to reflect the Mediterranean dimension of the Conference. Nor would we agree to a proposal that the meeting should simply register a lack of agreement on Malta's position. At that point it was only Romania which stood by Malta to ensure that the consensus procedures of the Conference would continue to be respected.132.	Those who were seeking to orchestrate our apparent isolation at Madrid started to lose ground by the middle of August. Following an approach by Finland on behalf of the Nordic countries  the Prime Minister of Malta was in a position to indicate to President Reagan and President Andropov that a proposal had emerged which  while safeguarding Malta's legitimate Mediterranean concerns  also indicated our clear willingness to reach a solution acceptable to all. A number of participants  including Greece and Italy  expressed their readiness to accept that proposal  while at the same time clearly explaining to us the formidable pressure being put upon them to maintain an intransigent position.133.	That Mediterranean countries supported Malta's stand was to be expected. What was surprising was the hesitation and delay that the Soviet Union showed in coming round  as it eventually did in mid-August  to supporting this proposal aimed at enhancing the process of Mediterranean security and co-operation. After all  the late President Brezhnev himself had clearly enunciated on a number of occasions those steps to which the Soviet Union was committed in seeking to transform the Mediterranean into a zone of peace  in particular the extension of confidence-building measures to the Mediterranean  a co-ordinated reduction of armed forces in the region  the withdrawal of nuclear ships from the Mediterranean and an undertaking by nuclear Powers not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear Mediterranean States.134.	At Madrid  Malta was also fortified by the large measure of support which it was receiving from countries outside the Conference. China firmly gave us this support  and the League of Arab States  in a public declaration made during the last week of August  expressed its strong interest in the Conference proceedings and its whole-hearted support for Malta's proposals regarding Mediterranean security. We are deeply conscious of the positive impact which this support had on developments at Madrid.135.	Indeed  by the beginning of September our persistence had prevailed and  with the assistance of the neutral and non-aligned participants in the Conference  a commitment was obtained from all participants that there would be continuing support by the Conference for further initiatives to strengthen security and co-operation in the Mediterranean region. A last-minute attempt by the United States to make this support conditional upon restricting all such initiatives to Conference procedures was swept away at the eleventh hour.136.	The significance of the resulting agreements is that they create the essential conditions to ensure that issues of Mediterranean security and co-operation will be taken up in at least three follow-up activities.137.	There is  first of all  the Conference on Security- and Confidence-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  which is to start work at Stockholm in January 1984 and preparations for which will commence in Helsinki later this month. That Conference will bring together all European States and the super-Powers themselves to discuss confidence-building measures and disarmament not only in northern and central Europe but also in the Mediterranean. 138.	In the second place  there will be a seminar on Mediterranean co-operation at Venice next year  as a follow-up to the first meeting on Mediterranean cooperation in the economic  scientific and cultural fields  held in 1979 at Valetta.139.	In the third place  the results of the various ad hoc meetings and the initiatives  on Mediterranean security which Malta and other States concerned will take during the next three years  in conformity with the final agreement in Madrid  will be taken up at the next Conference follow-up meeting  at Vienna in 1986.140.	It is also significant that at the Madrid meeting the two super-Powers and their respective allies not only accepted Malta's declaration of neutrality as a contribution to security and co-operation in the Mediterranean but also urged other States to respect this neutrality.141.	At this session of the General Assembly Malta intends to take further steps towards Mediterranean security  for which we expect the support of  among others  all States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Assembly is already on record as calling for the transformation of the Mediterranean into a zone of peace. We expect that this year this call will find a clearer and more detailed formulation and will also be accompanied by agreement on practical steps to bring about this transformation.142.	In this way we will be consolidating a process which will enable the Stockholm Conference to tackle issues of Mediterranean security in a meaningful manner. This process will also be enhanced by the planned meeting of Mediterranean non-aligned States  as called for in the New Delhi Declaration.143.	Indeed  we have to look closely and carefully at the factors leading to the sharpening of tension in the Mediterranean if our options for peace in the region are to remain viable. The massive naval concentration in our sea  for example  is premised upon too absolute an application of the principles of the freedom of the high seas. Both the theory and practice of international law today already place growing constraints upon this principle so as to make it more consonant with the economic needs of the coastal States. In a closed sea like the Mediterranean  does there not strive a point beyond which the legitimate interests of coastal States make an absolute application of the principle of the freedom of the high seas no longer tolerable as a basis for justifying the massive naval and nuclear build-up by the superpowers which we are experiencing? Are not the commitments undertaken in the Helsinki Final Act themselves a pointer to a growing need for restraint of action where such restraint is necessary for the enhancement of regional security and co-operation?144.	It is therefore evident that the actions we are taking at the political level in asserting our national freedom and sovereignty bring us ever closer to a sharp choice between the options based on co-operation and mutual respect and those which are premised on the unrestrained and selfish grasp for power. As long as the avenues for co-operation remain open  Malta remains determined to utilize them. Increasingly  however  we also have to consider the alternatives which may present themselves if all other action fails.145.	Nowhere is this dilemma more acute than in the economic field. For its part  Malta has sought to ensure that its political assertion of its newly won freedom would itself galvanize and give new dimensions to our endeavour to ensure the economic viability of our people  which will in turn enable them to fulfil their political role for peace.146.	We have found this possible in two related aspects. At the internal level the removal from our midst of an oppressive foreign presence  together with the consequent weakening of the local reactionary forces nourished by that presence  suddenly released a tremendous potential for action. The main pillars of our economic infrastructure finally came under Maltese control. Transport and communications  insurance and banking and the means of information and education could therefore be used for the direct benefit of Malta's economic development.147.	Perhaps the most visible manifestation of this development lies in the major infrastructural transformation we have produced in our Grand Harbour over the last few years. The Grand Harbour of Valetta is justly renowned for natural endowments perhaps unique in the whole of the Mediterranean. Its long coastline  sheltered inlets  deep berthing and strategic location were  however  for centuries exploited only by foreign occupying Powers to bolster their naval supremacy in the region.148.	This has now all been changed. Whereas less than two decades ago the harbour was exclusively devoted to servicing warships  today it has major civil ship-repairing and ship-building facilities and is the centre of a growing trans-shipment trade and the venue of increasing maritime tourist activity.149.	Over a short period of phenomenal capital investment  we have constructed new and modem dry-docks and shipyards  opened up major container and berthing facilities  converted old port installations into large and modern ones and are in the process of completing grain- storage facilities equipped to handle over 80 000 tons of grain.150.	These infrastructural developments  which have permitted us to become a major servicing centre for our region  have also necessitated the development of a whole new harbour in Marsaxlokk  on the south-east coast of the island. This is now in an advanced stage of construction and when completed will greatly enlarge Malta's trans-shipment and related potential for the Mediterranean region.151.	I regret to have to reiterate a point I already made at the they-seventh session  namely  that some of the benefits of these projects are being jeopardized by the presence of remnants of war in our harbours and territorial waters. There is  furthermore  good evidence that Britain's continuing arrogant and unco-operative attitude on the question of the removal of bombs and wrecks from our harbour offers yet further evidence that the counsels of those opposed to Malta still prevail in British official circles. This explains why  in spite of Malta's friends in Britain  the potential for an improved relationship between the two countries continues to be frustrated by the lack of adequate responses by Britain on a Govemment-to-Govemment basis. How else can one interpret the leading role Britain has arrogated to itself to stifle Malta's special relationship with the European Economic Community [EEC] by obstructing recommendations already submitted by the EEC Commission  recommendations endorsed by the British member of the Commission himself? This opposition is all the more suspect in its motivation as it is based on irrelevant considerations such as the relating of assistance to gross national product per capita  which Britain has already thought to waive in respect of other Mediterranean countries.152.	It is in selfish and short-sighted ways such as these that nations seek to close the options for co-operation and peace for which the majority of people on our globe fervently hope. 132. Yet in another equally important respect  the political freedom of action based on its status of neutrality helps Malta overcome these problems and enlarge its freedom of manoeuvre  even in the economic Held. Progressively we have widened the range of our trading and other economic relationships to include most countries  developed and developing alike  from our region and beyond.153.	Those countries which are interested  for their own political reasons  in reinforcing the basis for Malta's neutrality seek to ensure that their expressions of political support be complemented by concrete measures of economic co-operation. Such measures would in turn ensure that no single country or group of countries could exert such a dominating influence through economic involvement as to render Malta's neutrality unstable. For its part  in developing ever closer economic relations with a country or group of countries  Malta is resolved not to permit one set of relations to preclude another se ; of equally close relations. It is these two principles which inspire Malta to seek a balance in its concurrent approaches with  on the one hand  the EEC and the emerging markets of the Gulf and the Maghreb and  on the other hand  the two super-Powers.154.	With the EEC Malta has long-established economic links which it is seeking to improve. We have found a considerable understanding from our European partners of the need for corresponding economic and financial measures of support for our status of neutrality  in exchange for our guarantee that Malta would not be used as a base for aggression against any EEC member State.155.	There is also a growing understanding that the need to ensure that the special relationship Malta is to establish with the Community  which will be different from full membership  and the concomitant obligation to apply politically inspired economic sanctions entangling us unnecessarily with an economic group against a third country or group of countries would not preclude us from pursuing equally close  though not exclusive  special relationships with other economic groups.156.	In fact  we have already forged close ties with our neighbours in North Africa  especially Libya and Algeria  which are participating actively with us  through joint ventures and in other forms  in various industrial projects  including the construction of an iron foundry  the development of manufacturing enterprises and the building of tourist complexes. Our friends from the Gulf  particularly the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates  assist us through grants and loans on conditions which are genuinely adapted to our small and fragile economic and financial potential. This assistance enables a more rapid development of the new port at Marsaxlokk  the grain silo and the Marsa shipbuilding yard  among other projects. We are in this way putting into pace the foundation for a special relationship with the Maghreb  as well as with Gulf countries  which  we are assured  will permit us at the appropriate time to gain preferential access to their markets once these are more closely consolidated.157.	Our policy of equal distance from the superpowers has an economic dimension as much as a political dimension. The super-Powers today are convinced that our actions in the Security Council  the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Non- Aligned Movement  among other bodies  constitute an unequivocal manifestation of our staunch adherence to the policy of equal distance in the political sphere. Malta is resolved to maintain this policy  while fully conscious of the limitations which deny infallibility to even the best among us.158.	Similarly  in the economic sphere  Malta is not seeking to offer one super-Power any advantage over the other but is simply seeking to develop its economic relations with both of them to the greatest possible extent.159.	From the United States of America we have had repeated expressions of political good will. These have yet to be translated into concrete projects of economic co-operation.160.	From the Soviet Union we have had a more formal commitment  entered into on signing the neutrality agreement  that it will develop commercial and economic relations with us in such a way as to reflect its support of our neutrality. Yet  the results of this commitment have so far been disappointing. This tends to confirm the sense that  overall  this agreement is virtually not working  thereby raising doubts as to how much good faith there was behind it in the first place.161.	In contrast  our relations with the People's Republic of China are producing many tangible results of mutual benefit to our two countries. Without even the necessity of formal assurances of friendship  in April this year  Madame Chen Muhua  Minister for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade of China  visited Malta and reached agreements with us on co-operation in the industrial  commercial  tourism  health and ship-building sectors.162.	Forging mutually beneficial relationships with other countries is  in our view  a long-term strategy aimed at consolidating our economic freedom on the basis of co-operation and mutual respect. During a time of almost endemic international economic recession such as we are experiencing  more immediate action is also required. Even in this specific context we have found that the long- term relationships we are building with other countries permit the introduction of various measures which also have remedial aspects  among which reciprocal trading agreements have proved to be most beneficial.163.	These arrangements not only help to maintain our flow of trade at a time of shrinking international commercial activity  but also have the longer-term effect of enlarging our potential export markets  as well as creating a useful mechanism to help balance our trade with partners with which we traditionally have large deficits. Over the last two years Malta has entered into reciprocal trading arrangements with Iraq  Turkey  Libya  Poland  Romania  Albania and Italy  and even more recently with multinational corporations which  in return for the major purchases we make from them  undertake to purchase products manufactured in Malta.164.	We are satisfied that in this way we can give expression to our national aspirations to freedom and progress by making choices based upon co-operation with other peoples. It is unfortunate that such an approach is not always possible. In contrast to the great good will which we have found elsewhere  the uncooperative attitudes and policies we are experiencing in our relations with Japan have been nothing less than disgusting. It is for this reason that  after our trade with that country had accumulated a deficit of over $100 million within a few years  and in the light of its obstinate refusal to take any remedial action  we stopped all our imports from Japan.165.	The Japanese response continues to be extremely negative. Their proposals for compensation to date have been so minimal that they do not even constitute a basis for useful discussions  much less offer a justification for lifting our ban on their exports. The selfish manner in which/the Japanese pursue their trading policies places serious obstacles in the path of international economic co-operation. It should come as no surprise  therefore  that Malta has taken the action which it has considered necessary and that  within a short time  other countries too will have to do likewise.166.	As a developing country  Malta is highly sensitive to the need for the establishment of a new international economic order. Though our individual problems differ tremendously in nature and degree  all of us in the developing world share a common disadvantage: our economies  for one reason or another  are especially exposed to pressures and influences from outside. For Malta  this exposure is the result of the very small size of our island economy and our lack of exploitable natural resources. In this context  the criteria  based on gross national product per capita and the quantum of foreign exchange reserves  applied by international institutions for their development assistance are completely inapplicable to Malta. In an economy of our size  the more relevant factors are such aspects as the disproportionate onus on the total economy of even the most minimal of infrastructural projects and the absolute need for liquid reserves in the absence of any significant indigenous productive or natural resources capacity.167.	In our view  the irrelevance of development assistance criteria constitutes one aspect of the insensitivity of the international economic system to real needs of development  which affect us more particularly because of our status as a developing island country. Other aspects of the inequitable international system  especially those relating to trade  transfer of technology  and money and finance  affect us in equal measure  as they do most other developing countries.168.	It is yet another expression of our desire to seek the options based on co-operation and understanding that we join other developing countries in calling upon the industrialized countries to respond to our call for major structural reforms in the international economic system  in particular by agreeing to launching global negotiations and convening an international conference on money and finance. The fragile edifice of our present international system is indeed most shaky in its economic foundations. If Orwell's nightmare were to take shape  its roots would probably lie in the debris of a bankrupt and stagnant world economy.169.	In Malta  it is thanks to the painstaking efforts of the workers' movement that our people today appreciate the different options in the road to their development. It has been the workers' movement which has defined and worked for peace and co-operation at the military  political and economic levels: our elimination of all military entanglements  our adoption of a status of neutrality based on the principles of non-alignment  and our expanding relations with so many different countries.170.	The methods of aggression can only frustrate these peaceful choices. While our deep commitment remains to pursue these choices  our ability to do so depends to a large measure upon the international political and economic environment which prevails and for which the individual actions of all of us are ultimately responsible171.	The workers' movement lit the torch of freedom and peace in Malta  where it now burns brightly. The socialist Government of Malta seeks to project this beacon for peace throughout the Mediterranean.

"91",4701,"MMR",38,1983,"ï»¿258.	  Sir  the delegation ofBurma  which I have the privilege to lead here  is happyto extend the warmest congratulations to the President of the thirty-eighth session. His distinguishes political career and Ms wide knowledge andexperience of world affairs is a guarantee to us ail thatthe present session is in the most abide hands. We wishto assure him of our support and co-operation in thedischarge of his responsibilities.259.	We also take this opportunity to render a tributeto the outgoing President  Mr. Imre Hollai  for theintegrity of purpose with which he guided the deliberations of the Assembly during the last session.260.	We are also happy to offer our felicitations andfriendly greetings to the delegation of Saint Christopherand Nevis on the occasion of its admission into the familyof the United Nations  which is yet another step towardsthe universality of the membership of the Organization.261.	The regular sessions of the General Assembly havealways been of great interest and value to all delegationspresent at these yearly gatherings. t is a traditional timeto review and evaluate what is happening in the world what we expect to do about it and to give thought to theproblems of the future. These occasions enable us to takestock of various standpoints in the present conditions ofthe world and to acquaint ourselves with each other'spositions and attitudes. For our part  we leave with anunderstanding and appreciation much better than whenwe Hurst come here.262.	For the past several years  the Assembly has beenworking under conditions of marked international tension. In our view  the pattern of events since our lastsession has shown no improvement or significant changesin the overall international situation  is it political  economic or social? as a world dominated by the politicaland strategic interests of the great Powers  their adverserelationship continues to encumber international relationsand impinge on the work of the Assembly. Unless theserelations are improved we fear that the present trend canonly lead to paralytic and consequent deviate in authority and power of the United Nationpredicament in which the world Organisation Rods itselfwith.263.	it is evident that great-Power relationships continue to dominate the present decade  with profoundimplications for peace and security. Their mutual mistrustand divergent views have so far been the main oust leto resolving the key issues of our times. Experience hasshown that a certain degree of understanding among thegreat Powers is essential before we can hope to gaintangible ground in the peace-making process. The courseof any negotiations can be circumscribed by their indifference or greatly enhanced by their support  if the UnitedNations is to take a constructive move towards a saferand more secure world  it is essential that the great Powersdo their part in making progress possible. Reorientationof thinking and formulation of new approaches andconcepts of solution will be possible only at a lower levelof tendon  In view of the exceptional responsibility witchthe great Powers bear in the questions of peace andsecurity  it is incumbent on them to come forth withinitiatives that would ensure reduction of internationaltensions. This also means that their present antagonismmust give way to a greater degree of coexistence thatwould reduce suspicion  build mutual confidence andcontribute to a more state and reliable world order.264.	The stability we seek requires continued efforts toplace international relations on sounder foundationsrather titan on a balance of material forces. We believethose permanent foundations for world peace on the basisof peaceful coexistence best respond to the hopes andaspirations of mankind and command the support of theoverwhelming majority of nations. We come from different continents with diverse historical  cultural andsocial backgrounds and differing political and economicconditions  all of which have their own validity. Moreover  human nature is much too diverse to allow for theimposition of an all-encompassing world system. Nosingle Power or group of Powers can expect to shape theworld's destiny m its own way. indeed  such an attemptwould only accentuate disharmony rather than promoteharmony and would fore nations apart rather than bringthem together.265.	in these circumstances  logic and reason dictatethat there is no alternative to a policy of peaceful coexistence and co-operation among States  whether big orsmelt  and irrespective of their political  economic andsocial systems. Let us recognize that it is in the Charterof the United Nations.266.	The factor of great-Power rivalry is but one sourceof world tension and conflict. The fact is that we live inan epoch of revolutionary changes which are fundamentalin nature. They have generated impulses and problemswhich are unprecedented in character and dimensions?In this situation  a deeper source of tension is the conflictbetween new incipient forces advancing to the forefrontand age-old forces holding on to domination. Within thischanging context  the full depth of the contemporarycrisis ranges from issues of disarmament to internationaleconomic processes. It is also reflected in the problemsof the Middle East  southern Africa  the situation inAfghanistan  Kampuchea and central America.267.	Having touched upon the general nature of worldissues  I should now like to comment briefly on them asthey relate to our common search for a viable and effective response.268.	Negotiations on disarmament and arms control are encountering many contradictions and difficult.The world community is still burdened by the chronicproblem of the armaments race  whoâs undiminishedtempo continues to heighten tensions and poses a threatof international peace and security. Today disarmamentnegotiations are in a state of flux  seemingly not unpromising at times  suddenly becoming stale and replacedby the language of war. So far there have neither been armsneither reduction nor disarmament. Both contending policies ofthe great Powers assume that only more weapons couldprovide more protection. Negotiations and agreementson arms eon trot to date have done little to limit eitherweapons development or weapons quantities  and theprobability of nuclear war has not adequately or appreciably decreased.269.	In a situation where the enormous destructivepotential of nuclear weapons threatens the very survivalof mankind  fears about the dangers of nuclear war havebecome more pronounced than before. The preventionof nuclear war has emerged into the foreground as theburning issue of the day. Arms and technology are buttools of war  and factors influencing the likelihood ofwar is more political in nature. Removing the possibilityof a nuclear clash means towering the existing dangerouslyhigh tensions. The great Powers have a special positionwith regard to this matter  because the ultimate decisionas to peace and war rests with them. In the present situation  there can be no major war without their participation and equally there can be no genuine peace unless bothof them will it. Thus they share between them an extremely heavy burden of responsibility  not only to theirown people out to entire humanity as a whole.270.	World public attention and expectations are nowfocused on the ongoing talks between the great Powersrelating to medium-range nuclear systems and strategicarmaments. The absence of progress so far is a sourceof concern  as a successful outcome of the bilateralnegotiations is widely tooled upon as an opening toprogress in other fields of disarmament. Every proposedsolution should be explored. It is an opportunity that maynot recur or exist for much longer to reach a solution thatwould ensure a secure region In Europe. We hope thata mutually acceptable formula will be worked out toproduce an outcome that the world can live with and thatis not merely to the benefit of one region and to thedetriment of another.271.	We cannot Ignore the factor of time involved inarms control negotiations. We stand at a crossroadswhere the inability of arms control negotiations to keeppace with technological innovation may pass the pointof manageability and make It impossible  in a practicalsense  to stop the accelerating arms race. The protractedpace of diplomatic negotiations and the relatively morerapid pace of technological progress means that armscontrol will become ever more difficult in the years tocome unless some bold Initiatives are taken to arrest andreverse the present trends. Meantime  white strategic armscontrol negotiations remain at an impasse  advances intechnology threatens to upset the nuclear balance.272.	No single regional dispute has so preoccupied theGeneral Assembly in sheer length of time as have theMiddle East situation and the Palestine question. TheMiddle East region remains in ferment  with hardly anyprospect of an early or satisfactory solution to the question of Palestine  the primary cause of the persistingcrisis. In spite of the efforts of many countries and ofthe United Nations  it is still not possible to perceive asolution to the many problems which fester in the MiddleEast and Palestine issues  such as the questions of Jerusalem  the Golan Heights and Israeli settlements in occupied territories. Matters have become further compounded by the factional divergence and strife in thePalestinian movement over views on how to achieve asolution. This has caused a setback in the most resentefforts of the peace process.273.	It is also evident that any solution of the MiddleEast problem  to be viable  must be comprehensive innature. Equally  a comprehensive settlement in the MiddleEast is not possible without meaningful progress towardsa solution of the Palestine problem.274.	The position of the delegation of Burma regardingthe issues of the Middle East and Palestine are quite clear.We recognize the realty that  whatever the circumstancesof its birth  Israel has come to stay in the Middle East.We accordingly recognize the right of Israel to exist. Wemaintain  however  that the right to exist does not conferon Israel or on any other State the right to acquire territory by war or to resort to unilateral acts that prejudicethe outcome of any final comprehensive settlement.Looking to future prospects  we feel that unless steps aretaken to hat the current process of Israeli settlements inoccupied territories  it may soon make impossible titlechances for pursuing a negotiated peace. Another prerequisite for transforming the ate is the withdrawn ofIsraeli forces from all Arab territories occupied since1967  a move that we believe will contribute towards ajust and enduring solution. As we perceive it  any negotiations aimed at achieving a just and comprehensivesettlement in the Middle East would necessarily entail agreater sensitivity in each of title parties to the dispute tothe concerns of the other side. What is needed is themutual recognition of the right of each side to exist. Thelegitimate rights of the Palestinian people to skiff-determination and a national homeland must be recognized side by side with the recognition of Israel's right to survival and need for security. Failing such accommodationbetween the two sides  peace in the Middle East wouldsurety is impossible. To our regret  the present antagonism displayed by the two sides holds littlepromise of making any headway towards a Middle Eastsolution.27$. in Lebanon the presence of unauthorized foreignforces continue to destabilize internal order. Protractedefforts to affect their withdrawal have so far foundered.Moreover  the intractable problem of community conflictstill faces the country. The problems of Lebanon stemfrom the unresolved issues of the Middle East and Palestine. Notwithstanding this fact  the overriding concernmust be to ensure the withdrawal of foreign forces fromthe country and the realization of the foot sovereignty territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon  within its international recognized boundaries  inaccordance with Security Council resolutions in thisregard.276.	The record of ongoing developments in southernAfrica provides little cause for optimism. There has beenno real change in the overall pattern of relations betweenSouth Africa and the African front-line States whichborder ft. Military escalation and interference continueto be directed and intensified against them. Moreover there is no let-up in South Africa's policies and practicesof racial discrimination and indeed  has been extended to Namibian territory whose attainment of independence has proved to be far?slower than expected.277.	Five years have passed since the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978 as a basis for an Internationally recognized settlement for the independence ofNamibia. Yet still today the people of that Territoryremain the victims of a stubborn colonial domination.278.	The efforts of the contact group representing theworld's most powerful countries have also failed to influence South Africa  at today there is hardly any prospectof a solution to the question of Namibia. A furtherdilatory factor causing concern is the injection of extraneous issues that tend to distort title reality of the Namibian question. The delegation of Burma cannot in goodfaith support motives that are incompatible with the letterand spirit of Security Council resolution 423 1973. Weintoed the view that any parallelism or linkage between titleindependence of Namibia and extraneous at irrelevantissues cat only raise doubts as to the attitude of thosewho promote the concept?279. Experience with regard to the situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea reveals both the need for and thedifficulty of instating regional conflicts from great Power relationships. The implication of both situationsare already reflected in the politics of the respectiveregions. They also demonstrate the basic risks involvedin intervention in any country by an externalPower. Beth interventions have been fraught with difficulties for the intervener and the affected. In each casethe difficulties are of a nature to raise the question ofwhether the form of intervention has realty served thenational interests of the intervener. White in the shortrange certain goals may have been achieved  a politicalprice has to be paid in the way of adverse world opinion.2S0. in line with our oft-expressed views on Afghanistanand Kampuchea  we consider that the withdrawal offoreign troops from both countries is fundamental forarriving at a political solution. It is also a preliminaryto forging better relations in the region. This is a matterof principle with us  for any breach of the basic principlesof International rotations  as enunciated in the Charterof the United Nations  cannot b: condoned  since itcreates a dangerous precedent with wide-ranging indications. We say this because the principles of the Charter are applicable to all States Members of the UnitedNations and will survive only if Members faithfullyuphold them.28. in Afghanistan the good offices of the Secretary-General have led to some movement in the right directionregarding essential elements for a comprehensive politicalsolution. We welcome these constructive efforts and hopethat a breakthrough will be achieved to enable the Afghanpeople to determine their own destiny free from outsideinterference and to enable the refugees to return.282. Regarding Kampuchea  the stalemate continuesdespite many diplomatic moves In and outside the region.The delegation of Burma considers that the achievementof a political solution in Kampuchea must necessarily heworked out by the Kampuchean people themselves without outside interference. We would hope that both internal and external conditions will in time mature to allowfor a peaceful way for national reconciliation and apolitical solution responsive to the desperate seed of tinKampuchean people to survive and to live in peace.284. Recent forecasts talk of an economic upturnin some highly industrialized countries  the momentumof recovery is as yet too stowed to warrant jubilation. However  in many respects the world economic situation cannot really be described as being responsive. World trade remains sluggish  and interestrates are high and have rapidity increased the level ofdebt service payments. As a result  the internationalmonetary and financial systems have been placed undersevere strain. Points to the fact that fundamentalchanges in the pattern of world economic relations especially In trade and finance are overdue.285.	New ways and means must also be found to narrow the ever-widening gap between the export earningsof developed and developing countries  so as to establisha realistic and equitable basic relationship of a lasting nature. We believe that the balance of world opinion. is swinging toward far-reaching solutions and constructive international action to redress the ills of the worldeconomy and not towards a series of stop-gap  ad Acemeasures.286.	A resolution in favour of the launching of globalnegotiations  adopted by the General Assembly in 1979 was aimed at spurring the desiredprocess of transformation it: international economicrelations. We are disturbed that this has met with opposition from the richer developed nations  which makesthe start of negotiations still uncertain.287.	Furthermore  growing links between national economies have enhanced their interdependence to the extentthat unilateral action by a single country or group ofcountries to pull out of the present crisis may prove tobe ineffective and inadequate. In spite of this  there hasbeen a greater resort to unilateral action  and international economic co-operation has slackened at a timewhen it needs to be greatly strengthened. A healthy worldeconomic structure can emerge only with the recognitionthat widened avenues of international co-operation andagreement is basic requisites to put the world economyback on the path of recovery and sustained growth. Wehope that our present deliberations will help us advancethis prospect and that the examination of world issuesWill prove fruitful. "
"92",4758,"MNG",38,1983,"25.	Mr. President  may I first sincerely congratulate you on your election to the high post of President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly and wish you every success in this responsible work.26.	The Mongolian delegation expresses its deep gratitude to Mr. Imre Hollai for the skilful and successful manner in which he guided the work of the last session.27.	The Mongolian People's Republic welcomes Saint Christopher and Nevis to membership of the United Nations and wishes that country every success in its independent development.28.	At the present session the General Assembly is once again facing the acute cardinal issues of the present day which require positive solutions. Among them the problem of preserving and strengthening world peace and security takes top priority. The threat of nuclear holocaust is not only not receding  but the reverse trend is in fact being maintained. The arms race is escalating still further and is about to reach the point of no return. The peoples of the world are deeply alarmed at these developments. Much is expected from this world forum in easing international political tension and adopting effective measures to facilitate  above all  military detente.29.	It is imperative that a reliable barrier be erected against the slide towards the nuclear abyss. The Mongolian delegation  like many others  trusts that the work of this session will be permeated precisely with this spirit of the main requirement of this critical juncture. In this connection I should like to emphasize the urgent need for combining the efforts of all forces advocating peace  democracy and social progress in the interests of preserving life on Earth.30.	The causes of the continued aggravation of the international atmosphere lie in the aggressive policy of imperialism  which runs counter to the interests and aspirations of all peoples. At present  progressive mankind is facing a most dangerous recurrence of such a policy. The most reactionary circles of the West  primarily the United States  bent on world domination  have set themselves the reckless goal of dealing a blow against genuine socialism and at the same time against the forces of national and social liberation as well.31.	This can be very clearly seen in the ""crusade"" declared by the present United States Administration and its allies against socialism  which is being pursued everywhere. First and foremost  their main thrust is to upset the existing military and strategic parity and to achieve unilateral superiority in this field for the West. To this end programmes for increasing first-strike nuclear weapons  including space warfare systems  are being intensively carried out.32.	Vast regions thousands of miles from the American coasts are declared zones of ""vital interest"" and are being turned into bases for military preparations by the United States.33.	Slanderous propaganda about an alleged ""Soviet military threat"" is being intensified and adventurous provocations against the Soviet Union  like the recent sophisticated act of espionage in which a South Korean civilian plane was involved  are being increased.34.	Hostile intrigues against socialist Cuba  Poland and the countries of Indo-China are being continued. The undeclared war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan still continues. Acts of intervention against Nicaragua  Angola and Mozambique are being overtly committed. Attempts are being made to stifle the national liberation movements in Central America  Africa and the Middle East.35.	Sinister acts aimed at splitting the ranks of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Organization of African Unity and other international organizations which advocate peace and independence and the promotion of the social progress of peoples are still being committed.36.	Washington high-handedly encroaches upon the very foundations of normal international relations. The ""show of force"" and ""muscle-flexing"" have become common. Its weapons vocabulary is filled with the language of sanctions and diktat.37.	The countries of the socialist community counter the imperialist policy of co- ordination with a policy of peace and equitable co-operation. Further clear evidence of this is the statement made on 28 September this year by Y. V. Andropov  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.38.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic welcomes Mr. Andropov's statement as confirmation of the Soviet Union's determination further to safeguard the peace and security of peoples and fully support the assessments and conclusions contained therein.39.	The peaceful and constructive policy of the overwhelming majority of States of the world  primarily the non-aligned countries  is also an important factor opposing the imperialist policy of aggression and diktat. The positive results of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi from 71. ""2 March 1983  represent an important contribution to the efforts of peace-loving forces to remove the threat of war and strengthen international security. The growing anti-war  anti-nuclear movement of the peoples is playing an increasingly significant role in the struggle to curb the arms race.40.	The results of the Madrid meeting of States which participated in the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe clearly indicate that there exists a potential for political will and common sense in international affairs. It is particularly noteworthy that 35 States  representing two different socio-political systems  have agreed in the present complex situation to continue the dialogue in order to make detente effective and even more viable. One of the key measures to be taken in this direction is to ensure the success of the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe.41.	The North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] plans to start deploying in December on the territories of some countries of Western Europe a new generation of American nuclear missiles  which would completely upset the existing military and strategic balance and thus generate a new round of the nuclear arms race. This plan is fraught with a great danger to peace not only for Europe but for the whole world.42.	At the very beginning of this crucial yearâon 5 Januaryâthe States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  at the meeting at Prague of their Political Consultative Committee  adopted apolitical declaration in which they presented a set of most timely and extremely important proposals on the prevention of the threat of war and the strengthening of the peace and security of nations. These proposals were later reaffirmed and further developed in the statement  of the leaders of those States at their meeting in Moscow on 28 June.43.	Since then the Soviet Union has put forward a series of realistic and constructive proposals to curb the arms race  particularly at the ongoing Soviet-American talks at Geneva on the limitation of medium-range nuclear armaments  proposals which create a good basis for reaching mutually acceptable agreement between the parties.44.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic attaches exceptional importance to these talks for the implementation of practical measures in the field of disarmament and considers that the basic prerequisite for their successful outcome is strict observance of the principle of equality and equal security. The ""zero option""  ""interim solution"" or similar pseudo-initiatives by the United States which disregard this basic principle serve simply to conceal the true designs of their proponents  who are trying to achieve military superiority over the socialist world. It is our hope that common sense and realism will ultimately prevail and that the Soviet-American talks will yield the desired results.45.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic welcomes and supports the new Soviet initiatives submitted to the current session aimed at halting the arms race  in particular the nuclear arms race  achieving disarmament and strengthening trust between States.46.	The adoption by the General Assembly of the draft declaration on the condemnation of nuclear war proposed by the Soviet Union  would be an act of paramount political significance  mobilizing world public opinion against those that are hatching plots to use nuclear weapons first.47.	A quantitative and qualitative freeze of nuclear weapons  as proposed by the Soviet Union  would create the most favourable conditions for taking practical measures in the field of nuclear disarmament.48.	The militarization of outer space would be the most dangerous stage of the arms race  fraught as it would be with the most unpredictable consequences for mankind. The Soviet Union's new proposal for the conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the use of force in outer space and from space against the earth [see -4/33/VP4] would provide a real opportunity to prevent such a course of events.49.	The Mongolian delegation hopes that those States which these proposals primarily concern will treat them responsibly and respond to them positively.50.	In this connection  I should like to note that the international community is fully entitled to ask why the nuclear Powers have not responded properly to the unilateral commitment by the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. Why are the Western countries not responding to the initiative of the socialist States on the conclusion of a treaty  which would be open to all other countries  on the mutual non-use of military force and the maintenance of peace and relations between the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the States members of NATO?51.	It is clear that a positive reaction to these peace initiatives would greatly improve the international situation.52.	The Mongolian delegation believes it is necessary to resume the interrupted disarmament talks. It is equally imperative to begin new talks where negotiations are necessary but have not yet begun. This applies  first and foremost  to the question of the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests.53.	It is also important that the Committee on Disarmament achieve tangible results as soon as possible on other issues under considerationâin particular  the banning of chemical  neutron and radiological weapons  the banning of the deployment of weapons of any kind in outer space and the strengthening of security guarantees for non-nuclear Stat is.54.	The complex and tense situation in the Asian continent is causing serious concern to the peoples of the region. The main source of instability is the growing military presence of the United States  which is stepping up its efforts to draw Asian countries into the orbit of   its military  policy. The doctrine of so-called limited nuclear war is being given a real Asian dimension by actions to deploy American nuclear missiles in certain parts of the continent. The situation has been further aggravated by the fact that  as a result of the continuing interference by the imperialists and their accomplices in the affairs of Asian peoples  no positive solution has been found for the existing explosive situations and acute problems.55.	This applies first and foremost to the situation in the Middle East where the United States  by encouraging Israeli aggression in every possible way  is striving to impose its imperial order. It is embarking upon a direct military adventure and involving its NATO allies. These activities are in fact leading to the partition of Lebanon  turning parts of its territory into a springboard for intervention against Syria and the progressive forces of the region. The current developments in Lebanon once again confirm the complete bankruptcy of half-way policies and separate deals in solving the existing problems and testify to the imperative need for the immediate withdrawal of the troops of the aggressors from the country.56.	Mongolia has consistently supported a comprehensive settlement for the Middle East problem. We consider that this can be facilitated by convening an international conference with the participation of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine. The Mongolian People's Republic fully supports the Geneva Declaration on Palestine' and the Programme of Action for the Achievement of Palestinian Rights' adopted at the recent International Conference on the Question of Palestine.57.	In South-East Asia  the imperialist and hegemonistic forces are attempting to achieve their narrow  selfish aims by inciting certain States against ethers. They are doing everything they can to block the efforts being made to create an atmosphere of trust and mutual understanding among the countries of that region and are continuing to interfere in their internal affairs. These same forces are preventing the People's Republic of Kampuchea from occupying its legitimate seat at the United Nations.58.	The Mongolian People's Republic regards the new constructive initiatives put forward by the three countries of Indo-China in their declaration dated 23 February 1983  published at the conclusion of their summit conference at Vietnams  as a timely step towards easing the tension in South-East Asia and towards the creation of the necessary conditions for changing that region into a zone of peace  stability and co-operation.59.	The Mongolian People's Republic favours a political solution to the problem around Afghanistan on the basis of the realistic proposals made by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on 14 May 1980s and 24 August 1981.3 A political settlement can be achieved only if all forms of interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  including armed interference  are completely eliminated and a reliable guarantee provided that such intervention will cease and not recur in the future. We hope that the dialogue between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and Pakistan  through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  will yield positive results.60.	The Mongolian People's Republic has consistently supported the struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful and democratic reunification of their country without foreign interference. In this connection  we stress once again the need for the withdrawal of the American troops and nuclear facilities from the south of Korea.61.	The Mongolian delegation  as before  considers that the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  which only plays into the hands of the imperialist forces  should be ended.62.	Mongolia  together with all peace-loving States  supports the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace and favours the speedy convening of an international conference to that end.63.	The existence of a great number of sources of tension and conflicts on the vast continent of Asia makes it incumbent upon us to enforce the principle of the non- use of force as an indisputable law in relations between the States of that continent. That is what gives special significance to our proposal put forward in 1981 on the conclusion of a convention on mutual non-aggression and non-use of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific/ This initiative of the Mongolian People's Republic is in keeping with the many concrete proposals and initiatives of other States directed at the solution of problems by peaceful means  at strengthening confidence and at developing good-neighbourly relations both in Asia and in other parts of the world.64.	The improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is of great importance for the strengthening of peace and security in Asia and throughout the world. It is in this context that we view the continued Soviet-Chinese contacts and consultations at the political level.65.	We greatly appreciate the positive role of the peaceful and constructive foreign policy of the Republic of India in Asian and world affairs.66.	The Mongolian People's Republic strongly condemns the policy of diktat  blackmail and gross interference by the United States in the internal affairs of the States of Central America and the Caribbean and its attempts to deny the peoples of that region the right to determine their own destiny.67.	The conflict in Central America should be settled by political means. In this connection  we welcome the efforts of the countries of the Contadora Group. In our opinion  the matter would also be facilitated by discussion of this problem in the United Nations.68.	The Mongolian people firmly support the struggle of the Namibian people and their vanguard  the South West Africa People's Organization [SPK4PO]  for their freedom and independence. It favours the immediate implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions on Namibia and rejects all attempts to link the solution of this problem to other  unrelated issues.69.	The Mongolian People's Republic supports the efforts to bring about a peaceful and just solution to the Cyprus problem that will ensure the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.70.	Mongolia fully supports the demands of the developing countries for practical measures aimed at a radical restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. We favour the early commencement of global negotiations within the framework of the United Nations on pressing economic problems  in accordance with the decision of the General Assembly.71.	The Mongolian People's Republic  true to the noble aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations  once again declares itself in favour of enhancing the effectiveness of this authoritative international Organization as an important instrument for maintaining the peace and security of the peoples. The Mongolian delegation would like to reaffirm that it will actively cooperate  as before  with other States Members of the United Nations to promote a positive solution to the problems confronting the present session."
"93",4800,"MOZ",38,1983,"ï»¿243.	 It is both an honour and a privilege for me  on behalf of the people and the Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique  to address the Assembly under the presidency of Mr. Illueca. Under his leadership  I am sure the thirty- eighth session will be crowned with success. To his predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  I wish to express my appreciation for the efforts he exerted during his term of office in a period characterized by cold-war hysteria and tension.244.	I take this opportunity to hail the Secretary- General for his indefatigable efforts in the search for a climate of mutual understanding between peoples and countries. His attachment to the lofty ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations reassures us of a better future for the Organization  which has just welcomed a new Member. May I add my voice to those of previous speakers in welcoming Saint Christopher and Nevis. I sincerely hope that in the near future other territories  such as Namibia and New Caledonia  will attain their independence and take their rightful place in the council of nations.245.	The international situation is characterized by the increasing aggressiveness of imperialism  which is leading to a multitude of local conflicts in many places on our planet  to an arms race and to a widening of the gap between developed and developing countries.246.	I am addressing the Assembly five months after the Fourth Congress of the FRELIMO Party   which made a thorough review of the international situation and concluded with great concern that: Imperialist circles have reintroduced on the international scene the climate of the cold war  while at the same time they promote the arms race at an unprecedented scale  increase the areas and sectors of tension and conflict  resort to intervention and overt military aggression and make use of pressure and economic blackmail. In its analysis  the highest organ of our Party observed that the situation obtaining in the world was the result of the actions of imperialist forces strenuously trying to strengthen their military capabilities in the name of their security and the need to secure and preserve vital routes leading to strategic mineral resources. Consequently  we are today witnessing an increase of tension everywhere which seriously threatens peace  security and international stability.247.	It was in the light of this situation  and in accordance with the cardinal principles that constitute the essence of the society we are building  that our Party  in dealing with foreign policy  reaffirmed our determination to continue the struggle for democracy  equality and peaceâa struggle which began with the launching of our people's war for national liberation.248.	Peace is a fundamental principle. By peace we mean the full enjoyment of freedom by all peoples  the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence  the right to development and progress  the firm refusal of humiliation  domination and exploitation and respect for the personality and dignity of man. Peace is an essential foundation for development and progress  the well-being and happiness of the people and the promotion of healthy co-operation on a basis of mutuality of interests.249.	The establishment of a climate of peace requires disarmament  relaxation of tension in international relations and peaceful coexistence. Peace cannot go hand in hand with colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism  apartheid and Zionism. In short  peace is incompatible with ad forms of oppression and exploitation. Wherever these e Is may be found  people will struggle for their freedom and independence  no matter what sacrifices they ma/ have to make. People will never accept exploitation  occupation and subjugation. Everywhere people crave for freedom and peace.250.	In southern Africa peace and security are more than ever before seriously threatened by imperialism in pursuit of its narrow interests  using the Nazi-fascist regime of apartheid South Africa. The independence of Mozambique  Angola and Zimbabweâcountries formerly dominated  like South Africa  by white minorities âhas led to a greater isolation of the South African regime because of its attempts to preserve the backward and inhuman system of251.	It is worth remembering that the Security Council  in its resolution 134 (1960)  considered that the racist regime of South Africa constitutes a threat to international peace and security. Three years later it adopted resolution 181 (1963)  in paragraph 1 of which the Council: .strongly deprecates the policies of South Africa in its perpetuation of racial discrimination as being inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations and contrary to its obligations as a Member of the United Nations. 252.	Those two resolutions were adopted without a single negative vote  and only two members abstained  namely  France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That was  I repeat  in 1960 and 1963  well before the independence of Mozambique  Angola and Zimbabwe. It is therefore gratifying to note that the international community  through the Security Council  had the foresight to take that position.253.	Today  however  there are some of us who like to consider the Nazi-fascist regime of apartheid as an ally. An ally against whom? Against the peoples of Mozambique  Angola  Zimbabwe and Botswana who are struggling for their freedom and dignity and for their fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter? Is it against Lesotho and Seychelles  which are constantly attacked bySouth African forces? Is it against the people of Namibia who have been struggling for more than three decades against the illegal occupation of their country by the Pretoria regime  in flagrant violation of numerous resolutions of the General Assembly  the Security Council  the OAU and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries calling for the independence of Namibia? Or is it against the group of independent and sovereign countries in southern Africa whose only crime is daring to show  at the doorstep of South Africa  the last bastion of racism in Africa  examples of societies without racial discrimination  where black and white are simply free men and women  citizens of free and sovereign countries?254.	South African regular armed forces occupy the southern part of the territory of the People's Republic of Angola  South African bombers attack the capital of the People's Republic of Mozambique  South African aircraft and ships carry out military operations and supply armed bandits who maim and murder our defenceless civilians and destroy our economic and social infrastructures. Armed gangs in the service of Pretoria raid Botswana and the Kingdom of Lesotho. The apartheid regime undertakes acts of destabilization against Zambia  Zimbabwe and the Kingdom of Swaziland.255.	Who threatens whom? Which of them should have its security guaranteedâthe apartheid regime which is the aggressor  the warmonger and the expansionist  or the sovereign countries attacked by a powerful military machine encouraged and strengthened by ever larger financial  economic and military investments?256.	According to some sources  foreign investments in South Africa at the end of 1982 totalled more than $32 billionâthree times more than just a few years ago. Is that the way one intends to pressure South Africa into behaving in conformity with the principles and objectives of the United Nations? Recently  Africa and indeed the international community were profoundly shocked at the news that the apartheid regime had been awarded $50 million to promote its nuclear development.257.	The more numerous the acts of aggression and destabilization and occupation that South Africa perpetrates against sovereign States Members of the United Nations  the more investments  technological support and markets are offered to it. The more one invests in the South African regime  the more weapons are needed for its survival and the more weapons and military assistance are granted it to continue acts of aggression and perpetrate genocide  not only against the black people of South Africa but also against other peoples of the region. Is that the purpose of the constructive engagement  that has been proposed to the States of southern Africa?258.	The People's Republic of Mozambique and other front-line States  conscious of their international responsibility  have endeavoured to preserve peace in our region. We have spared no effort to avoid a conflict of uncontrollable proportions in southern Africa.259.	During the war for independence in Zimbabwe the front-line States showed how anxious we were to avoid the escalation of tension in our region. In spite of the acts of military aggression and destruction perpetrated by the Smith regime  we offered our good offices to accelerate the process of independence for Zimbabwe. In the same spirit  the front-line States agreed to participate in the diplomatic exercise that led to the formulation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  approved by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978). In the course of this whole process  SWAPO and the front-line States made concessions in the name of peace and in order to accelerate the process of independence for Namibia. Trusting in the good faith of the so-called contact group  we agreed to discuss ail questions concerning Namibia in spite of the machinations of some of its members.260.	We accept a dialogue which will bring peace to our region  and peace can be brought only with genuine independence for Namibia in conformity with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the eradication of apartheid and racial discrimination. At its thirty-eighth session the General Assembly must irrevocably condemn any linkage or parallelism whatsoever between the independence of Namibia and the withdrawal of the international Cuban forces from Angola.261.	Who is it who must withdraw from the People's Republic of Angola? Is it those who in conformity with Article 51 of the Charter support a people  a legitimate Government recognized by the international community to be defending its sovereignty  or the aggressor which occupies a part of the Angolan territory and commits a typical act of aggression as defined in resolution 3314 (XXIX)?262.	Peoples from all over the world applauded the action of the North American troops when they crossed the Atlantic to face the Nazi hordes that were spreading death and destruction in Europe. Why should we now be asked to leave the men  women and children of Angola to be massacred by the	regime  the nazism of our time?263.	We denounce the destruction of Cangamba  an Angolan town situated 500 kilometers from the border with Namibia  and we demand that South Africa be made to pay for all the damage done to the People's Republic of Angola. We unreservedly and strongly condemn the South African occupation of part of Angolan territory  and we demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Pretoria's troops.264.	It is with grave concern that we notice that peace and security are being threatened in other parts of Africa beyond our region. In our continent we witness the intervention of foreign forces in the internal affairs of countries even when Africa is in a condition to solve the problems that arise.265.	In Western Sahara  we are concerned that hopes of peace are once again being shattered. The refusal of the Kingdom of Morocco to enter into negotiations with POLISARIO 2 in conformity with resolution AHG/ Res. 104 (XIX) recently adopted by the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [seemeans that there will be no cease-fire and that therefore a referendum  as called for by the OAU and the United Nations  will not take place. We exhort the Kingdom of Morocco  in the name of peace in the Maghreb and to strengthen the unity of our continent  to comply with the spirit and letter of that resolution. It is true that the winds are not always favourable to vessels  but the winds of freedom are always favourable to the freedom of peoples.266.	In East Timor  we had hoped that the cease-fire agreed upon between FRETILIN  and the Government of Indonesia meant that Indonesia  a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement  had finally heeded the cry for freedom of the Maubere people  who are struggling with determination against the Indonesian occupation. But it was a short-lived hope. According to the latest reports  the Jakarta Government has unleashed 20 000 more troops against the East Timorese people.267.	To prevent the world from learning about the massacre perpetrated by the Indonesian forces  the Government of Indonesia prevented the International Committee of the Red Cross from continuing its activities. Indonesia wants to build a wall of silence in order to choke the will for freedom of the Maubere people. Nothing  absolutely nothing  can subjugate a people struggling for its freedom. Indonesia might succeed in massacring the people of East Timor  but it will never dominate them.268.	I sincerely hope that the deferment of the question of East Timor to the thirty-ninth session will create the necessary climate for the re-establishment of the ceasefire and dialogue and that that will allow the Secretary- General successfully to carry out his mandate according to resolution 37/30.269.	We are certain that the East Timorese people will regain its freedom and that under the leadership of FRETILIN  its sole legitimate representative; a free and sovereign nation will emerge in the land of the Maubere people.270.	We should never accept the fragmentation of the Lebanese State. A year ago the international community was shocked by the massive aggression by Israel and the massacres in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila. The Lebanese people  who did not expect to hear the sounds of firearms once again and so soon  are confronted with the new warship and new aircraft that bombard Lebanese soil. Lebanon has thus become a training camp for the use of the most sophisticated weaponry.271.	How many more wars will there be in the Middle East before nations finally recognize that the Palestinian people  led by the PLO  its sole legitimate representative  has a right to a free and sovereign State?272.	Any attempt to preserve Zionism means going against the fundamental interest of the Jews and the Arabs. This will only perpetuate the state of war in the Middle East.273.	The proposal made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of the Korean nation constitutes a basis for the solution of the problem  and I call upon those concerned to refrain from any action that might hinder this process.274.	Cyprus is another country that is yearning for peace and for its reunification. I call upon the Secretary- General to redouble his efforts and upon all those concerned to co-operate with him.275.	The People's Republic of Mozambique greets with satisfaction the efforts of the Contadora Group to promote peace  security and stability in the Central American region. Mozambique forcefully condemns the acts of destabilization by imperialism in that region and appeals to all concerned to take practical and efficient measures with a view to ensuring that differences affecting the region are resolved by peaceful means.276.	The proposals of the Contadora Group  the six- point plan presented by Nicaragua  and the positive response by the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation and the Revolutionary Democratic Front concerning the situation in El Salvador offer a serious opportunity for a negotiated  lasting solution to the grave problems confronting the people of Central America.277.	Peace in Central America means the cessation of military manoeuvres  the end of acts of aggression against Nicaragua  the return of Guantanamo to the Cuban people and the withdrawal of support for dictatorial and unpopular regimes.278.	In the course of the general debate it has been made clear that the struggle for peace and the prevention of the danger of a nuclear confrontation constitute a priority for all humanity  for what is at stake is the very survival of mankind. Economic and social development depends on peace among nations. Hopes for a prosperous and bright future for all people also depend on peace. The struggle for peace means a serious and constructive commitment by all  in particular the nuclear Powers  to the efforts to achieve general and complete disarmament  the cessation of the arms race  the freezing of all nuclear weapons and the reduction and eventual destruction of those weapons.279.	The transformation of the Indian Ocean into a nuclear-free zone of peace  the dismantling of all the imperialist military bases stationed in that area and the speedy implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace	are components of the struggle for disarmament. We note with deep concern that  to the detriment of the interests of the Indian Ocean States and of the international community as a whole  the  ad hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean has once again been unable to carry out its mandate because of the position of certain Western countries that persist in creating obstacles to the holding of the Conference on the Indian Ocean. We reaffirm our support for holding the Conference on the Indian Ocean and for the adoption of concrete measures leading to the implementation of the Declaration.280.	The success of the Madrid follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe shows us that whenever there is good will it is possible to overcome differences for the benefit of peace and cooperation among nations. We hope that the same thing will happen concerning the Geneva negotiations and in ill other negotiations  be they political  economic or of a security nature.281.	The struggle for disarmament is a struggle for peace and development. Without disarmament there will be no peace and without peace there will be no development. The failure of the second special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament worries us  inasmuch as it has intensified the arms race and consequently increased military budgets. On the other hand  economic aid to developing countries has decreased dramatically. There cannot be peace and lasting security on our planet as long as $800 billion are spent annually on armaments  to the detriment of development programmes.282.	There have been several efforts by the international community to find the mechanism for solving the great problems that affect humanity at the present time. However  those efforts have been blocked by the attitude of certain developed market economy countries which have systematically refused serious negotiations and opted instead for restrictive and protectionist solutions. What happened at the Summit of Industrialized Nations at Williamsburg last May is an example of this.283.	It is not by exporting inflation and exerting pressure on developing countries that the problems of the industrialized countries will be solved. In a world where life expectancy in Africa  Latin America and Asia is 30 years less than in the industrialized countries and the per capita income there is $240 compared with over $1 300 in the developed countries  it is urgent to introduce profound changes in the current international economic structures in the fields of trade  finance and energy and in other fields. The People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms its support for the efforts to launch global negotiations as a matter of urgency.284.	It is not possible to come out of the economic chaos as evidenced by the recent failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development when a group of countries persists in being the absolute master  the dictator  in a game that involves the lives of more than 2 billion human beings. Therefore  we the dominated countries  we the exploited  we the countries whose role is only that of suppliers of raw materials and producers of wealth for the developed countries  must formally and seriously engage in a selfless and co-ordinated effort to achieve collective self-reliance. We will never experience development if we submit ourselves to the development model pursued by the West. Theirs is the world of competition  protectionism and reckless exploitation of our wealth. Our world must be one of mutual assistance and co-operation that is healthy and advantageous to everyone.285.	It is imperative that the current system of economic relations be dismantled and that new mechanisms be created to enable collective self-reliance to be an important element of international co-operation  a true cooperation among States based on the common will to eliminate hunger  disease  illiteracy and misery. The countries of southern Africa  conscious of the need selflessly to co-ordinate their efforts and resources  have been implementing the programmes defined by the Southern Development Co-ordination Conference.286.	We salute the countries and the international institutions that have helped the development plans defined by our regional institutions at a time when our region  besides feeling the structural effects of current economic relations  is being affected by a long drought  the worst in the past 50 years. In Mozambique alone  this has affected about one third of our population and has brought havoc to agricultural production and death to tens of thousands of cattle because of the lack of green pasture and water. We appeal to the United Nations and to the international community in general for an increase in food aid to our people.287.	For the sake of brevity I have dwelt only on a relatively few issues. Mozambique's position on many other issues  such as those of Afghanistan and Kampuchea  is well known and remains unchanged.288.	Mozambique  because it believes in the United Nations system  has always resorted to the Organization  and will continue to do so  in the search for solutions to the political  economic  social and security problems that affect humanity. We always appear in this forum with the spirit of living up to  and demanding effective application of  the purposes and principles embodied in the San Francisco Charter.289.	In the face of the problems that affect international peace  security and co-operation  we believe that the United Nations forum cannot be one in which the developed and powerful countries limit themselves to taking note of the critical world situation and the developing and weak countries simply present their rosary of pain  misery and suffering. We therefore share the concerns of the Secretary-General  and we consider that it is urgent for the United Nations to become an efficient instrument for guaranteeing peace and international security and for ensuring the harmonious development of all peoples of the world. Let us therefore transform these ideals enshrined in the Charter into a reality of our times.290.	The struggle continues."
"94",4845,"MRT",38,1983,"ï»¿   42.	 Mr. President  your presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly is a matter of the greatest satisfaction to the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. You are an enlightened statesman and an experienced diplomat  but it is also the unswerving stand taken by your country  Panama  which constitutes for Mauritania and its delegation a source of encouragement and gives it the assurance that you will conduct the proceedings of this session in an exemplary way.43.	I should like to take this same opportunity to address to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  our gratitude for the excellent manner in which he conducted the proceedings of our preceding session.44.	I should also like to repeat to the Secretary-General the great esteem in which the delegation of Mauritania holds him and our confidence in him. We were particularly struck by the bold comments he included in his report on the work of the Organization.45.	Finally  I should like to bid welcome to the 158th and latest Member of the United Nations family  Saint Christopher and Nevis.46.	At this thirty-eighth session  the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania hardly feels able to display any optimism in the face of the increasingly aggressive attitudes of the various hegemonisms  the increasing decline of economies  the profound crisis which appears to affect  and will do so for a long time  international economic relations  further aggravating the present plight of the indigent masses of three quarters of mankind.47.	In the economic field  any constructive dialogue between the North and the South seems to be blocked for the foreseeable future. The particularly marked decline of the economies of the developing countries is becoming more acute as a result of a sudden and simultaneous combination of negative factors: the burden of debt is becoming heavier  loans are becoming harder to obtain  commodity prices are declining and protectionism is spreading.48.	Since 1980 our countries have suffered a net loss of earnings amounting to about $200 billion. Even worse  their indebtedness for 1982 has risen to about $630 billion. Commodity prices  that is to say the prices of the bulk of the exports of the developing countries  have today fallen to the lowest level in real terms  that of 1945.49.	In addition to these phenomena  engendered by the structural fragility within our countries and the extreme vulnerability of practically all developing economies  dependent as they are on the outside world  there are all kinds of natural disasters  as well as the increasing inflation imported from the developed economies. This is all happening at the precise time when we are witnessing a very appreciable decline in the global volume of public and private development assistance.50.	These various factors only serve to make even heavier the already intolerable burdens of the developing countries. Thus  the countries of the third world  which are severely handicapped for all kinds of reasonsâ historical  social  cultural  political and economicâhave found themselves in the last three years in a new situation from which there is no escape.51.	This bad or even disastrous financial situation is clearly reflected in the difficulties encountered in the replenishment of the development funds maintained by IMF and the World Bank; and also by the large decline in voluntary contributions for UNDP. The impact of this decline is very damaging because the participation of UNDP has always played and continues to play an important  if not an indispensable  complementary role in national efforts by beneficiary countries.52.	More generally  and in terms of the difficulties encountered in the various forums of dialogue between developing and industrialized countries  while the persistent obstacles to getting global negotiations under way have proved frustrating  the relative failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development this summer at Belgrade was a great disappointment. Thus  in spite of the appeal for dialogue and consensus made by the Ministers of the member countries of the Group of 77 in the Buenos Aires Platform in April 1983 2 and in spite of the flexibility shown by the same countries at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi  the response of the other side failed to match the hopes legitimately raised by the theoretical declarations of good intentions. The frail consensus achieved should not allow us to forget the magnitude of the disappointment concerning the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  the one forum from which we were entitled to expect something and which was the repository of the hopes of the developing world for an improvement in a generally unfavourable world situation. The Secretary-General came out boldly as the interpreter of this attitude in his report on the work  of the Organization	in which he emphasized:  It is regrettable that efforts at flexibility  as evinced  for example  at the Buenos Aires and New Delhi meetings  did not evoke a comparable response. 53.	The Islamic Republic of Mauritania is of the view that for this indispensable global and fundamental reform of the international economic systemâthe need for which has been stressed by everyoneâto take place  the new actions of developing countries would have to be met with a more favourable attitude and a more clear-cut political will on the part of the rich countries. That is why we are hoping for a distinct change of attitude with regard to the new proposals of the third world for the launching of global negotiations in two stages: first  the adoption of immediate measures and structural reforms over the short and medium term; and  secondly  over the long term  the launching of global negotiations.54.	This praiseworthy and realistic initiative has the merit of concerning itself with immediate  pressing needs while proposing a reasonable time-frame for the preparation  through painstaking negotiations  of the radical reform  so much desired and so desirable  of an overall situation which has reached the danger point and which will seriously affect the world for years to come and the prospects of peace and war in the future.55.	Africa  a continent which suffers so sorely from all the symptoms characterizing underdevelopment  is particularly anxious that there should be a redefinition of world economic relations which would bring about a greater degree of equity  genuine solidarity and security for all.56.	The document recently distributed under the symbol A/38/307  which deals with co-operation between the United Nations and the OAU  is eloquent in this regard.57.	However  the same questions which were raised at the 1982 meeting between the two organizations are now an even more urgent item on the agenda. These are: the heightening of the awareness of the world public of the urgent problems of the growing desertification of the north and south of the Sahara; the dissemination of information on what is known as the Lagos Plan of Action; and the appropriate treatment of the food situation in Africa.58.	With regard to the Lagos Plan of Action s and the Final Act of Lagos   of 1980  its declared objective is to put an end to the economic over-dependence of Africa and bring about self-sufficient economic growth and self- sustained development throughout the continent. The Lagos Plan to put into effect the strategy laid down in Monrovia responds perfectly to the overall concerns of the developing countries in the face of the crises which threaten them in the fields of energy  the balance of payments  external indebtedness  food  drought  and so forth. These last two problems  those of food and drought  are thrown into stark relief in our continent  which  barely 20 years ago was self-sufficient in terms of food. It is precisely the ecological changes  caused particularly by the spectacular advance of the desert towards the fertile North Africa and the steppes and forests of black Africa  but also the demographic explosion and other factors which have done so much to disrupt the balance of self-sufficiency. In the 1970s our continent increased tenfold the volume of its cereal imports.59.	We welcome the praiseworthy action by FAO and WFP to limit the damage caused by the climatic disasters  and we support the decision taken by the Committee on World Food Security to adopt a new integrated concept in three areas: ensuring food production and sufficient supplies; stabilizing supplies and markets; and ensuring access to supplies.60.	The Islamic Republic of Mauritania  a Sahelian country  welcomes the remarkable action undertaken in our region by the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office and hopes that we shall see a strengthening of co-operation between this Office and the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel. When the Chairman of this Committee  the head of State of Cape Verde  Mr. Pereira  addressed this Assembly on 27 September on behalf of all the member countries of that Committee  he forcefully  clearly and objectively expressed the essential concerns which we all share.61.	The Islamic Republic of Mauritania  which shares the general climatic conditions of our brothers in the Sahel  is  however  unique in terms of the amount of its national territory which is desert. It is in our country  that the desert is advancing most rapidly  reaching and sometimes passing the river valley  which is the granary of the country  and also reaching the pastures of the south  the east and the centre  which are the principal grazing grounds of our sheep  cattle and goats. According to estimates drawn up by specialists  if the present climatic conditions persist  at the present rate of exploitation  the forests of Mauritania are liable to disappear in a few years. Our sizable cattle holdings  which meet the needs of so many markets both in black Africa and in North Africa  have suffered serious losses and are today threatened with irreparable damage.62.	The already acute food shortage of the past few years has grown dangerously worse this year. Our grain production meets barely a tenth of our national needs. This situation threatens thousands of nomads and the rural and semi-rural population and has already led to an uncontrolled exodus towards our urban centres and particularly to our young capital.63.	At the national level  by taking urgent steps and through a popular mobilization  the Military Committee for National Salvation and the Government have been actively engaged in alleviating the serious consequences of the drought and the resultant acute food shortage. However  in spite of the sacrifices we have made  the scope of the phenomenon far exceeds our means  which are in any case limited.64.	I should like to take this opportunity to thank all friendly countries that have given us aid and assistance. We would also like to express once more our appreciation for the increased efforts being made with regard to our country by the organizations of the United Nations system  FAO  UNICEF  WHO  UNDP and others  as well as by the International Red Cross.65.	If the international economic situation gives no cause for optimism  the world political scene  for its part  is marked by dangerous threats to international peace and security because of the emergence of new hotbeds of tension  in addition to the aggravation of long-standing situations. Indeed  since our last session the international political situation has been marked by a growing deterioration that has spared no continent.66.	Thus in the Middle East Israel  abetted by protectors determined to ensure for it the benefit of its military conquests and more intransigent than ever  is pursuing with impunity its policy of faits accomplis and defiance of international opinion and legality. Israel's unswerving policy remains unchanged. It consists of the intransigent refusal to recognize in any way the national rights of the Arab Palestinian people and the equally categorical rejection of any eventual return of occupied Arab territories. The Zionist occupation authorities are carrying out all kinds of actions aimed at making irreversible the illegal annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights and the Judaization of the Arab city of Al-Quds  which is both Moslem and Christian.67.	On another level the Israeli authorities are giving free rein to religious fanaticism and racism with the unconcealed aim of speeding up the blatant annexation of the West Bank  which is the true objective of a deliberate and provocative policy aimed at setting up an ever-growing number of settlements there.68.	Lastly  the Zionist entity is increasing its manoeuvres to delay the evacuation of its aggressive forces from Lebanese national territory. In this connection the Islamic Republic of Mauritania remains convinced that true and lasting peace in the Middle East must include  first  the total and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Al-Quds  and  secondly  the restoration to the Palestinian Arab people  under the leadership of their sole  authentic and legitimate representative  the PLO  of their inalienable and imprescriptible rights  and in particular their sacred right to establish a sovereign State on the land of their ancestors.69.	In this regard we are gratified at the conclusions of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine held at Geneva last month. Our delegation believes that the Final Declaration of the Conference' represents the minimum basis upon which a true and lasting peace in occupied Palestine can be built. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania calls for the sincere and complete implementation of the programme of action adopted at that conference.'70.	Our country  which continues to rely upon the United Nations for the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  appeals to the Security Council to face up to its responsibilities with regard to that important question. The Council must more effectively impose sanctions upon Israel for its intolerable defiance of the Organization. We particularly regret the constant use of the veto  which has prevented the Council from condemning the adventurist policy of an entity that is so little devoted to peace and so little attached to the Charter of the United Nations  to international law and to justice. My country shares the view expressed by the Secretary-General in Ms report on the work of the Organization	where he states: The Council must be primarily used for the prevention of armed conflict and the search for solutions. Otherwise it will become peripheral to major issues  and in the end the world could pay  as it has before  a heavy price for not learning the lessons of history. It goes without saying that such an abdication by the Council would have unforeseeable consequences.71.	Nowhere do such lessons of history better deserve to be borne in mind than in the Middle East. The confiscation of Palestine  the forced exile of its people  the acts of aggression against the Arab populations of the region  the insult to their past  the lack of progress that marks their present and the uncertainty weighing over their future provide the usurper with no real security  whatever his temporary military superiority. No foreign force can indefinitely impose its will upon our peoples or survive within our midst if the only language it can utter is that of force and hegemonism.72.	The latest victim of such brutal hegemonism is the fraternal country of Lebanon  to which we express our total solidarity in the realization  within the framework of the overall strategy of the Arab nation as a whole  of its national goals for the liberation of all its homeland and the preservation of its territorial unity and the unity of its people. We call upon all brothers and friends  and upon the whole of the international community as well  to increase their aid to and support for Lebanon in order to enable it to ensure national reconciliation through the consolidation of the latest cease-fire agreement  which was so difficult to obtain begin its economic reconstruction and achieve the total  immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces of aggression from its soil.73.	In the Gulf  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania once again deplores the senseless continuation of a conflict that is so cruel  so painful and so terribly costly in human tosses and material damage  namely  the conflict between Iran and Iraq  which share a rich and age-old cultural and spiritual heritage and a long common history of coexistence and fruitful and fraternal co-operation.74.	Our country associates itself with the Ummah of Islam  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations in calling for the immediate cessation of hostilities between these two fraternal countries and for the opening of negotiations between them in order to reach a definitive solution to their differences.75.	Africa  of which my country is an integral part  is also the victim of conflicts and interference that drain the energies of our continent and swallow up its resources.76.	In southern Africa  putting into practice the lessons that its emulator and ally  Israel  has imparts so lavishly to it  South Africa is increasing its delaying tactics to put off the independence of Namibia and to extend its aggression to the fraternal countries of that vital region of our continent  particularly Angola  Mozambique  Lesotho  Botswana  Zambia.77.	For the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only realistic basis that should and must serve for the return of international legality to Namibia by restoring the authority and exclusive responsibility of the United Nations there in order to bring an end to the usurpation of the territory and permit the sovereign expression of the will of its people. We regret that there has been no progress since the last session of the Assembly  despite the reaffirmation last year by the Western countries making up what is known as the contact group of their commitment to the rapid implementation of resolution 435 (1978) in order to enable the Namibian people to exercise their right to self-determination.78.	For its part  our country expresses again here its complete solidarity with the fraternal Namibian people and its legitimate representative  SWAPO  which in our view remains the sole negotiating partner for a settlement of this question.79.	Mauritania reaffirms also its solidarity with Angola and the other fraternal front-line countries and its total commitment to the cause of their peoples. Our country took an active part in the Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  held last August at Geneva  and is gratified at the conclusions reached at that historic meeting. We repeat our total condemnation of that most hideous manifestation of racism  apartheid.80.	Mauritania notes with satisfaction the intensification of the political action and armed resistance by the majority being oppressed by the racist South African regime; we encourage the African National Congress to continue its leadership of the liberation struggle of the broad masses of that people to set up in South Africa a multiracial  democratic and egalitarian society.81.	Still on the subject of Africa  but in regard to our immediate frontiers  the problem of Western Sahara remains one of the major concerns of my country. Mauritania will never tire of drawing attention to the many serious implications of this conflict; we shall continue  until a satisfactory solution is found  to draw attention to the particularly fratricidal  ruinous character of the conflict.82.	We shall continue also to express our beliefânow shared by the whole of Africaâthat there cannot be any hope of a just and lasting solution without the guaranteed willingness of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco to embark on a direct  frank and constructive dialogue. This negotiation should lead to the conclusion of a cease-fireâand we should like to see this happen as soon as possibleâand to the redefinition of practical arrangements for the holding of a regular general referendum on self-determination  without any military or administrative constraints.83.	The nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held last June at Addis Ababa  unanimously committed the two parties to the conflict  by its relevant resolution  to undertake action on those lines . Along with Senegal and Ethiopia  and with the help of other fraternal countries that held intense and assiduous consultations and negotiations  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania is proud and honoured to have taken an active part in producing the compromise resolution that made it possible to name Morocco and POLISARIC explicitly as the two parties to the dispute  thus helping to create a general climate propitious to overcoming the psychological barriers that have hitherto prevented a proper appreciation of the Saharan question.84.	That is why we wish to put on record our distress of the fact that  during the meeting of the Implementation Committee on Western Sahara set by the OAU  held last September at Addis Ababa  one of the parties thought it necessary to reject the procedure advocated by that Committee in its efforts to put the Assembly's resolution into effect. We very much regret that  because it entails the risk of making a mockery of the tremendous hopes aroused by the consummation  in the Ethiopian capital  of so many years of effort and imagination. We therefore appeal to the fraternal country of Morocco to shoulder its responsibilities and agree  in its turn  to co-operate fully with the Implementation Committee by sitting down at the same negotiating table with its Saharan brothers.85.	What is at issue here is undoubtedly the building of our Arab Maghreb on a solid basis through the restoration of a just peace and fraternal co-operation between its peoples. Also at stake is the credibility of the OAU  and perhaps its very survival.86.	The United Nations should throw in the immense weight of its moral authority and give the various forms of assistance which may be requested of it in order to bring about a just settlement in Western Sahara. The Organization  which has been fully associated with the whole process  because Africa so willed it and also because of the Organization's global responsibilities  should in particular endorse the decision of the OAU Assembly  thus demonstrating the importance that the world community attaches to some of the fundamental principles of our time: the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination and independence  and the negotiated settlement of disputes.87.	Throughout the five continents we are increasingly witnessing a resurgence of serious violations of the principles of the sovereignty and independence of many countries.88.	In Afghanistan  the people have for several years now been undergoing a painful ordeal The Islamic Republic of Mauritania once again calls for the indispensable withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghan national territory  for respect for Afghanistan's sovereignty and its people's right to preserve the integrity of its national territory  thereby ensuring its progress in accordance with its historical heritage and its own specific social and cultural values.89.	As for South-East Asia  our country  which this year received the visit of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  repeats its previous appeals for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the national territory of Democratic Kampuchea. We also reaffirm Mauritania's attachment to the Declaration on Kampuchea adopted by the International Conference on Kampuchea  held in New York in July 198 and to all the relevant resolutions of the Organization demanding respect for the sovereignty of Kampuchea  the ending of external interference in its internal affairs  and respect .for the Khmer people's sovereign right to organize their national life freely and democratically. 90.	Generally speaking  we firmly condemn  as contrary to the traditions of the peaceful coexistence of States  the claim of large  medium-sized and small Powers that they have the unilateral  and immoral right to change by force a neighbouring country's regime if they subjectively deem it to be hostile to them.91.	Reasonable estimates are that by the year 2000 the population of our world will number about 6 billion. Faced with such a prospect  the Organization  and indeed all the States that make up the international community  have the responsibility of ensuring for these additional 2.5 billion men and women more acceptable conditions of life in a more peaceful  more equitable and more habitable world.92.	Such an objective presupposes  first of all  that the obsessive spectre of a nuclear holocaust  which without any doubt would be utterly devastating y d perhaps even fatal to any form of life on our beautiful planet  will be removed for ever from the human race.93.	This presupposes  too  that our community of nations will succeed in tempering the selfishness of the richest by  among other things  translating into concrete reality the interdependence of nations and the natural inclination of so many human beings to generosity and solidarity.94.	The restructuring and increase of development aid  the more general availability of the advances of science and technology  the easing of protectionist systems are all factors that could bring this world closer to equity through prosperity for all.95.	To be effective  economic justice must be accompanied by an improvement in international political relations.96.	Too many peoples are the victims of the usurpation of their countries; too many othersâin theory sovereign âhave been stripped of their sacred rights to self-fulfilment in accordance with their own choices  philosophical  political  economic and social.97.	Who can doubt that the stripping of entire peoples of their right to sovereignty  of which this Organization has been a passive witness  and the stifling of the fundamental liberties and social rights of hundreds of millions of human beings  pose an ethical problem which goes to the very heart of the Organization and the spirit and letter of the Charter?98.	This is also the true challenge of the end of the twentieth century  a century which will have brought men  both in terms of their social and political rights and in terms of their scientific and technological advances and the tolerant and mutual acceptance of their respective moral legacy  the most radical and decisive changes.99.	With faith in humanity  the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania ventures to hope that our human race will reverse its course towards self-destruction of our species and succeed in harnessing its ingenuity and its sometimes magnificent results achieved through the sacrifices and the laborious efforts of so many generations of people  to bring about a world where prosperity is equitably shared  a world of peace.

"95",4891,"MUS",38,1983,"ï»¿154.	 I am grateful to the Assembly for according me the honour of addressing this important body. I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Illueca on his election to the high and distinguished office of President of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to his country and to his own magnificent personal qualities. With his inspiring guidance  patience and tact  I am sure that our deliberations will lead to positive and meaningful results.155.	May I also thank the outgoing President most warmly for the moderation and diplomatic skill with which he presided over the thirty-seventh session of the Assembly.156.	The basic objective of the United Nations at the time of its creation 38 years ago was the maintenance of peace and security in the world. To a large extent the United Nations has lived up to thisâthere has been no global conflict.157.	We are thankful to the Secretary-General for carrying out his overwhelming task with faith and dedication to the cause of peace and justice. He has won our admiration for the efforts he has exerted. We in Africa are particularly appreciative of his diplomatic initiative aimed at securing the independence of Namibia in the very near future. We wish him to know that Mauritius will support whatever initiative he undertakes with a view to achieving that goal.158.	The year that has elapsed since I last addressed the Assembly has been an extremely difficult one for my country. We have gone through a period of political uncertainty; our Constitution was threatened and our democratic institutions imperilled. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that my people have been able  through scrupulous respect for our democratic process of government  to overcome the dangers that we faced. What might have been a politically traumatic period has proved to be a period of rapid development of our national identity and consciousness. I address the Assembly today as the representative of a nation proud of its institutions  confident of its future and determined to face the formidable challenges of development.159.	We are acutely aware of the fact that economic development does not come easily; it is not to be had for the asking. In their desire to protect their system  the developed nations are taking decisions which have a direct and grave impact on the economies of developing countries. The sentiment that what is good for the developed countries is necessarily good for developing countries demonstrates a certain indifference to the economic problems facing the latter. However  it is only fair that the developed countries should share with their less fortunate brothers in the third world the economic and other resources at their disposal. Such assistance should not  however  preclude relentless efforts in the third world countries themselves towards economic uplift and progress. We in the third world are conscious that ultimately our future lies in our own hands.160.	I wish to recall that Mauritius is an island State with a population of 1 million and that we are  by force of circumstances  an outward-looking people. Interdependence is for us a stark fact of daily life. Price changes on world commodity markets and exchange-rate fluctuations have a direct material effect on each and every Mauritian household. Internally  our policy is to favour the rapid growth of a fairly liberal market economy.161.	The pattern of trade relationships between the developed and the developing worlds is unfair  and we have to build a system which guarantees to the producers of raw materials and basic commodities remunerative prices which will make it possible to raise the living standards of the poor half of the world. The industrialized world tends to think that all the problems of the developing countries are of their own making and are the result of inappropriate domestic policies. Yet  we all know that many developing countries which like Mauritius have unhesitatingly adopted tough and unpopular economic measures and economic policy changes have still not made great progress because of external constraints. Our efforts at industrialization have been thwarted by protectionism in the developed countries. Agricultural exports do not obtain a remunerative export price  thereby discouraging agricultural production. High freight charges imposed by shipping companies belonging to the developed countries also make our exports uncompetitive. Faced with these difficulties  it is surprising that some developing nations have managed to avoid total bankruptcy. I would there- fare like to appeal to the developed countries to adopt a more realistic approach to the problems of development in our part of the world.162.	The flow of aid being mostly tied to projects  is slow and does not tackle the basic problems of balance- of-payments deficits in our countries. Hence most developing countries have had to seek assistance from IMF  the World Bank and other specialized financial institutions  which do not always take into consideration the social fabric of our countries. While we appreciate the assistance that my country and others have received from these institutions  we have found the conditions imposed by them difficult to meet. We have adopted a structural adjustment programme opening our economy to free competition  but unfortunately protectionism and the abuse of safeguard clauses in various international agreements have impeded our development.163.	The primary objective of foreign assistance is and must be to help the economic and social development of low-income countries  which in turn will promote stability globally. We would like to see a more liberal and understanding attitude from these institutions  especially in the case of small countries where policy options are limited. Donor countries should make a special effort to revise their aid policies so as to ensure a greater transfer of resources to the developing countries  especially bearing in mind the interdependence of the world economy.164.	While our major preoccupation is economic development  we in Mauritius are very much concerned with the numerous problems and conflicts that beset the world. The ideal of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace seems to develop day by day into a mere dream. Were it not for the dogged perseverance of the nations most directly concerned  the General Assembly's call for the Indian Ocean to be a zone of peace would have been buried under the combined weight of the arsenals of the superpowers in and around our ocean. From Cam Ranh Bay through Diego Garcia to Socotra  the Ocean is crisscrossed by sea lanes of terror that threaten our peace and security.165.	My Government hopes that the Committee on the Indian Ocean will in the near future complete the task of harmonizing views on the Conference on the Indian Ocean. We are aware that certain countries have adopted dilatory and obstructionist tactics on this subject and that others support the holding of this Conference for propaganda purposes only.166.	We will not allow the ideal of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace to be devalued into an empty slogan. We will support all moves to prohibit any military use of the peace zone by non-Indian-Ocean States which arrogate to themselves the right to threaten the nations of the region or to interfere in their internal affairs.167.	As a first step towards the realization of the zone of peace  we call upon the international community to ensure that no new bases are established and to impose a freeze in the existing military facilities in our region. As a further step we would wish to see a balanced and mutual downgrading of super-Power military presence in the Indian Ocean.168.	In conformity with our anti-militarist aspirations for our own region  we would like to see a reduction of armaments on a global scale. As Indian Ocean States we have the distinct impression that the Geneva disarmament talks are being utilized as a propaganda arena. We urge all parties concerned  in the interests of humanity at large  to imbue these talks with a greater degree of earnestness. Quite apart from the utter immorality of the nuclear arms race  we of the developing world deplore the senseless waste of resources in the deployment of nuclear weapons. The senseless competitive arms race is draining the world of vital resources that would have gone a long way towards alleviating the misery of millions who live below the poverty line.169.	I would like at this juncture to impress upon the Assembly the just and legitimate claim of my country over the Chagos Archipelago  which was excised from our national territory in contravention of General Assembly resolutions. 1 hope that in our endeavours to recover this part of our national territory by diplomatic and political means we shall continue to enjoy the unstilted support of all peace-loving countries.170.	We note with sadness that the world is still bedevilled by aggressions  conflicts and wars in such countries as Chad  Kampuchea  Afghanistan and Namibia  in the Middle East and in Latin America. The international community cannot remain insensitive to the untold sufferings of the peoples of these areas. The international community has a moral obligation in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to ensure that the inalienable rights of these peoples are not blatantly trampled upon and their problems aggravated by foreign interventions. It is their sacred right to determine their own future free from any external interference.171.	As we live in a world of shrinking dimensions whereby interdependence is the sine wow of the survival of mankind we must all strive tirelessly for lasting peace.172.	We in Africa cannot dissipate our energies in internecine conflicts and mindless fratricide while the illegal occupation of Namibia continues. We should focus our attention and our struggle on helping to liberate our brethren in South Africa. We wholeheartedly share the aspirations of our African brethren and will give them our full political and moral support in their struggle against racist domination.173.	1 would like here to reiterate our full support for the front-line States which daily bear the brunt of South African aggression. They too are victims  victims of the racist regime's effort to destabilize them.174.	We reject outright the spurious linkage between the presence of Cuban troops in Angola and the independence of Namibia. South Africa cannot perpetuate its illegal occupation of Namibia in complete disregard of United Nations resolutions and world public opinion.175.	We are dismayed and saddened by the senseless and fratricidal carnage taking place in Lebanon. We are convinced that the sectarian violence in that war-weary country would come to an end if all foreign intervention was to cease. The Lebanese people should be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination under international supervision.176.	The Palestinian cause has suffered a serious setback with the invasion of Lebanon and the cynical manipulation of factions within the Palestine Liberation Organization. It would be illusory for the invaders and manipulators to imagine that the Palestinian cause could be weakened by such manoeuvres. The Palestinian people will not be denied their identity as a nation and their inalienable right to a homeland.177.	In South-East Asia we are witnesses to ruthless cultural destruction in which the proud Khmers continue to suffer the occupation of their country. A rich and ancient civilization  nurtured patiently over several centuries  is being mercilessly destroyed and the genius of the Khmer people is being regimented out of existence. We are appalled by the lack of concern shown by the world for what has become an endangered people and a civilization facing extinction. The fact that this sore has festered for eight years does not in any way attenuate the urgency of finding a solution to it. We call for the immediate termination of the foreign occupation of Cambodia  the restoration of its non-aligned status and the re-establishment of the Cambodian people's right to self-determination in a truly independent country.178.	It saddens me to have a place on record the shock and sadness of the Government and people of Mauritius at the reported shooting down of the Korean Air Lines 747 plane. We deeply mourn the tragic loss of life and share the grief of the bereaved families. We deplore the total disregard of established norms of international civil aviation demonstrated in this incident. It is my country's earnest hope that the international community will adopt safety measures that will ensure that such a violation which imperils civilian air traffic and jeopardizes the lives of innocent passengers is not allowed to recur.179.	It is our belief that the Korean question should be taken up and resolved by Koreans themselves  through dialogue and negotiations. We believe in a peaceful solution to this question and in non-interference from outside in the search for that solution.180.	An end should be put to the sufferings of millions of persons separated from their families  and  in this connection  humanitarian considerations should guide all genuinely peace-loving nations of the international community.181.	Equally guided by purely humanitarian considerations  we have expressed sadness at the unfortunate events in Sri Lanka and have also expressed our confidence that the Sri Lankan authorities will successfully put an end to the risks to life and property to which a section of the population has been exposed.182.	The world is becoming increasingly interdependent  and although there are some areas where peace still eludes millions of people  there have been developments in the recent past which indicate an awareness on the part of the international community of the need to co-operate globally on specific issues.183.	The signing of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in December 1982 at Montego Bay is just one example of this process  and I am sure that the concept of the common heritage of mankind will become the cornerstone of co-operation in other areas of great concern to the international community. It is the wish of my country that a broader international body be set up to govern the immense ice-bound land mass known as Antarctica.184.	I have today addressed the Assembly as the newly elected socialist representative of an independent  non- aligned  democratic country. My Government is pledged to a foreign policy based on strict non-alignment  support for democratic ideals  advocacy of the right of peoples to self-determination and respect for the letter and the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and that of the OAU.185.	The United Nations is a unique organization of developed and developing countries. It has a special role to play in the harmonious development of relations between the two groups of countries which is vital to the common interest. I earnestly hope that the United Nations will mobilize its resources to promote greater international understanding and help free mankind from the scourges of war  gruesome poverty and economic insecurity. With the exercise of its collective will  this supreme world body can prove to be more effective for the sake of the welfare and future happiness of mankind. "
"96",4974,"MYS",38,1983,"ï»¿100.	 At the outset  may I  on behalf of the Malaysia delegation  compliment the President on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. His election is indeed a testimony of his vast experience and diplomatic skill  as well as a tribute to his country  Panama  with which my country enjoys cordial and friendly relations.101.	My delegation is concerned that the world continues to be confronted with various kinds of political  economic and security problems which the United Nations has not been able to resolve. We believe that this inability and ineffectiveness of the United Nations can be overcome if each Member State fulfils its moral obligation and duty to make the Organization work. Morality in international relations might be dismissed as something simply idealistic  but then idealism is something to be striven for. Certainly no one can deny that it is the lack of moral responsibility that makes nations trigger-happy towards other nations. It is for lack of moral responsibility that nations peddle weapons of death to each warring party and that national leaders conducting international relations calculate their moves on the mere basis of  them  and  us . Coming from a small country like mine  these observations may sound over-simplistic. But then  over-simplification does provoke thought  and this after all is what the United Nations forum is all about.102.	It is precisely because of these principles that the question of disarmament is a matter of serious concern to my delegation. The escalating arms race  particularly between the two super-Powers  is pushing us closer to the brink of destruction. It is incumbent on all members of the international community to exercise restraint and seriously address themselves to the issues relating to disarmament in order to defuse the state of tension and mistrust.103.	One of the most immediate and urgent problems facing us today is the question of Palestine. Indeed  it is relevant to the effectiveness and to the very future of this world body. This is because the question of Palestine embodies all those values and principles of morality  such as justice  human dignity  international peace and security  that the United Nationsâindeed humanity as a wholeâis called upon to uphold. Therefore  it is not surprising that some 137 States and the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  at the International Conference on the Question of Palestine held recently at Geneva  took a major step toward resolving the question of Palestine  the core of the West Asian conflict in all its aspects.104.	It is encouraging to note that major step  contained in the Geneva Declaration on Palestine  and the Programme of Action for the Achievement of Palestinian Rights/ in the formulation of which Malaysia was proud to play its small part  beginning with the Asian Regional Preparatory Meeting  held at Kuala Lumpur in May. Indeed  it provides the long-awaited basis for a just and comprehensive peace in West Asia in a clear and specific manner and within an applicable and realizable framework  one that seeks peace for the Palestinians within an independent and sovereign State of their own  co-existing with all other countries in the region within secure and internationally recognized boundaries. All concerned parties  including the PLO  are indeed required to sit at the same table to negotiate for themselves all the essential and final features of a permanent peace in the area.105.	Even though two Member States directly concerned had absented themselves from Geneva  their absence does not in any way diminish the Geneva consensus  which represents a universal endorsement for peace and security in the region. No one Member of this world body should therefore ignore or close its mind to this sincere and massive global effort and refuse to move in the direction of progress towards a settlement of the West Asian conflict  the crux and core of which is the question of Palestine. We therefore call upon all Member States  in particular the major Powers  to desist forthwith from any unilateral efforts and instead extend full support to the Geneva approach to peace and security  justice and human dignity for all the peoples of West Asia  including the Palestinians  under United Nations auspices.106.	The situation in Lebanon  which is an extension of the Arab-Israeli conflict  has caused deep distress in the international community. Malaysia is therefore constrained to express its gravest concern over the prolonged and escalating violence in that country  which could further complicate the search for peace. In this regard  Malaysia welcomes the recent cease-fire agreement in Lebanon. We urge all parties  in particular the major Powers  to exercise restraint and to refrain from any action that encourages renewed violence and further undermines the unity of the Lebanese people and the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon. A serious threat of the dismemberment of yet another small and helpless country exists  this time merely because of the stubbornness  arrogance and the total lack of respect for world opinion of one party  Israel. It is imperative  then  that Israel withdraw completely and unconditionally from Lebanon.107.	We continue to view the situation in Kampuchea with serious concern. We are saddened that the peace- loving people of Kampuchea have had to struggle against such terrible injustice for so long  resulting in misery  flight and the sorry plight of Kampuchean refugees in neighbouring Thailand. We are furthermore concerned by the continued Vietnamese military occupation  in violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations  which poses a grave threat to the peace and stability of South-East Asia as well as to international peace and security.108.	As ASEAN emphasized in a joint appeal recently  the central goal of that Association's efforts in the resolution of the Kampuchean question is the survival of the Kampuchean nation and the restoration of its independence and sovereignty. Malaysia and its ASEAN partners have shown all possible flexibility so as to achieve this goal in a manner that manifests respect for international principles and takes into account the legitimate concerns of the parties directly involved. This is why the total withdrawal of foreign forces  the exercise of self-determination and national reconciliation are the essential elements of a peaceful solution. In this light ASEAN would consider the partial withdrawal of Vietnamese troops to be credible if it were to constitute part of a total withdrawal.109.	However  we are greatly distressed to learn from recent reports that Viet Nam is engaged in changing the demographic character of Kampuchea. This attempt at the Vietnamization of Kampuchea must cease. This utter lack of respect for human dignity is to our mind no less serious than the crimes previously committed against the Kampuchean people.110.	Notwithstanding the serious obstacles to peace  Malaysia  together with the other ASEAN partners  will continue vigorously to pursue the objective of a peaceful solution. For ASEAN  there is indeed no alternative to regional peace but the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia. We are encouraged by the increasing effectiveness of the Government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk  and we are confident that this will enhance the prospect of a comprehensive political solution. We urge the international community to provide every assistance possible to this Government to facilitate the restoration of independence and sovereignty to Kampuchea. We earnestly hope that Viet Nam will participate positively in the efforts to find a peaceful solution to this question so as to remove a serious obstacle to the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia.111.	For four years the Afghan people  like the Kampuchean people  have been the victims of aggression and military occupation. It is therefore most distressing that  despite universal disapproval  anger and protest  the Soviet Union remains oblivious of world opinion. In fact  this aggression against a peace-loving people and the occupation of its country will remain in the forefront of world attention and will continue to be opposed by the international community. While Malaysia supports the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about a negotiated settlement  the Soviet Union must show greater sincerity and earnestness concerning this United Nations peace process so that an early solution consistent with the relevant resolutions of this and other international bodies may be found.112.	Another question of concern to us is the continuing conflict between Iran and Iraq  two countries with which Malaysia enjoys close and friendly relations. Malaysia welcomes the efforts of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  of whose Peace Committee Malaysia is a member  to bring to an end that tragic conflict.113.	In southern Africa  the problems of Namibia andstill pose a serious threat to peace and security in the region. In this context  we await with keen anticipation the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which would grant independence to Namibia. I understand that the United Nations is in a state of readiness to play its own part with the administrative and operational arrangements. I should like to reiterate that the Government of Malaysia is prepared to contribute to peace-keeping efforts in that Territory. Unfortunately  a solution to the Namibian problem remains elusive  since the South African regime predicates the independence of Namibia on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.114.	The policy of apartheid of the South African regime constitutes a travesty of justice and an affront to human dignity. Malaysia will continue to support fully the cause of the oppressed people of South Africa in their struggle for equality  justice and dignity.115.	While the world grapples with its already numerous problems  it has to contend with yet another incident which poses a direct threat  this time to international civil aviation. My delegation recalls with horror and shock the shooting down of a South Korean commercial airliner on I September 1983  in which all the passengers  including women and children  perished  making it the worst disaster in the history of civil aviation. We cannot but express deep regret at the callous disregard for human lives  in serious violation of accepted international norms and conventions. In the interest of the safety of international civil aviation and in the name of humanity  Malaysia associates itself with and supports any move  through the various international organizations  to ensure that the safety of the lives of air travellers will never again be threatened.116.	We share the sorrow of the South Korean people as a result of this incident. But hardly a month had passed before the South Koreans had to experience yet another painful tragedy  when four of their ministers and 11 others were killed in Rangoon. The people and Government of Malaysia condemn this cowardly act and extend their deep sympathy to the Korean people in this hour of grief.117.	Another problem which my delegation considers to be closely related to national security is that of the abuse of and illicit traffic in drugs. In the United Nations the conceptual approach to the drug problem has always placed it in the social and humanitarian context. Little consideration is given to treating this matter as a national security problem  which remains the main concern of Malaysia  where 60 per cent to 70 per cent of crimes committed are related to drug abuse. Many deaths among our youth are caused by drug overdoses. As long as the problem is not considered within the framework of its political and security ramifications  international cooperation would at best only give minimal results  as it would not commensurate with the gravity and seriousness of the problem. Therefore  step  should be taken to ensure universal recognition of the drug problem as a national security problem so that it can receive greater priority at the international level.118.	At the thirty-seventh session  the Prime Minister of my country stated that it was timely for the United Nations to focus its attention on Antarctica  the last undeveloped continent on earth  which remains outside national jurisdiction. With the recent adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  which represents a milestone of progress in mankind's endeavour to preserve what left of the planet's surface beyond national jurisdiction  now is an appropriate time for the international community to be prepared to apply the concept of common heritage and common benefit to Antarctica  concerning which there is now growing international interest and a desire for universal involvement.119.	While generally little is known about Antarctica  the economic potential  both mineral and marine  is believed to be vast  though we have been told its exploitation is not technically feasible at present. The 1959 Antarctic Treaty   although open to all Members of the United Nations  is restrictive and exclusive in nature. It is also discriminatory  since only the Consultative Parties can make decisions concerning the continent. Other Contracting Parties to the treaty are mere participants.120.	The present arrangement regarding Antarctica has created inequities which cannot be allowed to continue. Inevitably  those inequities will lead to instability. It is the position of my Government that Antarctica  as the common heritage of mankind  should be accessible to all nations irrespective of the degree of their economic or scientific development and capabilities. The exploration  exploitation and planning of the conservation of its resources should be carried out for the benefit of mankind. Antarctica should forever be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and should not become the scene or object of international discord. The heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries  at their seventh conference  in March  shared those convictions when they agreed that the United Nations  at the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  should undertake a comprehensive study of Antarctica with the view to widening international co-operation in the area.121.	The goal of our request  together with Antigua and Barbuda  to inscribe the question of Antarctica in the agenda	  b to have the Secretary-General undertake a comprehensive study of Antarctica in consultation with all parties and taking into account all relevant factors. We are happy that the General Assembly has agreed to this request. It is our sincere belief that with co-operation from all  the study to be undertaken would benefit mankind.122.	The international economic situation remains uncertain  although there are signs of recovery. Optimists herald them as symptoms of better times  while pessimists warn of a false start. The developing countries continue to grapple with severe debt problems and low commodity prices with no improvements in sight. Malaysia believes that current international economic problems require a restructuring of the international economic system. In a world that is so closely interdependent  solutions to common problems will not be possible without co-operation between the developed and the developing countries. The latter  however  should not lose sight of the vast potential of co-operating among themselves in a process to build up collective self-reliance. Developing countries could engage in increased trade activities among themselves and co-operate in numerous areas of activity to ensure continuing development.123.	Malaysia believes in South-South co-operation. Indeed  we participate fully in various programmes of economy co-operation among developing countries. Malaysia's contribution to promoting this spirit of self- reliance is the Malaysian Technical Co-operation Programme  a modest programme through which we share with friendly developing countries our know-how and experiences in economic development.124.	Like other developing countries  Malaysia  as a major primary commodity producer  has felt the negative effects of depressed prices for our commodities. Our earlier hope that international commodity agreements would help stabilize prices was disproved by the lack of good will  co-operation and political will from consumer countries. Nevertheless  Malaysia still maintains its faith in international commodity arrangements  as manifested when it ratified the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities last month. Malaysia hopes that this will pave the way for the major consumer countries to sign and ratify the Agreement to help realize the operation of the Fund as an example of international cooperation in commodity arrangements.125.	At this session  we warmly welcome to our midst the newly independent State of Saint Christopher and Nevis as the 158th Member of the United Nations. The entry of Saint Christopher and Nevis into the Organization bears testimony to the faith and confidence that many nations have in this body.126.	In concluding my statement  I should like to reiterate my earlier appeal in calling on all Members of the United Nations  particularly the permanent members of the Security Council  to give their fullest support  cooperation and confidence in order to generate the necessary political will required to revitalize the Organization so that the cherished ideals and aspirations of the founding fathers as enshrined in the Charter can forever be upheld."
"97",5047,"NER",38,1983,"ï»¿163.	Mr. President  the Niger delegation welcomed with a feeling of profound satisfaction your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We therefore associate ourselves with the warm congratulations addressed to you on your assumption of that highly responsible office in which we are certain you will  as Mr. Hollai last year  do useful work. A man of thought  but also a man of action  in the course of a long rich political career in the service of your country  Panama  in the United Nations and in other international bodies  you have acquired the competence and experience necessary for guiding our work.164.	Above and beyond your undeniable and universally recognized qualities as an eminent statesman  we also see in you the worthy representative of that heroic land  Latin America  whose will has never faltered and where freedom  peace and progress have always found a powerful echo. Throughout the ages  as history shows  generations of men and women have fought with faith and courage on your continent for the triumph of those ideals which constitute the raison dâÃªtre of the United Nations and the backdrop for its action. In the torn and anguished world in which we live today  the General Assembly  by electing you  could make no wiser choice to advance the cause of peace  freedom and progress.165.	We live in a world tom  anguished  deeply concerned and desperately in search of peace  freedom and progress. This is the same painful and bitter assessment that we made last year at the thirty-seventh session and unfortunately we must make it again this year. In fact  observers are unanimous in considering the present international situation to be no better than it was last year and even seriously and dangerously worse.166.	East-West relations are more tense than ever. The arms race  which has known no respite  has now reached a fearsome thresholds A report on world military and social expenditures published last Friday in Washington by the Association for Weapons Control and the Rockefeller Foundation indicates that every minute $1.3 million are spent throughout the world for military purposes. Furthermore  none of the serious conflicts affecting the world for years has been resolved. Worse still  we see a dangerous expansion of those conflicts and sometimes the appearance of new hotbeds of tension in the same regions  in other cases in regions hitherto spared or enjoying relative calm.167.	Hence  Asia and the Middle East seem permanently immersed in war. There is war in Central America as well  where armed confrontations intensify day by day and threaten to spread to the entire Latin American continent. There is also war in the north-west and southern parts of the African continent. In other areas of the world  particularly in the Korean peninsula  tension remains strong and could at any time degenerate into open armed conflict because of hatred and passions fuelled and maintained for many years. Elsewhere  as a reaction to oppression  domination  exploitation or the denial of fundamental human rights  violence threatens to break out. Nothing is going right for our world as far as peace and security are concerned.168.	In the area of international co-operation too we have little cause for satisfaction. Because of the selfishness of the richest countries  under the pressure of protectionist measures and because of continued disorder in the international monetary system  the Held for co-operation has considerably narrowed.169.	The serious crisis which for years has been afflicting the world economy is today affecting all international economic  trade and financial relations  with the negative consequences with which we are all familiar: inflation  recession and unemployment in most of our countries  a slowing down or complete halt of the development process in the developing countries because of a marked decrease of development aid in real terms  increasingly difficult conditions for access to financial markets and the further deterioration of their terms of trade. To a large number of those countries the crisis in the world economy constitutes today a real question of life or death.170. Undoubtedly the overall situation in our world on this thirty-eighth anniversary of the Organization is highly dramatic and disquieting. The Secretary-General is right in Arming in his report on the work of the Organization: Despite the efforts of many  1983 has  so far  been a frustrating year for the search for peace  stability and justice and for those who believe that the United Nations is the best available international instrumentality to achieve these ends. 171.	The many upheavals of a political  economic or social nature tearing the world apart or threatening it are a reflection of a major requirementâthat for a profound change of the whole system of international relations. If war and poverty continue to afflict a large part of mankind  in spite of the identification of the problems confronting our world and an increase in our capacity to deal with those problems  especially because of the progress in science and technology  and in spite of a growing awareness of the interdependence of our nations and the dangers threatening them  the reason is undeniably  e system of international relations itself  one which is b< d on relations of power  might  domination and exploitation and is characterized by a widespread disorder which some zealously perpetuate.172.	It is a fact that the world is divided into rich and poor countries  into powerful and weak countries  but the fact that some are rich and powerful in no way confers upon them a right over the others that are poor and weak. In particular  it does not confer upon them the right to divide the world into spheres of influence that they can directly or indirectly control. Nor does it confer upon them the right of life and death over others  any more than it authorizes them to use the power they possess to intervene and to impose their will or their desires on others. It gives them no preferential title to the riches of the world or the exclusive right to set the conditions under which international trade and international finances should be managed.173.	There can be no doubt that the destiny of our world cannot be left in the hands of a few countries  however powerful. There are among us no peoples chosen to command others. We form part of the same humanity to which we so enthusiastically refer in our statements. Rich or poor  powerful or weak  we are the inhabitants of the same planet  Earth  and if tomorrow a nuclear war breaks out we should all have to bear its lethal consequences. There is no need for us to stress that we are all experiencingâin varying degrees  it is trueâthe negative effects of the serious crisis in the world economy.174.	This means that we all have an equal interest to work to wards a relaxation of tensions in the world and towards the establishment of an atmosphere of trust  entente and comprehension among our different nations  making it possible for us to progress on the path towards disarmament. It also means that it is in the interest of all to preserve international peace and security. Lastly  it indicates how important it is for all our countries to develop the ideal of international co-operation and to seek  in a spirit of complementarity and solidarity  solutions to the problems of hunger and unemployment in the world  to the world monetary problems  to the debt problems of the third world countries  to the increasing deterioration of their terms of trade and development financing difficulties.175.	Those are the requirements of the world of today. It is to meet them that the third world countries are  through the policy of non-alignment  endeavouring to promote a new and broader vision of international relations based on overcoming bloc rivalry  which generates tension  and on a determined search for peace and cooperation among all the nations of the earth. The initiative taken at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries to invite the world's leaders to participate personally in the work of the General Assembly's thirty-eighth session attests to the resolve of those countries to contribute to the reduction of international tensions  to the solution of the conflicts dividing the world and to the establishment of an entirely new world order capable of guaranteeing for our human race that peace and security so lacking and so necessary for progress.176.	Being a full-fledged member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  Niger is pleased that a large number of world leaders have welcomed that initiative. I should like   on behalf of President Kountche  to pay a tribute to the Prime Minister of India  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  whose action has been decisive in making this idea a reality.177.	With regard to the general situation in the world  we have  as members of the family of the United Nations  many tasks to accomplish  many challenges to meet. However  we must recognize the urgent and fundamental need to tackle the many conflicts that are afflicting and bringing destruction to many regions of our world.178.	I have in mind especially the southern part of the African continent  where the credibility of the United Nations is being sorely tested by the continued and illegal occupation of Namibia by the racist minority regime of Pretoria and the persistence of the criminal policy of179.	It is true that various bodies of the Organization have adopted an impressive number of resolutions on the situation in Namibia. The General Assembly has regularly considered this question during the past 37 years at its regular sessions. Two special sessionsâthe fifth and the ninthâand also a special emergency sessionâthe eighth âhave been dedicated to it. The Security Council itself has taken up the matter and has adopted at least 20 resolutions  including resolution 435 (1978)  which lays the foundations for a peaceful  just and equitable settlement of the problem. At the same time missions of inquiry and mediation have been dispatched. Many meetings have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations itself and upon the initiative of many other well-meaning bodies in order to ensure the implementation of the provisions of that resolution. In spite of all these efforts  we have made hardly any progress. The General Assembly and the Security Council  to use the customary language of this Organization  remain seized of the question of Namibia.180.	This is so because the flexible and constructive attitude of SWAPO in the negotiations undertaken for the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) has met with the downright stubbornness and delaying tactics of the racist minority regime of Pretoria at the diplomatic level  while in practice that regime has pursued a savage policy of repression against the Namibian nationalists and has engaged in repeated acts of aggression against the frontline States.181.	Responsibility for the failure of our efforts is well known. All the covert or overt alliances  all the complicity and the tolerance which encourage South Africa in its negative attitude  are also well known. They make it possible for South Africa steadfastly to flout and defy the United Nations and give it the extra energy it needs whenever internal pressure endangers the existence of the proponents of apartheid.182.	In these circumstances  how can we not share the concern of the International Conference in Support of the Struggle of the Namibian People for Independence  held in Paris in April 1983  over the fact that thus far  the Security Council has been unable to fulfil its responsibilities regarding the maintenance of international peace and security  because of the opposition of a permanent member? Yet it appears obvious that the sanctions envisaged under Chapter VII of the Charter  effectively and universally applied  are the only available means to compel South Africa to comply with the decisions of the United Nations.181. In solidarity with the Namibian people and with the oppressed populations of South Africa and the frontline States  Niger deeply deplores the delaying tactics which characterize the search for a solution to the problem of that region. Niger repudiates any link between the independence of Namibia and situations relating to the sovereignty of other States. We favour true independence for Namibia  based on Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  and consequently call for determined action by the international community to put an end to the occupation of Namibia and to the policy of apartheid  both of which it has unanimously condemned.Closer to the borders of my country  in Chad  which for over 15 years has been torn asunder by a fratricidal war  a dangerous situation has developed recently  which was referred  without much effect  to the Security Council. As a neighbour of Chad  we feel a sense of pain as we witness the suffering endured by the people of Chad and the slow decline of the whole State because of the long years of war. We have never tried to take advantage of the chaotic situation in Chad. And in spite of the repercussions of the situation on our borders  of which little is known in the outside world  we have never been willing to add to the difficulties of that country. That is why we have never chosen to side with one faction against another. We have always believed that Chad belongs to the Chadian people and that it is they themselves who must settle the problems of Chad. Our role has always been to alleviate the suffering of our Chadian brothers and to help them in their recovery. It is in that spirit that we have participated in all the efforts undertaken to restore peace in that country.185.	Today our position remains unchanged. We consider Chad to be one and indivisible and consequently we call for respect for its unity and integrity. By the same token  we believe that the independence and sovereignty of Chad must be respected; foreign interference in its internal affairs must therefore be brought to an end.186.	It is the duty of the international community  it is the duty of African countries and  in particular  of the neighbours of Chad  to help in restoring peace in that country. Niger ardently hopes that the efforts of the OAU to that end will be strongly supported by all.187.	No one today would dispute the fact that the situation in the Middle East is a serious and constant threat to international peace and security. Lebanon  with the siege of Beirut  the forced departure of the Palestinian leaders to other lands of exile  followed by the Shatila and Sabra massacres and a resurgence of violence  of which there is fresh news every day  is an example of the great tragedy which for decades has been afflicting the countries and people of the Middle East. At the heart of that tragedy we find the fate of the Palestinian people  victim of one of the greatest injustices of our time.188.	As a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and of its Al-Quds Committee  and as a crossroads for centuries for exchanges of all types between Africa and the Arab world  Niger is deeply concerned over the situation affecting that part of the world.189.	The United Nations  the Non aligned Movement  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the OAU and many other international bodies have done their utmost to find a just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East and of Palestine. The International Conference on the Question of Palestine  which recently took place at Geneva  provides an example of the seriousness of those efforts. All those efforts  unfortunately  come up against the arrogance  intransigence and rage for war of the State of Israel  which continues the occupation of Arab and Palestinian territories and constantly attacks neighbouring States  despite the relevant decisions of the General Assembly.190.	I wish to reaffirm Niger's support for the valiant Palestinian people and the PLO  which is its sole and legitimate representative. I also reaffirm our support for the Arab countries and peoples of the region in their struggle to regain their territories which are illegally occupied by Israel.191.	We continue to believe that a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the question of the Middle East and Palestine necessarily involves the total withdrawal by Israel from Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem; recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and its right to the establishment of an independent and sovereign State on the soil of its homeland  in Palestine  under the leadership of the PLO; and the PLO's full participation in any peacekeeping process.192.	It is not only in Chad  southern Africa and the Middle East where world peace is in danger; it is also in danger in other regions. One example is the Persian Gulf  where Iran and Iraq are still at war. We are deeply affected by the continued confrontation between those two countries  to which we are bound by so many links  and we call for an end to hostilities and to a peaceful settlement of the dispute.193.	Other examples are provided by Afghanistan and Democratic Kampuchea; we should like to see those countries free and rid of foreign occupation and their independence  sovereignty and status as non-aligned States fully respected.194.	Unfortunately Central America is yet another example  a region where serious upheavals and dangerous instability have recently degenerated into open warfare. We hope for a negotiated settlement of the problems of that region that will take full account of the aspirations of the people concerned and respect the independence and sovereignty of all the States of the region. For that reason we are supporting and encouraging the efforts of the Contadora Group.195.	Similarly  we favour a political solution to the problem of the division of Korea. Only a negotiated solution can guarantee a just and final settlement of that question and thereby avoid plunging the Korean people into the torments of a new war.196.	I do not feel that I have exhausted the list of all the flashpoints in the world. Could it ever be exhausted? There are still other regions of the world where peace is fragile  threatened or broken. I should simply like to add in this regard that we in Niger wish peace for all countries and all peoples on earth  for we know the inestimable benefits that it brings.197.	In fact it is that peace which has enabled us on the morrow of the accession to power in April 1974 of the Supreme Military Council to take effective action to overcome the immediate harmful effects of the terrible drought which Niger and the other countries of the Sahel have had to endure. It is that peace which has enabled us to carry out the qualitative changes needed before we could undertake a three-year programme  and then a five- year plan  devised by the Supreme Military Council as part of a bold policy of national recovery. Today we can be proud of having protected the population of Niger against famine; of having rebuilt our livestock inventory  75 per cent of which had been destroyed by drought; of having increased arable land  through a sustained policy of hydro-agricultural improvements and additional water supplies  thereby substantially increasing food production; of having improved and strengthened the health and education infrastructures; of having developed our road system and given our country modern telecommunications infrastructures.198.	The vast programme of national mobilization undertaken under the guidance of the development association has also been carried out successfully. After four years of intensive work in publicity  information and study  the National Committee charged with setting up the development association prepared a report listing the problems facing our country and proposing ways of solving them.199.	In parallel with these studies  we undertook organizational work  setting up in neighbourhoods  villages  cantons and in each district and department development groups consisting of peasants  young people  schoolchildren and all the social and professional strata of our country. This organizational work was concluded on 3 August 1983 with the solemn establishment of the National Council for Development  which has been given a mandate to draw up a national charter reflecting the aspirations of the Nigerian people as they appeared at the time of the great work of study and research which preceded the establishment of all of these institutions. This charter will serve as a framework for action for the public authorities and as a code of conduct for the whole nation.200. Only a few days agoâin fact  exactly a week ago  as reflected in press agency dispatchesâthis image of a peaceful and hardworking Niger was endangered. A group of armed men  whose motive and allegiance we do not know  attempted to seize power and to put an end to this process developed by the people of Niger itself for its own well-being. This deadly enterprise lasted only a few hours and was dealt a crushing Mow  thanks to the firmness of our national armed forces and the vigilance of our people. The Supreme Military Council and the Government remain determined  whatever the price and whatever the obstacles  whatever efforts at sabotage and destabilization might be carried out  to pursue this original experiment in social living  in apprenticeship in democracy and in concerted action and committed solidarity  undertaken in unity and cohesion by the people of Niger. For us this represents a powerful hope.201.	In conclusion I would say that the same applies to the United Nations. In spite of its defects  in spite of its drawbacks and its failures  the United Nations symbolizes and personifies the hopes of mankind for peace and economic and social progress. It may one day become the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends. Our task is to desire this and to help to bring it about. This is done every day with dedication and conviction by the Secretary-General. On behalf of Niger  I congratulate him  just as I congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis which  through its presence  has strengthened our faith in the value of the work we are doing here."
"98",5092,"NGA",38,1983,"ï»¿232.	 Mr. President  I should like  first of all  to join the preceding speakers in extending to you  on behalf of the Government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  my warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. You have assumed the presidency of this august Assembly at a particularly difficult time when the international situation is under considerable strain  with the eruption of conflicts and tensions in virtually all regions of the world and the apparent collapse of detente between the two super-Powers. Your outstanding diplomatic skills  patience and wisdom will be severely tested in the months ahead. But we are confident that under your able leadership  guidance  the General Assembly will make substantial progress towards the attainment of an enduring global peace and security.233.	I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  our deep appreciation and gratitude for the able and effective manner in which he guided the General Assembly in its deliberations in the past year. We were deeply impressed by his exertions in promoting the cause of peace throughout the world. He proved extremely adroit in his handling of very delicate and sensitive issues. The failures of this Assembly  however  particularly in reaching agreement on several critical issues  such as the launching of the global economic negotiations  cannot be blamed on him. Collectively  we bear responsibility for those failures.234.	I should also like  on behalf of my Government and the people of Nigeria  to welcome Saint Christopher and Nevis to membership in the United Nations and to express our conviction that it will make a positive contribution to the search for global peace and security.235.	Since the last session of this body there has been a steady and disturbing deterioration of the international situation. It has reached such crisis proportions that there is now universal concern that the world is now tottering on the brink of war.236.	The global eruption of crises  conflicts and tensions has been further aggravated by the massive build-up of arms  especially nuclear weapons  which now represent the gravest danger to international peace and security and to the very survival of mankind itself. Ignoring mankind's pleas and appeals for sanity  the super-Powers in particular have embarked not only upon a massive accumulation of weaponry  but also a qualitative improvement of such weapons. Negotiations on arms reduction and disarmament at the various forums have continued to founder on the rock of rivalry and deep mistrust between the two super-Powers. Instead of making a steady and progressive effort towards achieving nuclear disarmament  the two Powers are hell-bent on achieving nuclear deterrence through a further expansion of their already awesome arsenals.237.	Doomsday may well be on our doorstep now. That is why it is absolutely essential for the two super-Powers to seek  peace through co-operation  instead of adopting confrontation as a substitute for negotiation. In a futile attempt to achieve global hegemony and world domination for themselves  they have resorted to proxy wars in all regions of the world where the clearly expressed will of the people for peace  prosperity and stability is being subverted and steadily undermined through the threat and use of force. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of States  all of which are entitled to the protection of the United Nations  are being daily undermined in Chad  Nicaragua  Lebanon  Kampuchea and Afghanistan under one pretext or another and in defence of highly questionable and dubious principles and values. The most sophisticated weapons are being rapidly deployed in what is clearly an unbridled and disconcerting arrogation of power. Direct and indirect interference by the super-Powers in the internal and external affairs of small and weak States are now in the ascendancy in every region of the world.238.	Nigeria is deeply concerned about these trends  which are clearly detrimental to peaceful coexistence among all States. The situation calls urgently for concerted global action to ensure the security of weak and small States  as well as their freedom from external interference in their internal affairs. The relaxation of tensions has become the urgent priority of the international community  but this essential goal cannot be attained through such negative concepts as the balance of terror  spheres of influence  deterrence and alien domination. Small and weak States have as much right as the big Powers to develop along their own freely chosen paths without any external interference or pressure. Efforts should be intensified at the international level actively to promote the principles of peaceful coexistence and self- determination through the conclusion of the process of decolonization.239.	Let me now refer particularly to the situation in southern Africa  which also continues to be a matter of utmost concern to my Government. For nearly four decades now  the racist policies of the South African white minority regime have been roundly condemned in this Hall as well as in the Security Council. Our concern is not merely that racial discrimination exists in South Africa  but that it has been institutionalized  enshrined in law and made all-pervasive. All attempts at a peaceful change through necessary reforms have failed. Frustration among the blacks has made them resort to armed struggle to eradicate the apartheid system. Unless there is a fundamental change in South Africa through recognition of the inherent right of the 20 million blacks to participate fully and equally with the whites in South Africa's political and economic processes  there is a grave danger of a catastrophic racial conflict that will have serious ramifications throughout the world.240.	If South Africa continues to spurn all appeals for a change and fails to deal justly and effectively with its racial problem  that failure will impose heavy economic  military and political penalties on its allies in the Western countries. The response and attitude of most of the Western countries to the racial problem in South Africa is not only most disappointing  but also self-defeating. Publicly they routinely join in the world-wide condemnation of South Africa's racist doctrines  but privately they continue to pursue policies which only encourage the racist regime in its intransigence. They do not support the application of the necessary economic and political pressures on South Africa to compel it to embark on the necessary eradication of its obnoxious racist doctrines. When we call for sanctions  we are told by the Western allies of racist South Africa either that the imposition of sanctions will not work or that it is incompatible with their fundamental belief in the principle of global free trade. Yet these powerful countries are quick and eager to resort to economic sanctions in less compelling situations. There is no question but that the racist regime of South Africa has enjoyed the encouragement  support and approval of these Western States in its arrogant rejection of am peaceful efforts to bring about the urgently desired changes in the country. Not only have the major Western Powers failed to take action against the apartheid regime in accordance with their commitments and obligations under the Charter of the United Nations  but they have directly  openly and covertly assured the racist regime of its survival and prosperity through vastly increased economic co-operation. At the recent Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  held at Geneva  the duplicity of the Western Powers was once again unmasked when they failed to join the consensus in the Programme of Action adopted by the Conference against theapartheid regime and its Israeli collaborators.241.	The so-called policy of constructive engagement with the apartheid regime is deeply offensive and repugnant to Africa and to decent men and women throughout the world. It is nothing but a cover for the sinister motives of the United States and others for continuing their policy of support for the	regime in southern Africa  and we reject it completely since it is open encouragement to the racist regime. Contrary to the claim of the present United States Administration  it is not a balanced policy. Within the framework of this policy we have seen increased diplomatic  political  economic and military cooperation between the racist regime of South Africa and its Western allies. At the United Nations the United States has assured the racist regime of South Africa of diplomatic cover by vetoing all efforts to impose punitive measures on that regime for its repeated acts of aggression against its neighbours as well as for its refusal to withdraw from Namibia. It would not even permit a condemnation of racist South Africa for its invasion and continued occupation of Angola. How can such a policy which supports the aggressor be regarded as balanced or constructive?242.	The recent approval by the Government of the United States of the request by seven United States corporations to provide technical and maintenance services to a nuclear power installation in racist South Africa is in violation of Security Council resolutions 418 (1977) and 473 (1980). This approval is being granted despite the well-known objections of Africa and the international community to any form of nuclear co-operation or collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa.243.	It is particularly regrettable that this approval was granted despite the persistent refusal of apartheid South Africa to allow inspection and verification of its nuclear installation by IAEA. We hope that in view of the objections raised not only by the whole of Africa but also by the international community  the United States authorities will cancel this contract  which is clearly detrimental to the cause of peace and freedom in Africa.244.	Recently  authoritative statements were made by Washington to the effect that peace and security in southern Africa could be restored only if the so-called security concerns of the apartheid regime were met. Let me make it abundantly clear that we are unable to accept the notion that the racist regime of South Africa has any legitimate security concerns which have to be met by African States. Equally  the proposition that the African States in the region should seek peaceful coexistence with the racist regime of South Africa is most objectionable  and we reject it completely. It is apartheid South Africa that has consistently sought to undermine the peace  security and stability of the region by its incessant and unprovoked aggression against its neighbours. Collectively and separately  African States in the region have never posed  and could not now pose  any threat to the security of racist South Africa. None of them has ever attacked South Africa. In contrast  troops from the racist regime of South Africa now occupy much of southern Angola. It is the security concerns of the front-line States and not those of the apartheid regime that should be met.245.	The apartheid regime stands universally condemned for its persistent  unjustified and unprovoked aggression and acts of destabilization against the frontline States. Recently the racist regime closed its borders with Lesotho in order to force that country to deny political refuge to those fleeing from Pretoria's persecution. When Lesotho turned to the Western allies of the racist regime  it met with a stony silence from them. Lesotho's independence and sovereignty mean nothing to them. Yet these countries which continue to collaborate with the apartheid regime would have the world believe that they are the defenders of freedom throughout the world. Africa is not and cannot be deceived by the duplicity of these Powers.246.	With regard to the situation in Namibia  my Government would like to express its deep appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts to bring about the independence of that Territory. As he discovered during his recent mission to South Africa  all outstanding constitutional issues within the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) had in fact been resolved during proximity talks with the contact group last year. South Africa's insistence on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola as a precondition for Namibia's independence is merely a red herring  a pretext for pursuing other sinister objectives in Angola. Neither Angola itself  nor the presence of Cuban forces there at the invitation of the Angolan Government can conceivably be represented as a threat to the security of South Africa  which now occupies one third of Angola's territory. Without the withdrawal of South Africa's forces from Angola  the cessation of support for the UNIT A? bandits and reasonable assurances and guarantees about Angola's security  Angola cannot reasonably be expected to terminate its security arrangements with Cuba.247.	It is the view of my Government that nothing short of the application of economic and other sanctions will bring racist South Africa to its senses. For decades all international appeals to apartheid South Africa have fallen on deaf ears. There is no longer any valid excuse or explanation for South Africa's continued intransigence except that it hopes and  indeed  believes that those Western countries that profit from the apartheid system will continue to thwart all efforts to impose sanctions on that regime.248.	Clearly  the situation in southern Africa  particularly the persistent refusal of the racist regime to withdraw from Namibia  now calls for the invoking of the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Those provisions  including recourse to sanctions as a punitive measure  were intended to deal with precisely the kind of situation we now have in southern Africa. Those permanent members of the Security Council which continue to prevent the Council from discharging its full responsibility by protecting the racist regime from sanctions bear a very heavy moral and historical responsibility for their reprehensible policy. They have left the people of South Africa and Namibia with no choice other than to seek redress through armed struggle. The Government and people of Nigeria will continue to provide them with all necessary support to enable them to wage their war of liberation against the racists. We have a moral obligation to do so  for our own independence and freedom will remain incomplete as long as these unhappy people continue to be held in bondage.249.	My Government is equally concerned about the increasingly dangerous interventionist policy being pursued in Africa by some external Powers in Western Sahara  in the Horn of Africa and  more recently  in Chad. Localized disputes in these areas have been aggravated by foreign intervention  thus making it increasingly difficult for our continental organization  the OAU  to exercise fully its functions and responsibilities for resolving those disputes. We strongly condemn all external Powers that have intervened in Chad. Their intervention has added to the suffering and misery of the people of Chad. We therefore join in the call for the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from Chad. The people of Chad must be allowed to resolve their differences without any external intervention. Africa must not be turned into an arena for proxy wars waged by the superpowers.250.	The Middle East has continued to be a major centre of conflicts and tensions because of Israel's expansionist policy and aggression. My Government strongly deplores Israel's refusal to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981)  which  we believe  provides the basis for a resolution of the Middle East problem. Israel's attempt to annex the Syrian Golan Heights  the invasion of Lebanon and the outrage of the massacres at Sabra and Shatila are an ample demonstration of Israel's complete disregard of international opinion and of the decisions of both the Security Council and the General Assembly. Nigeria is strongly opposed to those policies and will continue to support the people of Palestine in their just and legitimate demand for a homeland of their own. It is our firm conviction that a durable settlement of the problem of the Middle East can be achieved only with the active participation of all the interested parties  particularly the people of Palestine under the leadership of the PLO. Any unilateral effort towards a settlement can only be partial and is therefore doomed to failure. The recent eruption of fighting in Lebanon is sufficient evidence of the inadequacy of the settlement plan being pursued so vigorously by certain Powers. That plan will fail because it does not take fully into account the interests of the Palestinian people and their legitimate demand for a homeland of their own. In this regard  Nigeria fully supports the conclusions of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine held recently at Geneva. We deeply regret the failure of certain Western Powers to attend that Conference.251.	My Government is also deeply concerned about the growing collaboration between Israel and South Africa  especially in the military and nuclear fields. This collaboration is inimical to the security of the whole of Africa and represents a threat to that security which Africa cannot ignore. As long as Israel persists in this policy it cannot hope for amity in its relations with Africa.252.	Recent developments in Central America are also a matter of concern to my Government. My Government strongly deplores direct intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua and other Central American States by a certain Power. Regardless of our views about the direction in which those States are moving  it is morally wrong and contrary to the provisions of the Charter for any external Power to force a change in their political and economic systems through the use or threat of force. We would urge this external Power to respect the inherent right Of Nicaragua and other Central American States to develop along their freely chosen path. We fully endorse and support the efforts of the Contadora Group to ease the tension in the region and to secure a negotiated settlement which will take full account of the right of all the people of the region to national self-determination  independence and sovereignty.253.	With regard to the situations in Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Korea  my Government is firmly convinced that only a reaffirmation and recognition of the right of the peoples of those countries to determine their own destinies  free from foreign interference  subversion  coercion or occupation and through the process of negotiations  will lead to a durable settlement. We therefore join in the call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from those countries so as to provide a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement. The presence of foreign troops can only continue to impede the process of securing a durable peace.254.	In addition to the profound anxieties raised by the prevailing global instability and tension  there is an equally widespread concern about the economic crisis which has confronted the world for some time now. Indifference to this crisis is a luxury which no country  no matter how strong economically  is able to afford in these circumstances  not only because of the scale of the crisis  but also because of its devastating impact on all groups of countries. It is indeed every country that suffers when world output and international trade contract in the manner already witnessed  particularly when the world economy drifts from bad to worse because of persisting maladjustments. To put it in a nutshell  international commodity markets are in a most sorry state  and the multilateral trading system is undergoing a serious erosion  while the international monetary and financial system is anything but orderly.255.	My Government is equally concerned about the ever-widening economic gap between the developed and developing countries. This is an important point  not just because it underscores the inherent structural imbalance in the global economy  but also because the burden of adjustment in the current crisis has fallen disproportionately on the developing countries. The grim economic picture in most of the developing countries is all too familiar: high foreign debts  continued erosion of terms of trade  an unacceptably high level of inflationâmost of it exported to themâsharp increases in the cost of capital and international credit  further restrictions on lending by the commercial banks and the continued decline in the flows of official development assistance. These formidable negative trends have led to a deep recession in the economies of the developing nations  resulting in a further decline in 1982 of the per capita gross domestic product of those countries. The development process has virtually come to a halt in most developing countries  as many of us have been forced by the deteriorating external environment in particular to curtail essential imports and national development programmes.256.	The critical economic situation in the African continent should indeed be underlined at this juncture because our countries are much worse off than those of any other region of the world. At a time of global improvement in food supply  acute shortages persist in Africa and have serious consequences in terms not only of increasing famine and hunger but also of the constraining influence on development of mounting food import bills. Owing to over-dependence on the export of one or two primary commodities  the continuing decline and uncertainty in commodity prices have taken their heaviest toll on African economies. The calamitous fall of export earnings has been compounded by a contraction of the external flow of resources. Obviously  one of the major prerequisites for economic recovery in Africa is to ensure a substantial flow of external finance to the region.257.	Although the universal impact of the current economic crisis obviously calls for concerted efforts by the entire international community  regrettably the multilateral spirit is on the wane. We have in the past few years continued to witness a growing reliance by the developed countries on a bilateral rather than a multilateral approach to settling the crisis confronting the world economy  particularly the economic problems of the developing countries. But we know full well that the results have been most disappointing. It is indeed widely acknowledged that the acute resource problem currently facing such leading development organizations as  for example  UNDP is attributable principally to the stagnation in the overall flow of official development assistance and the decline in the proportion committed through multilateral channels. Aside from this we see little advantage in undue recourse to bilateralism  which has indeed heightened the tendency to determine and allocate assistance on the basis of strategic East-West considerations that are completely irrelevant to the dire needs of the developing nations. The half-hearted approach which now seems to characterize international economic negotiation is probably the worst feature of the present crisis of multilateralism.258.	A word about the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade  is appropriate at this stage  since it was the most important negotiating conference held this year. We had hoped that the opportunity of the Belgrade meeting would be fully seized to deal decisively  effectively and in an integrated and global manner with the various problems of global trade and development  particularly the adverse situation facing the developing countries. Along with other members of the Group of 77  we went to Belgrade determined to be constructive and conciliatory  but we discovered to our utter dismay and disappointment that our partners in the North were in no mood for reciprocity. In the end what emerged from the Conference was a rehash of the results of previous sessions  with the addition of just a few half-measures  which did not amount to the serious package of urgent remedial and long-term measures that had been sought.259.	It is clear that we have all missed yet another golden opportunity to take appropriate measures to revitalize the world economy and  in particular  the accelerated and sustained development of developing countries. The international community has delayed taking the necessary vital steps  however  and this has worsened the plight of both the strong and the weak. We therefore wonder how long our partners in the North  particularly the developed market economies  will continue to drag their feet with regard to the restructuring of international economic relations. Greater progress could undoubtedly be made in this regard through a better appreciation by the developed countries of the reality of interdependence and the fact that the developing countries as a group have become a significant partner in the international economy.260.	The foregoing remarks are pertinent since they underscore the caution with which many have been inclined to receive reports about the economic upturn in certain developed countries. To us this is not a time for raising false expectations. Nor do we think that any trickle-down from the so-called recovery is the panacea for the grave economic problems facing the developing world. The deepening global crisis makes it ever more clear that We are dealing not with a mere cyclical phenomenon but with problems of structural maladjustments in various areas of international economic relations that require global and integrated solution.261.	Unless the structural imbalance that lies at the heart of the current global economic crisis is redressed urgently through a major and concerted international effort  it not only will remain a source of friction in relations among nations but will also undermine the steady growth of the world economy. Four years ago it appeared that there was a recognition of the necessity for an international effort when the Assembly adopted by consensus resolution 34/138  on global negotiations relating to international economic co-operation for development. Unfortunately  nothing positive has happened since to permit the launching of the global negotiations. Rather  consultations on the matter have simply petered out  and the situation now is one of total impasse and deadlock.262.	Responsibility for the failure to launch the global negotiations must rest with those countries which remain adamantly opposed to the idea. Now that this item is inscribed on the agenda of this session  all may not be lost yet. Together with other developing countries  we remain ready to engage in a constructive dialogue with the developed countries on this matter  in the belief that there is a mutuality of interests in seeking necessary reforms in the existing international economic order. We would therefore urge them to show the necessary political will in support of all efforts to facilitate progress towards the establishment of the new international economic order.263.	Stability and peaceful coexistence cannot be achieved in a world where the overwhelming majority of mankind lives in abject poverty and penury  nor can sustained global economic growth be attained without the active participation of the developing nations. Since  therefore  everyone stands to benefit from an enduring recovery of the world economy  and knowing the catastrophe to which inaction or feeble efforts can lead  the international community must take swift action in putting together a package of measures  short-term and long- term  which respond to the needs of developing nations in particular. Commodity markets must be significantly strengthened through accelerated implementation of the integrated programme for commodities  including the early coming into force of the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities  which my Government ratified recently. The rising tide of protectionism in the developed countries must be brought under control in the interest of world trade. There is also the imperative need to inject substantial and additional liquidity which responds to the needs of the world economy  particularly the accelerated growth of developing countries.264.	Before concluding my statement  I should like to declare the total support of my Government and the people of Nigeria for the peace movement  whose members are now clamouring throughout the world for an end to the arms race. The deployment of an ever-increasing number of nuclear warheads and the militarization of outer space make the spectre of a global holocaust a real possibility. This sword of Damocles has become an intolerable burden on mankind. The recent Korean jet incident shows how easily the world could be plunged into a nuclear holocaust through a sheer military blunder.265.	We must never allow a nuclear holocaust to happen. Collectively  we all have a responsibility to ensure that it does not  for the greatest tragedies have occurred not so much because of what was finally done as because of what had earlier foolishly been left undone. 	"
"99",5138,"NIC",38,1983,"74.	 First of all  please allow me to extend our congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Nicaragua is honoured that a brother Central American occupies this position of high responsibility at such a difficult time for our region and for the world. Your well- known dedication to the United Nations  your solid espousal of the ideals of nationalism  non-alignment and defence of the right of self-determination of peoples that Omar Torrijos Herrera left as a legacy for Panama  Latin America and the world  ensure for us a wise leadership in the work of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  in which you may always rely on the Nicaraguan delegation's co-operation.75.	We also wish to welcome Saint Christopher and Nevis into the United Nations. We are certain that it will contribute to the efforts of the Organization to secure peace.76.	This thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly has begun in a climate of world tension similar to others in this century which led to ever more destructive wars  involving irreparable human  material and cultural losses and representing a step backward in the history of human development.77.	Our concern knows no limits  for it is obvious that in a third world conflagration there will be no victors  only the vanquished  including those who seek military hegemony and who fan the flames of war. It is impossible to underestimate the consequences for world peace and security that stem from the proliferation of nuclear weapons since they were first dropped on the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.78.	The report by the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization reflects this critical international situation that appears to be growing worse.79.	The efforts of peoples in search of justice  freedom and peace clash with those defending monopolistic interests and denying the legitimate aspirations of the peoples. The results of this monopolistic policy are in violation of our peoples' human rights  for while $800 billion are squandered on weapons and efforts are made to increase their number and especially their degree of sophistication  46 000 children die each day of hunger  malnutrition and lack of medical attention.80.	Those who dream of breaking the strategic balance and impose an arms race are committing genocide. Those who ar6 using scientific knowledge which is the heritage of all humanity  outdoing the Nazis in the macabre task of spreading death  now even taking care not to destroy buildings or other physical objects  those whose latest nightmares foresee an arms race in the cosmos: they are committing genocide. Those who remain inflexible in the search for mutual security  stability and world peace are committing genocide. Those who invoke the name of God and human rights in order to justify a climate of cold war  larger budgets for nuclear weapons and more aggression against peoples around the world  they are committing genocide. They are participating in the murder of millions of children who die each year  victims of the economic injustice imposed on the world  but  above all  they are threatening humankind with extinction.81.	Today  when the threat of nuclear war takes on uncontrollable dimensions  it has become an urgent matter to reach realistic agreements in the Geneva framework. Let no more death-bearing missiles be stationed; let the nuclear arsenal be frozen in its development  production  accumulation and deployment; let the nuclear arsenal be reduced and eventually eliminated. Only when disarmament is universal  only when disarmament is complete  can there be international security. Let us station missiles of peace and bury once and for all the missiles of war.82.	In the wake of this policy of arms build-up  an escalation of aggression has been unleashed in different parts of the world  victimizing the peoples of the third world  some of whom have attained their liberation while others are still fighting for it.83.	The racist regime of Pretoria  with the approval and encouragement of the United States Government and other Governments which paradoxically claim to be concerned for human rights  attacks and invades Mozambique  Angola  Zambia  Zimbabwe  Seychelles  Lesotho  Botswana and Swaziland in an attempt to consolidate and perpetuate apartheid and racism. Nicaragua condemns the racist South African regime and voices its solidarity with the front-line States in their decision to support the total liberation of southern Africa.84.	By the same token  we support the struggle of the people of Namibia and their legitimate representative  the South West Africa People's Organization  and we demand the speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  as the Organization of African Unity demanded at its most recent summit meeting.85.	We also express our solidarity with the African National Congress  many of whose courageous members have fallen in its just struggle  among them the three South African anti-racist militants  amid the silence of Governments which maintain excellent relations with that regime.86.	Amidst democratic and humanistic postulates  assumed from monopolistic and demagogic positions  the peoples find themselves subjected to colonial and neo- colonial rule imposed by those so-called democracies. Such situation of the peoples of the Western Sahara and Puerto Rico  whose inalienable right to self-determination continues to be trampled; of the Palestinian people  whose right to form their own State continues to be denied; of the Korean people still artificially divided; of the Cypriot  Cuban  Argentine and Panamanian peoples  part of whose territories are either occupied by or under the control of foreign Governments; and of the Honduran people  whose sovereignty has been undermined and whose territory has been occupied by the American army.87.	Nicaragua repudiates the situations faced by those territories and therefore supports the struggle of the Saharan people and their representative. Nicaragua demands the decolonization of Puerto Rico and regards as unacceptable any measure aimed at changing this sister nation's political status without its consent and explicit participation. Nicaragua reaffirms its support for the Palestinian cause in the just struggle to recover the territory that has been taken away. We also support the holding of an international meeting on Palestine with the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization  the United States and the Soviet Union. Nicaragua supports the reunification of Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the area. Nicaragua reaffirms its support for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. Nicaragua demands the return to Cuba of the occupied territory of Guantanamo  the lifting of the blockade  a halt to the spy flights that violate Cuba's airspace and an end to violations of the territorial waters of this sister nation.88.	Still present on the Latin American scene is the military aggression that was carried out in the Malvinas Islands  which attempted to eternalize colonial domination over that territory  which is part of the Argentine nation. Nicaragua demands the implementation of the decision by the Committee on decolonization on the status of the Malvinas Islands  totally supporting the right to which the Argentine people is entitled.89.	Once more we reiterate our support for the legitimate and just demand by the Republic of Bolivia for the "" recovery of a direct and useful route to the Pacific Ocean  with full sovereignty over it. We appeal to all States to voice their solidarity with the Bolivian people in this inalienable right.90.	With respect to the tragic and dangerous conflict in Lebanon  the current crisis there is a direct result of the Zionist invasion and the expansionists and hegemonistic ambitions in the area. We appeal for respect of the cease-fire so that progress can be made toward reconciliation among all forces and sectors of that nation  in order to safeguard its sovereignty and end the increasingly direct intervention of the Powers currently involved there.91.	This policy of American military escalation can also be seen in major  ongoing provocation against the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Nicaragua denounces and repudiates these actions  while expressing its support to the Libyan people and Government. This aggressive policy is also manifested in South-East Asia  where plans are being hatched against the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea. Nicaragua confirms its solidarity with the heroic peoples of Viet Nam  Laos  and Kampuchea; condemns those destabilizing plans; and welcomes the efforts by the Secretary-General and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to promote unconditional dialogue among the countries of the region.92.	Meanwhile  in Afghanistan the United Nations has also made considerable efforts through its Secretary- General in the search for a political solution to the situation in that region. The Non-Aligned Movement has made similar efforts  issuing appeals that Nicaragua supports.93.	Among the most painful problems in the critical world situation is the war between Iran and Iraq  brother nations and members of the Non-Aligned Movement. We join in the calls for an end to this war so that through negotiations both sides can reach an honourable  just and lasting peace.94.	There should also be dialogue among the parties involved in  and a peaceful solution to  the conflict in Chad  safeguarding the right of the people of Chad to determine their own future freely. We extend our support to the efforts being made to attain a solution within the framework of anti-colonialist principles and within the OAU.95.	This aggressive and militaristic escalation in Africa  Asia  the Middle East and Latin America is also expressed in overt and covert actions promoted by the Government of the United States against the people and Government of Grenada. Nicaragua condemns this policy of destabilization and demands respect for the self-determination of the people and Government of Grenada.96.	This aggressive escalation also aims  through the Central Intelligence Agency  at overthrowing the revolutionary Government of Suriname by encouraging acts of destabilization against it. Nicaragua condemns the aggressive actions of the CIA and supports Suriname's right to determine its own future  free of all foreign interference and pressure.97.	At its Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983  the Non-Aligned Movement reaffirmed its support for the social and economic transformations that were begun in the Republic of Chile by President Salvador Allende. Nicaragua  paying homage to President Allende  supports the legitimate aspirations of the Chilean people to a re-establishment of their basic freedoms and human rights  and the policy of non- alignment that President Allende and the Government of Popular Unity defended until the very last moment.98.	After the long struggle led by General Omar Torrijos  the people of Panama achieved the signing of the Torrijos-Carter treaties. There have been attempts to violate and block the implementation of these agreements  and the United States Government also continues to use Panamanian territory  in the so-called Canal Zone  to train soldiers and mercenaries who are later employed against the people of El Salvador and the people of Nicaragua. Further abusing its presence on Panamanian territory  the United States uses the bases of the Southern Command for the trans-shipment of tons of weapons  the transport of American soldiers and for spy-flights of U-2  SR-71 and RC-135 aircraftâall with the intention of strengthening its policy of aggression against the Central American people.99.	Nicaragua demands the full application of the Torrijos-Carter treaties and demands that the Government of the United States stop using Panamanian territory in the so-called Canal Zone for launching aggressive actions against the peoples of Central America.100.	This international situation  which constitutes an ever greater threat to peace  is related directly to the inequality and exploitation suffered by our peoples at the hands of the developed countries with a market economy  which have imposed an unjust international economic order. This economic order has fed the prosperity of those countries and has expanded at the price of our underdevelopment. It is facing a crisis of its own making  the cost of which it is shifting to our nations. This economic order reactivates its economy through restrictive economic adjustments and industrial redeployment which has exacted a high social price from the inhabitants of those countries  with corresponding effects on the economies of our countries. In the last four years this economic order has meant a drop in per capita income of 19 per cent for the countries of the Central American region. This economic order meant a drop in export prices as large as 3.5 per cent in the year 1982 for the developing countries that do not produce oil  while in that same year the industrialized countries' trade relations grew by 1.5 per cent. This economic order has meant for the non-oil-producing countries of the third world a growing balance-of-payments deficit  which in 1982 reached $90 billion. This economic order aggravates our countries' foreign debt problem  now reaching $664 billion. This economic order has established the logic of the minorities; it expresses itself through the stabilization programmes which are imposed on third world countries as a precondition for the renegotiation of their debts. This economic order pursues a strategy that attempts to reduce the public debt  especially in terms of social services and subsidies for production and consumption  freezing salaries and increasing the cost of public services  thus re-introducing the former growth model. This economic order  which encourages  while imposing restrictive measures on our peoples  an economic policy that can only be termed antidemocratic  anti-human and irrational  disproportionately inflates its fiscal deficit in order to produce more and more weapons by investing billions of dollars in the laboratories of death. This economic order  which is irrational and contrary to our peoples' human rights  invests millions in subsidies to farmers so that they produce less in a world that is hungry and that requires more and improved agricultural production. This economic order has restricted our countries' access to financing. The international banks  which in 1980 granted up to $160 billion in new loans  have reduced new loans to only $95 billion in 1982.101.	But in the face of this unjust economic order  in the face of this logic of the minorities  the logic of the majority emerges with greater strength  and it demands a reduction in the development gap between the market- economy industrialized countries and the countries of the third world and a renegotiation of the terms of trade in order to establish a new international economic order which would include a strategy for food production aimed at achieving third world self-sufficiency  with the collaboration of the developed countries and the international agencies.102.	The economic needs of the impoverished countries must no longer be manipulated through economic and military blackmail. The international community must reject all forms of discrimination and economic aggression. We repeat that in the face of the strategy of the wealthy lenders  a strategy must be found by the impoverished debtors.103.	We have a duty to our peoples to establish an organization of debtor countries which would enable us to unite in a single forum. In that way we could move towards the formulation of a world economic policy in line with the logic of the majority. The problem of debt is not a unilateral problem  and that is why we must unite our efforts. This struggle must encompass the establishment of fair trade prices and credit at reasonable interest rates sufficient to promote a massive transfer of resources; the opening up of opportunities for development and for fulfilling our obligations with dignity; the attainment of a suitable level of dialogue between the wealthy and the impoverished; the establishment of a permanent means of consultation among debtor nations; and the establishment of a point of reference for the activation of mechanisms of reciprocal assistance and solidarity.104.	In that way we will be taking specific steps in favour of peace and stability without further sacrificing the well-being of our peoples. This requires above all an understanding of the whole for a more balanced process of integral development for mankind  and therefore a change in the attitude of the lender nations.105.	The Central American region is not exempt from this upsurge of military  political and economic tensions. Our peoples  historically deprived of the benefits of development  victims of injustice and a lack of freedom  are today assertively demanding these rights. The current struggle of the Central American peoples has its roots in the expansionist policies of the United States of America. In the year 1855 this expansionist policyâunder which extensive territory was grabbed from Mexicoâbrought about a military presence in Nicaragua in William Walker and his mercenaries  who were finally defeated and expelled after a bloody struggle. Since that time the various United States Administrations have endeavoured to stabilize brutal regimes in the region  which were to become their principal instruments of domination. From that time in the history of our peoples there were to be one landing of American soldiers after another and acts of direct intervention by the United States in our lands aimed at propping up tyrannical Governments and drowning the peoples' struggle in blood. That was how the Government of the United States became the best friend of tyrants such as Somoza  Ubico  Cartas and Hernandez. And that was how the United States Government became the greatest enemy of our peoples. In our region  American democracy has meant hunger and exploitation for the peasants and for the workers  and it has meant fabulous wealth for the exploiting minorities.106.	The triumph of the Nicaraguan revolution was but the result of this long struggle against American domination  a struggle which began in 1855 against Walker and which culminated on 19 July 1979 with the overthrow of Anastasio Somoza. Our revolution triumphed over this unjust United States policy  and while it is true that in the months immediately following that victory the possibility of new relations with the United States was opened  the entry into office of the new Administration in 1981 cut short this effort. Once more it was the policy of the ""big stick""  the policy of gunboats  the policy of terror.107.	We could say that from that moment on  from January 1981  the new United States Administration had declared war on the people of Nicaragua. The strategy was clear: military aggression  more economic aggression  more slander campaigns  more attempts to isolate us internationally  all with the goal of destabilizing the Nicaraguan revolution in order to bring about its destruction.108.	Thus they proposed to undermine the struggle of the peoples of the region  and in particular the struggle of the people of El Salvador. Crushing the Nicaraguan revolutionâaccording to the thinking of the United States Administration's strategistsâwould mean crushing the possibilities for change in Central America and would maintain unchanged the situation of injustice and lack of freedom. They decided  therefore  to carry out a military encirclement of the fighting people of El Salvador  aimed too against the liberated people of Nicaragua. From that time on the American military presence in the region has been on the increase  openly in El Salvador and Honduras and covertly in Costa Rica.109.	Immediately there followed actions by the guards of the Somoza regime. Armed  financed and directed by the United States Government through the CIA and the Pentagon  they began their criminal operations against our people from their bases of operations in Honduran territory.110.	Joining these aggressive actions from Costa Rican territory were foreign mercenaries  counter- revolutionaries of Nicaraguan origin and more Somoza guards. From its military base in the Southern Command inPanama  the United States began spy-flights over our territory with RC-135  SR-71 and U-2 aircraft. To date  there have been 203 spy-flights and 512 violations of our airspace by Honduran air force planes and by others provided by the CIA to the counter-revolutionaries who have penetrated our territory on supply  reconnaissance and attack missions from their operational bases in Honduras and Costa Rica.111.	In the same period between 1981 and 1983  we have detected on 34 occasions the presence in our territorial waters of United States naval vessels  totalling 56 violations of our territorial waters  24 from Honduran territory and 32 from Costa Rican territory. These activities are for the infiltration and supplying of counter-revolutionary groups. These activities by the United States Administration  for which $19 million was initially appropriated  were of a covert nature at the time. In the first months of 1982 the CIA had already designed a plan for military escalation  one that would be put into operation towards the end of that same year.112.	The response of our people was immediate. Between December of 1982 and January of this year these aggressions were defeated. In February the United States carried out joint military manoeuvres with the Honduran army to provide support to the counter-revolutionaries  who had embarked on a new wave of invasions  but they were again defeated.113.	In July and September the Government of the United States undertook new invasion attempts through the CIA  relying on the counter-revolutionaries and the Honduran army. At the same time it continued to conduct joint manoeuvres with the Honduran army in the area bordering on Nicaragua. In this month  September  it began an exercise called ""Ahuas Tara II""  designed to create a military situation involving the Honduran army in support of the army of El Salvador  on the one hand  and on the other  to threaten our revolution with a show of force in which a blockade and direct aggression are in no way ruled out. These military manoeuvres have been accompanied by naval manoeuvres unprecedented in the region  involving 19 warships with 16 484 troops on board and 5 000 more United States troops operating on Honduran soil.114.	These systematic military aggressions by the United States Government have become increasingly overt  and from 1979 to 1983 they have taken a toll of 717 Nicaraguans killed  including civilians and members of the armed forces. Forty-one of these were teachers and 154 were workers linked to production centres. Furthermore  529 peopleâworkers  students and techniciansâhave been kidnapped and 514 have been wounded. In defence of their sovereignty our armed people have annihilated 1 636 counter-revolutionaries and wounded 280. As another consequence of this United States policy we must add the losses our country has suffered from the destruction of ports  damages to production facilities and destruction of construction equipment  health centres  schools and day-care centres  which represent a total of 3 billion cordobas in damages  amounting to one quarter of our annual investments.115.	This month a new form of attack began to be employed in an attempt to ""normalize"" escalation against Nicaragua. Rocket-equipped planes coming from both Costa Rican and Honduran territory have dropped 500-pound bombs on the Augusto Cesar Sandino International Airport and on schools  houses and fuel tanks in the Port of Corinto. These bombings continue. Another part of this new American escalation is the blowing up of an oil-pumping station located two miles off our shores in the Pacific Ocean  and other criminal actions aimed at seriously affecting our economy.116.	As we have already pointed out  this aggressive activity is part of the increase in the United States military presence in the region  including the establishment of military and naval bases with new airports in Honduras  the organization and direction of the Salvadorian army in its military operations against the Salvadorian patriots and an increase in pressure on the governments of the region to involve them even further in the terrorist actions against Nicaragua.117.	The efforts carried out to contain the aggressive policy of the United States in the region and to promote dialogue and negotiation in pursuit of political solutions have also been significant. This Organization  through the Security Council and the Secretary-General  has watched the situation closely and has been active in these effort. The countries members of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries have also assumed a position that clearly condemns the aggressive destabilizing and interventionist policy in the region and have supported efforts to find a political solution. In this peace effort Mexico and France have made a valuable contribution in promoting dialogue. The activity undertaken in the Contadora Group by Mexico  Venezuela  Panama and Colombia has been solidly supported by all those genuinely interested in the search for peace. The position assumed by members of the United States Congress and important sectors of the press in the United States  by intellectuals  the religious community and the public at large  is consistent with the desire for peace on the part of the peoples of Central America who reject these aggressive policies.118.	We can say that there is agreement among very different ideological positions throughout the world in condemning the aggressive and bellicose escalation in the Central American region and in demanding that dialogue be the means for resolving these problems. The American Administration  however  tramples on all these efforts  rejecting them in practice  and is swiftly carrying forward its aggressive plans. The American Administration is trying to ignore the defeat its policy has suffered in the region. It has failed in its attempt to destroy the Salvadorian patriots and to send thousands of Somoza mercenaries against the Nicaraguan people. Our people are inflicting more casualties on them every day  and more of them are deserting.119.	Where are the successes of American policy in Central America? Where are its victories in El Salvador? Where are its champions of freedom in Nicaragua? The policy of military attacks and aggression by the United States in the region has already failed  and the only alternative left to the American Administration is greater and ever more direct involvement. This explains the presence of the United States warships  the presence of the United States soldiers  the visit by Mr. Weinberger  the statements by Mr. Ikle  the demands made by Mr. Shultz  Mr. Clark and Mr. Casey and the approval  in spite of a vote in Congress  of a further appropriation of $19 million to continue the covert operations against Nicaragua.120.	Nicaragua struggled against imperialist domination and the Somoza dictatorship in its search for peace  for justice and for freedom. Nicaragua cultivates and defends this vocation for peace  which is nothing more than the sacred right of our peoples to demand peace  to win peace and to defend it.121.	Yesterday we heard President Reagan state here  in the United Nations  that in Central America  as in southern Africa  the United States is trying to be persuasive regarding the need to avoid reliance on the use of force. We also heard him say that the United States was trying to construct a framework for peaceful negotiations  thereby pursuing a policy of keeping the major Powers out of the conflicts of the third world.122.	We must therefore expect a consistent policy in South Africa. We must therefore expect an immediate halt to the aggression in the Central American region. In other words  we must expect the immediate withdrawal of the United States warships from our territorial waters and from the region  the withdrawal of the United States soldiers from the region  the withdrawal of United States Government support for the armed activities of the Somoza guardsmen and the other counter-revolutionary mercenaries and an end to the covert operations.123.	Only concrete steps such as those would prove the existence of a genuine political will to support the peace initiative and of the process of dialogue and negotiations in order to ensure the security of all Central American States and strict implementation of Security Council resolution 530 (1983). Nicaragua believes that so long as those concrete steps are not taken there will be no way to find a solution to the region's crisis. We should like to reaffirm what we have already stated: first  an attempt must be made to win security for those States that feel threatened. Nicaragua is the most threatened and attacked country of our continent  threatened and attacked by an extra regional Power that openly defends such a policy. Therefore  as the military aggression increases  it is our right and sovereign obligation to provide our people with more and better weapons to defend the nation under attack.124.	We reiterate that the United States must withdraw its aggressive forces from the region and desist from its policy of aggression. Agreements must be reached offering security to all Stat is in the region. An end must be put to the participation of Honduras in the aggression against Nicaragua and the people of El Salvador. A solution must be found to the conflict in El Salvador  with the full participation of the Salvadorian patriots. Then we shall be in a position to discuss problems of weapons and advisers.125.	The United States Government has continued to put forward different pretexts for its aggressive policy in the region. It has called Nicaragua a threat because of the alleged arms traffic to El Salvador. On other occasions it has invoked the alleged East-West confrontation under way in the region. It has also voiced concern about the state of democracy in Nicaragua. Most recently  however  it has stated quite clearly that the problem is the very existence of a free Nicaragua.126.	All this indicates the lack of coherence and the instability of American policy  and the United States must be told that it is unable today  as it was unable yesterday  to see the root of the problem: the expansionist policy it first employed in the last century and which it continues to defend today.127.	Nicaragua has won its right to be free and that right must be respected. Nicaragua has defined itself and therefore acts as a non-aligned country  and this too must be respected. Nicaragua is building its democracy  and the sovereign right to choose its own internal system  its own brand of democracy  is a right of our people that cannot be negotiated  cannot be discussed and must be respected.128.	The avoidance of a conflagration in Central America is an obligation that concerns the entire international community  defenders of the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations. In the course of this year the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  meeting first in an extraordinary Ministerial Meeting of its Coordinating Bureau at Managua last January and then at New Delhi in March at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government  has expressed its resolute support for the efforts to find a peaceful solution to the problems of our region.129.	The Security Council  in its resolution 330 (1983)  also appealed urgently to all States to support the efforts of the Contadora Group to resolve differences by means of frank and constructive dialogue.130.	Despite the appeals and efforts  the situation in Central America is becoming more complicated. The acts of aggression against Nicaragua continue and are stepped up; there are threats  intimidation and intervention; there is an attempt to place the so-called vital interests of a great Power above the delicate efforts being made to achieve peace and coexistence in Central America on the basis of full respect for the sovereignty of all nations in the region.131.	Nicaragua has never attacked any country  but it will defend itself against any act of aggression  regardless of how great and powerful the aggressor may beâand we know that the United States  a military Power  is threatening Nicaragua. Whenever Nicaragua has been attacked and invaded it has defended itself  it has struggled  it has fought  and we Nicaraguans will always be ready to confront  resist and defeat new imperialist intervention.132.	In the face of this situation  the Assembly must give a new momentum and support to peace-making efforts through a new  urgent appeal to all States to refrain from committing acts that worsen the situation in the region. To this end  Nicaragua is asking that the question of Central Americaâthreats to peace  sovereignty  the exercise by the Central American peoples of the right to self-determination and peace initiativesâbe considered as an urgent item on the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly.133.	This session of the General Assembly brings us together at a time of great suffering for our peoples and of unprecedented threats to the future of mankind.134.	There is still time to avoid a catastrophe. We must speak with one voice and be resolved  but above all  we must take action to denounce and expose the irrational positions that have been taken and to strengthen the rational ones. This is no time for us to ignore the situation; this is no time for timid  vacillating positions. There is a risk of confronting more difficult situations  but what is at stake goes beyond specific interests. It is the obligation of all  particularly those of us that have no nuclear weapons nor economic power  to demand peace and fight for peace with all the moral force of our peoples. "
"100",5184,"NLD",38,1983,"ï»¿40.	I should like first of all to congratulate Mr. Illueca upon his election to the presidency of the Assembly's thirty-eighth session  and I am fully confident that he will guide our deliberations with benevolence and wisdom.41.	With the chair's permission  I wish to extend  on behalf of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  warm words of welcome to the new Member  Saint Christopher and Nevis.42.	We are convening at a time when the need for an organization like this  the United Nations  with the essential concrete and practical purposes set out in its Charter  is greater than ever  because the international situation is deeply disturbing in many respects.43.	Relations between a number of States have deteriorated since we met here last year. Several countries continue to suffer the oppressive effects of foreign invasion  and the end of their suffering is nowhere in sight. The savage war between Iran and Iraq has entered its fourth year. Millions of people continue to live in extreme poverty. Less than a month ago  we were stunned by the cruel destruction of a civilian airliner by the Soviet Union  which has since been rightly condemned in various forums within the United Nations system.44.	In a world which is subject to such stress and where violence so often takes the place of justice and the rule of law  we need this unique and universal Organization  the United Nations. We have to do all we can to make it into an effective and efficient instrument.45.	According to the Charter  one of the purposes of the United Nations is to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of its Members in the attainment of their common ends. In many instances the Organization has been highly successful. The era of colonization has virtually been brought to an end  as witnessed by the representation in this Hall of 158 independent States  a threefold increase in its original membership. The work of the specialized agencies should be mentioned too. Public attention is seldom commensurate with their unmistakable achievements. Equally important progress has been reached in the codification of human rights and the creation of instruments for their implementation.46.	Yet there is a general feeling that the United Nations has more often failed in being the centre for harmonizing our actions  a feeling so acutely expressed by the Secretary- General in his reports on the work of the Organization. Up to a point we should allow ourselves a sense of realism and recognize that tension will always exist between the lofty principles and purposes of the Charter and the harsh realities of our time. In bridging this gap the Organization may perhaps never be completely successful. But even a modest view of what we can ultimately achieve does not absolve us from keeping constantly in mind the Organization's guiding principles.47.	Whenever the United Nations appears unable to steer the course of events  we ourselves should take the blame. The United Nations is only a stage on which we  the Members  are the actors. If the United Nations fails to implement its decisions  it is again to ourselves that we should look for an answer. We  the Members  should harmonize our positions and our actions  making the most of the United Nations as a centre for our endeavours.48.	Last year's report of the Secretary-General' has been the subject of wide-ranging consultations among the members of the Security Council. Representing a country which took part in the consultations  I regret to say that their outcome cannot as yet be considered very satisfactory. Nevertheless  I do hope that the Council's report can at least serve as a starting-point for more in-depth consultations and practical conclusions. The credibility and effectiveness of the Organization require us to give a constructive response to the urgent appeal of the Secretary-General  and after eight months of experience as a member of the Security Council  I cannot but voice some disappointment over the way the Council functions or sometimes appears unable to function. To quote but one example  I refer to the case of Chad. That country  faced with armed intervention  had recourse to the Security Council without gaining any satisfaction on its fully justified complaint. In other cases the Council succeeded in adopting resolutions  but one wonders whether these were all up to the measure of the duties and responsibilities of the Council. The reasons for this were perhaps manifold  but I should like to point to one which  to my mind  is also relevant to the work of the General Assembly and to international conferences under the aegis of the United Nations.49.	Here I have in mind the misuse of the procedure of consensus. In his recent report the Secretary-General calls for a concerted approach to problems of peace and security and a constructive search for consensus on difficult and controversial issues. To my mind consensus is the perfect expression of the Charter's image of the United Nations as the centre for harmonizing our actions. It is true also that the broadest possible support is necessary for United Nations recommendations and decisions to be effective. A strong argument in favour of the consensus procedure relates to the democratic necessity of taking legitimate minority views into consideration instead of simply overruling them. For all these reasons my country favours the consensus procedure  consensus being understood in its true meaning of a view or feeling basically shared by all. Only in the case of such a real consensus will it be possible to move from words to action.50.	Sometimes  however  the effectiveness of the consensus approach is considerably reduced. This happens when consensus is used for covering up instead of reconciling differing views. Then the final result is only very meagre  a lowest common denominator with the appearance but without the strength of real consensus. Of course  no result at all is likely to come of efforts to arrive at a consensus where there is basic disagreement  let alone open conflict; for instance  a complaint of a victim of aggression against its aggressor. The work of the Security Council gives examples of both situations.51.	A more common malpractice  not unknown to the Assembly either  occurs when pressure groups produce draft resolutions on a ""take it or leave it"" basis  intended to extract formal support from an unwilling minority. Decisions taken on this basis in my view can only be a flimsy victory for their sponsors  because such superficial unanimity lacks the force of a commonly shared political will and the decisions reached tend to remain a dead letter.52.	To give an example of what I have in mind I refer to the Paris conference on Namibia. This conference adopted a declaration and a programme of action by official consensus. The contents of these documents were highly predictable  not only because their drafts ran along lines to be expected  but above all because no real negotiations on these texts were allowed. When subsequently a number of countries abstained from full participation in the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983  this certainly was due  at least in part  to the precedent set by the Namibia conference. To sum up: if we really want the United Nations to be a centre for harmonizing not only our words but also  and foremost  our deeds and actions  then I think we should apply the consensus procedure as judiciously as we possibly can.53.	Next to being scrupulous about the way in which we arrive at decisions  we should be wise to support the Secretary-General in his efforts to improve the efficiency of the Organization itself. The times when real growth in programme budgets could realistically be envisaged are over  I am afraid. Both we and the Secretariat will have to set priorities and adhere to them  because both we and they have to do more with the same amount of money  of even less.54.	I welcome the establishment by the Secretary- General of a high level advisory group on administrative reform with the task of identifying issues and areas in which modification or reform could be effected. I hope this group will not hesitate to come forward with constructive proposals.55.	The problems of the Middle East will again be among the Assembly's most urgent and most intractable. The use of force  originating both from within and without  is the daily predicament of the people of Lebanon. We welcome the cease-fire  and I congratulate those who brought it about. We sincerely hope it will allow the parties in the conflict to engage in a dialogue soon. The Government of Lebanon deserves support in its efforts to realize a comprehensive national reconciliation and to uphold the country's unity and independence. This requires the complete and prompt withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory  except for those whose presence may be requested by the legitimate Government. United Nations observers might play a useful role in supervising the cease-fire.56.	The Organization has been especially involved in the Lebanese situation by the deployment of a United Nations peace-keeping force in the southern part of the country. It is a sorry state of affairs that for more than a year now UNIFIL has been held hostage to a situation beyond its control. This frustrating experience cannot  in our view  go on indefinitely  and the Netherlands Government has consequently decided to terminate its participation in UNIFIL in its present form. In due course  the Security Council  acting in agreement with the Government of Lebanon  may devise a more meaningful role for UNIFIL than the Force is able to fulfil nowadays. In view of this possibility  ways and means are being considered for the Netherlands withdrawal not be complete  so that our presence can be easily expanded again at a later date  because the Netherlands interest in United Nations peacekeeping remains undiminished.57.	The Palestinian problem is very much at the centre of the problems in the Middle East. Together with our European partners we have stated many times that the Palestinian people must be enabled to exercise its legitimate rights  including the right to self-determination  with all that this implies. It is certain that there will be no peace in the Middle East without the Palestinians' finding their rightful place among the other peoples of the region. Nor will there be peace as long as the Palestinian people do not recognize the right of Israel and its people to exist within secure and recognized borders.58.	Peace in the Middle East will not prevail unless the security and legitimate interests of all States and peoples of the region are taken into account. Their rights must be mutually recognized by the parties themselves. The threat or use of force must be renounced by all.59.	The Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are in our view an extremely worrying factor. As a first step Israel should refrain from expanding these settlements  which my Government considers to be illegal  and they should refrain from creating new ones. This settlement policy in our judgment is not a matter of the right of individual people to live where they want  but of prejudging the question of how and where the Israeli and the Palestinian people will live next to each other in the future. For this reason we view this settlements policy as a major and growing obstacle to peace.60.	Afghanistan and Kampuchea share the fate of being victims of foreign invasion and occupation. Both peoples are denied the full exercise of their right to self-determination and self-government. Neighbouring countries have to provide shelter to huge numbers of refugees. The Soviet Union and Viet Nam  who pride themselves on being progressive and peace-loving  hold in their grip two Members of the Organization by force. The Assembly should once again press for a political solution which would enable Afghanistan and Kampuchea to regain their full independence. We owe it to the suffering people of both countries to show that our support for their rights remains as strong as ever. With reference to the situation in Kampuchea  I should like to commend the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations for their endeavours to promote a political solution.61.	Korea remains an area of persistent tensions. We are convinced of the need for a speedy resumption of the dialogue between North and South in order to settle the Korean question by peaceful means. The Republic of Korea should be allowed to become a full Member of the United Nations  and so should North Korea  if and when it so desires.62.	For many reasons the situation in Central America is a matter of serious concern. The States in this region are going through a painful period of internal strife and instability  caused by social inequality and economic underdevelopment and aggravated by foreign interference. They face the possibility of wider armed conflict. Discussing this situation in the Security Council  the Netherlands representative stated that the problems of the region require a negotiated solution based on the principles of non-interference  non-aggression  sovereign equality and self-determination. The nations of Central America should be free to choose their own form of government  and there is no justification to impose revolutions on these peoples. Neither is there any justification to support efforts to destabilize existing governments through overt or covert operations in co-operation with internal resistance movements. We heartily welcome and support the efforts of the Contadora Group to find solutions to the problems besetting their region. The Group's Cancun Declaration on Peace in Central America  issued on 17 July 1983	contains many constructive proposals  .of which I would like to mention the call for an end to the arms build-up in the region and for evolution and progress in the field of economic development and social justice  closely linked to the creation or strengthening of democratic political institutions.63.	Our relations with Latin America and the Caribbean region remain particularly important to us. The Kingdom of the Netherlands follows with great interest the efforts towards closer economic and political co-operation in that part of the world. While the Netherlands welcomes trends toward democracy  we deplore the continuing serious disrespect for human and civil rights  which remains  sorry to say  a widespread phenomenon in the area. I have to make special mention of our relations with Suriname  which have been put under so heavy a strain by the appalling events of December 1982 in Paramaribo. We sincerely hope that the people of Suriname will soon be allowed to revert to democratic values and that respect for human rights will be restored.64.	The situation in Namibia seems to remain inextricable  even though the mission of the Secretary-General  in pursuance of Security Council resolution 532 (1983)  was as successful as could have been under the circumstances. Virtually all outstanding issues with regard to the United Nations plan for Namibia were resolved. However  it is still impossible to launch the plan because South Africa sticks to its position regarding the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola as a precondition for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).65.	In my view this state of affairs is very discouraging and unfair to the Namibian people  whose independence is further delayed by extraneous factors. A peaceful solution to the Namibian problem is also  as the Secretary- General observed  the key to a peaceful future for all countries of the region. I would urgently call on all concerned to redouble their efforts and to remove as quickly as possible the last obstacles to the implementation of the settlement plan.66.	As a first and urgent step to get things moving the Assembly  in my modest opinion  should call on South Africa to stop its military incursions into Angola and to agree to a cease-fire. This seems a first prerequisite  as the Secretary-General rightly advocated  ""to reduce the tensions and contentious issues and to put an end to conflict in the area as a whole""  After so many years of frustration an initiative of this kind may not seem good enough  but it could serve to put matters on the right track.67.	As far as sanctions against South Africa are concerned  the world community simply cannot indulge South Africa's forever defying the principles of interstate and human behaviors. apartheid is one of the most abhorrent examples of racial discrimination and of institutionalized denial of human rights. For that reason the Netherlands has associated itself with numerous Assembly resolutions calling for sanctions against South Africa  provided that these sanctions are selective and compulsory  both being basic requirements for any effective impact on South Africa's policies. For some years my country's delegation has sponsored the Assembly's resolutions on investments in South Africa. Moreover  we have supported the call for an oil embargo  also on the basis of a mandatory decision by the Security Council.68.	I believe the best thing would now be for us to concentrate our immediate efforts on one measure  aimed at strengthening the existing United Nations arms embargo against South Africa. We feel it is of the utmost importance to deny this country the means to pursue its policies by force. Its constant pattern of armed intervention in neighbouring countries and repression of internal opposition forces obliges us to deprive it of any assistance in the field of the manufacture or acquisition of arms. The Security Council  in its resolution 418 (1977)  has already prohibited the sale or transfer of arms to South Africa. In view of South Africa's efforts to build up its own capacity in arms manufacturing  we should agree to expand the existing embargo by a ban on arms imports from South Africa  since such purchases enhance the economic viability of the South African arms industry and strengthen that country's autarky in the armaments field.69.	This year the Assembly will celebrate the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Universal Declaration was the foundation for the International Bill of Human Rights. This comprehensive body of human lights norms must be considered one of the greatest achievements of the United Nations and  together with the Charter  as the basis for United Nations involvement with human rights. My Government was encouraged by the Assembly's adoption last year of resolution 37/200  affirming that ""a primary aim of international co-operation in the field of human rights is a life of freedom and dignity for each human being  that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interrelated and that the promotion of one category of rights should never exempt or excuse States from the promotion and protection of the others"". By adopting this resolution the Assembly has committed itself to an even-handed and strong policy in the Field of human rights.70.	They are being violated in ail parts of the world. The resolution I referred to urges all States to co-operate with the Commission on Human Rights in its study of the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world. It is therefore distressing to see the continuing unwillingness of some Member States to extend their co-operation to the special rapporteurs appointed by the Commission to study the human rights situation in those States.71.	Although the lifting of martial law offered some hope for a more forthcoming policy  the Government of Poland  which in the past has supported calls for cooperation by other Governments  has shown no sign so far of heeding the legitimate concern of the international community over the continued violation of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Polish people.72.	It is equally to be hoped that the Government of Chile will co-operate with the Commission's new special rapporteur. Speaking of Chile  I want to add that the democratic forces in that country have my Government's full support and that I feel they deserve the support of other countries as well. It is heartening to realize that no amount of official repression has been able to eradicate the movement for the restoration of democracy. But Chile is not the only country where such a movement has proved to be stronger than the regime it has to resist.73.	The full horror of the scale on which the fundamental right to life itself is violated became painfully clear in the report on summary or arbitrary executions  including extra-legal executions  submitted to the Commission by Mr. Amos Wako. Conservative estimates cited by Mr. Wako put the number of known victims of such executions at no less than 2 million in the last 15 years: men and women  young and old  who were perceived in one way or another to be in opposition to their Government. Since then reports of summary or arbitrary executions and of disappearances  torture and other violations of the sanctity of the human person continue to be received. We are reminded daily of the human suffering taking place in various parts of Central America  where the names of some countries have acquired an unfortunate connotation of pain and fear.74.	From Iran  top  we hear of the maltreatment and execution of members of the Baha'i faith  in defiance of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.75.	In many parts of the world the full enjoyment of human rights is undercut by the state of development and by sheer poverty. These problems will figure high in the economic section of the agenda of this-session. The President of the European Economic Community has dealt extensively  also on our behalf  with the issues involved in international economic co-operation and North-South relations.76.	The economic issues before this session will once again centre on the ability of the international community to make a common assessment of the present state of the world economy and to make the necessary recommendations for concrete and immediate action. The disappointing results of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which took place at a crucial moment  given the situation of the world economy  have shown that the international community is deeply divided over the question of how to solve the present economic crisis and in particular on the role that Governments should play in overcoming this crisis. At the same time that session showed broad agreement on the analysis of the present situation. There seemed to be agreement on the interdependence of our world  on the internal diversity within both the North and the South and on the necessity to find common solutions to these various problems.77.	The global economic dialogue is taking place at various levels and in different forums. In recent reports on North-South relations  the Brandt Commission and the Commonwealth experts have made interesting suggestions on ways to improve the handling of the dialogue. I think we owe it to them and to ourselves to revitalize the negotiating mechanisms in order to arrive at practical solutions to outstanding problems.78.	Looking at the general situation of the world economy we discern some hopeful signs of economic recovery. However  there is no assurance of an early overall recovery. It is evident that there is a need for action both at the national and at the international level to promote sustained economic recovery. A concerted approach is required among nations whose economies are interdependent  so as to avoid our making short-term gains at each other's expense. There continues to be a great need for international support for and co-operation with those weaker countries whose economies are vulnerable and which for their development cannot do without considerable assistance. In particular we feel it is imperative that developed countries take the required measures to support the poorest  in order that they too may benefit from the economic recovery.79.	The Netherlands Government  for its part  is committed to maintaining the present level of its official development assistance  which amounts to well over 1 per cent of its gross national product. Allow me to appeal to all rich nations equally not to falter in their efforts concerning development co-operation.80.	Over the years we have consistently called for the balanced financial participation of all donor countries in the voluntary funds of the United Nations. We firmly believe that the development system of the United Nations can function satisfactorily only if the financial burden is more evenly spread over the donor countries. The situation whereby only a few countries  among them my own  carry a disproportionate burden cannot continue. In 1984 another important international element will be added to the decision-making on multilateral development co-operation  that is  the International Conference on Population to be held next August at Mexico City. We hope that that Conference will deepen our knowledge of the relationships between population and economic and social development and lead to new operational activities to solve the pressing problems of population growth  poverty and environmental degradation.81.	All our efforts to solve political problems or to improve the international economic order will be in vain if we do not succeed in our primary task of maintaining international peace and security. Wherever war and armed conflict occur  the need to fight for survival tends to become the single overriding issue. Moreover  it is a tragic truth that because of the destructive power of modem weaponry the means of war threaten to destroy the very values they are meant to defend. This applies particularly to nuclear war  which would spell disaster for all  but we have only to look at countries like Lebanon or Afghanistan  for instance  to realize what destruction so-called conventional weapons can produce.82.	In view of this we must feel bound to agree on curtailing the armaments race and to adopt incisive measures in the field of arms control and disarmament. At stake is the basic question whether man is to be master or slave of the forces of his own creation. It is therefore painful to note that although United Nations efforts in the Held of disarmament have increased in recent years  they seem to have yielded diminishing results. The report of the Committee on Disarmament  which forms the basis of our discussions at this session  speaks of strenuous efforts but not of concrete agreement.83.	The same may still be said of the crucially important negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the question of reducing their nuclear forces to lower and safer levels and achieving a more stable balance. The present state of East-West relations  which a number of events have put under a heavy strain  should not lead to a lessening of efforts to bring these negotiations to substantial results. On the contrary  in a period of increasing tensions the rationale for seeking nuclear arms reductions should be even more apparent. Especially in the Held of intermediate-range nuclear forces  the coming months will be of critical importance. In this respect  I welcome and endorse the proposals made public by President Reagan in his speech at the 5th meeting of this session.84.	The Government and people of the Netherlands are anxiously waiting for a break-through in the negotiations at Geneva which would eliminate the threat of existing intermediate-range systems and thereby make it possible to forgo deployment on the Western side. Should this goal prove unattainable in one step  we should follow the road of redressing the existing imbalance at the lowest possible level.85.	The quantitative as well as the qualitative growth of the arms build-up makes it an increasingly complex matter. Arms control negotiations aimed at reductions are no longer sufficient by themselves. It is generally accepted nowadays that they must be accompanied by confidence-building measures. These measures can create more openness about military activities and thereby create a climate more conducive to arms control in general. It is for this reason that I warmly welcome the convening of the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  to be held at Stockholm.86.	Nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war  with all that this implies  is one of the most challenging issues confronting us all. Here at the United Nations we should not relax our efforts to achieve eventually a comprehensive prohibition of nuclear testing as an effective collateral measure. Such a prohibition would constitute an important step forward on the road to nuclear disarmament by diminishing the dangers of both horizontal and vertical proliferation. The Netherlands continues to attach great importance to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of nuclear Weapons. We therefore co-sponsored the request to include on the agenda of this session of the Assembly the question of an early and adequate preparation for the third review conference of the parties to the Treaty. A failure such as that of the last review conference should at all costs be prevented. An agreement between the nuclear Powers on nuclear security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States would constitute a positive contribution to these efforts.87.	The application of space technology evokes admiration of man's ingenuity but also fear of his perennial temptation to turn his capacities to evil ends. It appears that we still have the opportunity to prevent an arms race in outer space which  if it took place  would add a new dimension to the existing world-wide arms build-up. Before we are overtaken by rapid technological developments  especially in the field of anti-satellite weapons  we must agree to forego such a dangerous course. The Netherlands delegation will be active in promoting a solution along these lines.88.	The issue of chemical weapons was one of the main and most extensively debated items on the agenda of the Committee on Disarmament. One would have hoped that this year  after so many years  this issue would have matured sufficiently to allow for practical and fruitful negotiations. Substantial progress has been made  and at least from a technical point of view the analysis of the problems involved seems to have been exhausted. We should exhort the Committee to engage in a final drive to conclude an agreement which would free the world from the spectre of chemical warfare.89.	I have reached the end of my statement. Little of what I have said in my commentary on world events was particularly cheerful  but it would be wrong for me to finish on a gloomy note. We are here at the United Nations  at the centre of an organization which could perform miracles if given the opportunity. It was designed to perform something like a miracle: to save us from war  to realize human rights  to help establish justice and social progress.90.	The opportunity is there for us to take. It is completely up to us to make full use of the Organization  which we have set up or joined of our own free will. The Netherlands has not yet lost hope that this will come about. "
"101",5229,"NOR",38,1983,"ï»¿  I should first like to associate myself with all previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the great office of President of this session of the General Assembly. I wish you every success in the fulfilment of your important tasks. One of the most famous works of the great Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen is Peer Gynt. Through the character of Peer Gynt  Ibsen gave life to an inclination which we find in all of usâthe inclination to evade the problems that we face. States Members of the United Nations seem to suffer from the same weakness as Peer Gynt. It is now nearly four decades since the United Nations was established  but we have still not been able to make it an effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. This situation will continue as long as we do not take our commitments to the United Nations more seriously and take the necessary steps to make it a better and more efficient organization. In his report on the work of the Organization to the General Assembly last year the Secretary-General appealed to the Member States to take urgent action to enable the United Nations to fulfill the responsibilities outlined in its Charter. Subsequent international events have clearly demonstrated the need for the measures he called for. The most alarming feature is the continued tendency to resort to the use of force to settle international disputes. In order to support the Secretary-General's efforts to strengthen the United Nations  Norway  together with other Nordic countries  has presented a report with some ideas to this effect. Let me briefly mention some of the recommendations contained in the report. First  the efficiency of the Security Council should be improved. Procedures should be developed for initiating action by the Council at an early stage of conflicts. The idea of holding periodic meetings of the Council at the ministerial level to review the international situation should be considered again. Such periodic meetings could be useful both for early-warning purposes and for review of decisions taken previously by the Council. Decisions of United Nations organs should be the beginning and not the end of governmental concern and action  as rightly stated by the Secretary-General. All Member States have assumed an obligation under the Charter of the United Nations to respect and to implement the decisions of the Security Council. The members of the Security Council  and particularly its permanent members  ought here to feel a special responsibility. Secondly  the Nordic report expresses support for a strengthening of the role of the Secretary-General. It is especially important that he should be able to act in the first stage of a conflict  and the report therefore strongly supports his idea of developing a wider and more systematic capacity for fact-finding in potential conflict areas. Further  it encourages him to make more use of his powers under Article 99 of the Charter to bring matters to the attention of the Security Council. Thirdly  the ability and capacity of the United Nations to launch peace-keeping operations should be strengthened. Past experiences have shown us that all peace-keeping operations must have a clearly defined and operationally feasible mandate. It should be a precondition that all parties to a conflict are ready and willing to co-operate with the peace-keeping force in discharging its mandate. The collective responsibility of all United Nations members for the financing of peace-keeping operations must be respected. Let me add that the Nordic countries have for many years had stand-by forces earmarked for United Nations peace-keeping operations. We are prepared to share our training programmers for the forces with other countries. The East-West relationship plays a dominant role in international affairs. Its impact is felt worldwide  but is of particular significance to the European countries  because it has a direct bearing upon their security situation. East-West relations in the early 1970s were characterized by the efforts to promote defense. This was above all marked by the signing of the Helsinki Final Act in 1975.  We had hoped that this event would lead to moderation and restraint by all partiesâalso in the military Held. However  a dominant feature of the European security situation in the last part of the 1970s was an increasing military buildup by the Soviet Union. West European countries observed with growing concern the development of a new generation of medium-range land- based Soviet SS-20 nuclear missiles  targeted on Western Europe  adding drastically to the existing Soviet military superiority in Europe. This development took place at a time when the Soviet Union had achieved parity with the United States in strategic nuclear arms. Against this background the countries of NATO found it necessary to counter the increased Soviet medium-range nuclear capacity and adopted in 1979 the double-track decision. It was decided to deploy in Europe 572 new United States missiles of a similar kind from the end of 1983 onwards  while at the same time offering negotiations in order to reduce or preferably eliminate the need for such weapons. These negotiations have now been going on at Geneva for more than two years. In this period the Soviet Union has continued to deploy its missiles. The number now stands at approximately 350 missiles with more than 1000 warheads. In his statement earlier today  President Reagan outlined the main elements of the new United States proposals in Geneva. These proposals demonstrate the firm will and determination of the NATO countries to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion as soon as possible. They have  as President Reagan also mentioned  been subject to extensive consultations in the NATO alliance and have Norway's full support. We hope that the Soviet Union will respond to this initiative in a constructive manner. Our objective is not only to stop the nuclear arms race  but to achieve substantial reductions in these weapons. A general freeze on nuclear weapons is not an adequate solution  as by definition it would mean freezing the present imbalance  and this would probably weaken our possibilities of achieving real disarmament. In the United Nations context there has obviously been a tendency to focus our disarmament discussion mainly on nuclear weapons and to ignore the role played by conventional arms. As pointed out by the Secretary- General in his latest report on the work of the Organization  it is necessary to keep in mind that the many millions killed in war since Hiroshima and Nagasaki have all died from conventional weapons. We also know that the greater part of the vast resources spent on armaments all over the worldâfrequently to the detriment of essential needsâhas been used for conventional arms. In Europe  the question of conventional arms has been subject to negotiations in the mutual and balanced force reduction talks at Vienna. A successful outcome of these talks would significantly promote confidence and stability between East and West. Furthermore  conventional arms reductions to equal and lower force levels would raise the nuclear threshold. The Madrid meeting on security and co-operation in Europe also aimed at achieving more openness and confidence among the States of Europe. It is encouraging that these talks have now concluded positively. This provides a basis for further progress. The negotiations within the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva and disarmament deliberations in the General Assembly provide an important and necessary supplement to the direct East-West negotiations. The General Assembly will set in motion the preparations for the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which is to be held in 1985. The upholding and the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime must remain on our international agenda as a task of high priority. Emphasis also must be put on the achievement of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Norway believes that such a treaty would represent an important disarmament measure. Likewise we attach considerable importance to the efforts to reduce and ultimately prohibit other weapons of mass destruction. It is particularly important to expand the present prohibition on the use of chemical weapons to include production and stockpiling  as well as a permanent and credible machinery for verification. We note with satisfaction that the question of prevention of an arms race in outer space has been placed on the agenda of international disarmament negotiations. We shall welcome all realistic proposals put forward with this objective in mind. They must be based on mutually agreed  balanced and verifiable formulas and include proposals prohibiting anti-satellite weapons. The tragic incident of the South Korean passenger aircraft which was shot down near the island of Sakhalin by Soviet military aircraft has shocked the world community. The use of armed force against international civil aircraft is incompatible with elementary considerations of humanity and with the rules  standards and recommended practices of the 1944 Chicago Convention All efforts must now be made  through ICAO  to prevent such a tragic incident from ever happening again. Norway fully endorses the resolution adopted at the special session of the Council of ICAO on 16 September calling for full investigation of the incident and measures to improve procedures relating to the interception of civil aircraft. The Soviet Union has a particular responsibility to co-operate fully with the competent international aviation authorities in this matter. We find a number of international conflicts on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. The Norwegian delegation will refer to them all at the appropriate time. At this juncture  I shall address only one particular question  namely the situation in Lebanon. For a long time now we have been receiving daily reports on extensive fighting  civilian tragedies and failed efforts to restore peace. The situation has been such that it could easily reach proportions which might have consequences for peace and stability beyond the borders of Lebanon. We therefore warmly welcome the cease-fire which was announced last night. We urge all parties fully to respect the provisions of this cease-fire agreement. However  a lasting peaceful solution to the conflict in Lebanon can be achieved only if some basic principles are observed by all parties concerned. The independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon must be respected. The request of the Lebanese Government for withdrawal of foreign forces must be met. Violations of human rights continue to take place to an alarming extent in many parts of the world. We are regularly confronted with reports of summary and arbitrary executions  racial discrimination  torture  involuntary disappearances and denial of basic political and civil rights. In many parts of the world such violations seem to be the rule rather than the exception. This is a situation which the international community must not tolerate. The realization of the dignity and equality of all human beings is an indispensable precondition if we are to strengthen and obtain international peace and security. The question of whether or not a State can be trusted is to a great extent influenced by its record in the Held of human rights. Clearly  the major responsibility for promoting and protecting human rights rests with Governments themselves within their area of jurisdiction. On the other hand  we share an international responsibility to oppose and prevent violations wherever they occur. The international community cannot accept the principle of non-interference in internal affairs as a justification not to act. The application of basic human rights standards must be truly universal and not subject to political expedience. Against this background  it is important to strengthen the institutional machinery of the United Nations in order to increase its ability to deal promptly with serious cases of human rights violations. The establishment of a post of high commissioner for human rights is such an instrument. We hope the recent decision by the Sub-Commission of the Commission on Human Rights 9 has brought the establishment of such a post closer to realization. Finally  let me say a few words about the North- South issues which constitute an important part of our agenda. In spite of all efforts to bring the dialogue forward  we regretfully have to note that little progress has been achieved during recent years. Signs of economic recovery have been noted in some industrialized countries  but there is still widespread uncertainty about its underlying strength and durability. Even if we were to obtain increased and sustained growth in the developed market-economy countries  this alone would not be sufficient to bring about the reactivation of the development process in most developing countries. Recovery by itself cannot solve the problems of capital shortage  international indebtedness and protectionism.  The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade  took place in a constructive atmosphere  but it did not achieve the results we had hoped for. The Conference did  however  provide for common ground for tackling some of the most acute problems. It is now our hope that the joint meeting of IMF and the World Bank  which is currently taking place in Washington  will be able to bring the most pressing problems the developing countries are facing a step forward. We hope this meeting will give impetus to a positive result from the ongoing negotiations on the seventh replenishment in the International Development Association. Norway for its part is ready to participate in a seventh replenishment of the Association  which  in our view  ought to be at least as great in real terms as the sixth. Within the United Nations there is a need to ensure more concerted action by the organizations of the system in dealing with the important issues of development and international economic co-operation. For UNDP the resource problem is acute. Reductions in UNDP have serious repercussions not only for the entire United Nations development system  but also for the United Nations itself. I therefore appeal to all donors to maintain and  if possible  increase their contributions. Norway intends to maintain an active role in the work for a new international economic order. We regard the concept of a new international economic order as an effort to achieve the necessary combined strategy to foster just and equitable economic relations between rich and poor countries."
"102",5275,"NPL",38,1983,"ï»¿203.	 I have the honour of conveying to you  Mr. President  and the other representatives greetings from my Sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev  and his best wishes for the success of the thirty-eighth session.204.	In extending our warm felicitations to you  Sir  on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly  my delegation feels confident that  under your able and wise guidance  the Assembly will have no difficulty in achieving its desired objectives.205.	At the same time  I wish to put on record the deep appreciation of my delegation to Mr. Imre Hollai  who guided the business of the thirty-seventh session with impartiality and distinction.206.	We extend our congratulations to Saint Christopher and Nevis and welcome it as a new Member of the United Nations family.207.	I wish also to take this opportunity to pay our compliments to the Secretary-General for his exemplary conduct and contribution to the cause of international peace and development.208.	Bound by our common allegiance to the purposes and principles of the United Nations  we are assembled here to work in harmony for the promotion of peace  understanding and co-operation among nations. This has been our pledge  enshrined in the Charter and repeated every year in this very Hall. However  as we review the prevailing international situation  it does not require much perspicacity to notice the gap to our pledge and our performance. In every area of vital interest  whether political  social or economic  the contradiction is open and obvious. Over the years we have drifted so much from our course in 1983 the world finds itself confronting a situation which all of us wanted to avoid.209.	Despite the Organization's best efforts the cold winds of confrontation continue to sweep with renewed intensity. Similarly  while the frantic armaments race has aroused a deep sense of despair and danger everywhere  the increased frequency of wars and interventions challenges the very principles that we are all committed to adhere to and uphold. No less alarming is the widening gulf between rich and poor nations that has been further complicated by the reluctance of the North to enter into a meaningful dialogue.210.	The lack of political will to change with the changing realities may be blamed for many of our problems today. The danger inherent in such attitudes is nowhere more apparent than in the area of arms build-up. All of us recognize the immeasurable damage that an armed conflict could cause in this nuclear age  and yet the armaments race continues to escalate at a fast pace and in a pervasive manner as if it were a shield of salvation and not an instrument of annihilation.211.	We note with deep disappointment that the negotiations in the Committee on Disarmament on priority areas outlined in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assemblyâ the first session devoted to disarmamentâvirtually remain at a standstill. Agreements on a comprehensive nuclear-test ban have yet to materialize  despite the removal of technical obstacles. Regardless of world public opinion and the specific commitments undertaken by the major nuclear Powers in various international agreements  specifically the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons   those Powers have persisted in both the vertical and horizontal development of their nuclear arsenals. While we welcome the ongoing talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic nuclear weapons and intermediate-range nuclear missiles  we are concerned at both the apparent lack of progress and the dilatory manner in which those talks are taking place. We urge the two super-Powers to redouble their efforts in order to achieve more meaningful progress  not limiting themselves to the nuclear field but assisting and co-operating in the broader context of concluding a treaty on banning chemical weapons and initiating measures to curb the production and transfer of conventional weapons to other parts of the world. 212.	In the latter context  we have seen with great regret that more and more nations of the developing world are showing a growing tendency to arm themselves at a rate faster than that of most of the developed countries themselves. This will not only weaken the third world's stand on the question of disarmament but will also exert a severe strain on its limited resources. Contrary to what the third world countries themselves have said  this has helped to increase the flow of money in a reverse direction  that is  from the developing countries to the developed ones. Moreover  such arms build-up is also likely to generate unnecessary tension  contributing to a greater sense of insecurity in the area.213.	The accumulation of modem weapons  particularly the existence and stockpiling of nuclear arms  not only presents an ever-increasing danger to the very survival of mankind in times of war but also tends to undermine the general environment of security and dislocates the socio-economic priorities in times of peace. Acutely conscious of such disastrous consequences  my delegation joins many others in emphasizing the urgent need to halt the arms race without further delay. We should in all sincerity and seriousness begin the process of the progressive reduction and elimination of nuclear arms under effective international supervision and a verification mechanism. This should be followed by similar steps in the area of conventional arms until we reach the goal of general and complete disarmament. In view of the close interrelationship of disarmament and international security  it is essential for us  as we continue the process of disarmament  to direct our efforts at strengthening the environment of security for all States on the basis of mutual trust and respect. It also calls for the peaceful settlement of disputes  together with the implementation of effective measures for peace-keeping and peace-making.214.	While the arms build-up serves as a provocation  challenging the structure of peace  we also believe that unless and until nations adhere to the basic norms of behaviour prescribed under international law and the Charter of the United Nations  the threat to international peace and security will continue.215.	It is the tragedy of our time that even the simple norms of international conduct are often violated at the expense of human welfare. My delegation considers the recent incident involving the Korean jetliner and the loss of human lives on board to be a regrettable case and also greatly deplores the tensions that have been generated by that event.216.	The utter disregard of the principles of inter-State relationships has been a source of tension and trouble in several parts of the world. In our temptation to seek greater power and influence  we tend to forget that no nation in this age can accept subjugation  much less endure it  however great may be the suffering and sacrifice. The legitimate aspirations of all countries and peoples to remain independent and to retain their own national identity cannot be denied except at the cost of a perpetual threat to peace and stability in and around the area. It is in this perspective that my delegation views the current crises in the Middle East  South Asia  Southeast Asia  southern Africa and Central America.217.	The situation in Afghanistan continues to occupy the attention of the international community. It is essential  in order to bring about the normalization of the situation there and so that the people of the country may exercise their inalienable right of self-determination  that foreign forces be withdrawn from the country. Nepal firmly supports the efforts of the United Nations  and in particular the efforts of the Secretary-General's personal representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  to achieve a negotiated political settlement in Afghanistan.218.	Regarding the question of Kampuchea  we deeply regret that despite the efforts of the international community to find a political settlement  no progress has been made in that area. We would like once again to urge all the parties concerned to join in the efforts of the United Nations and the International Conference on Kampuchea to achieve the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the country and thus pave the way for a just political settlement of the problem.219.	In the Middle East  the situation is more volatile than ever before. My delegation has repeatedly stated its conviction that a comprehensive  just and lasting solution of the question must embrace the following three basic principles: first  withdrawal of Israel from territories occupied since 1967; secondly  respect for the rights of all States in the region  including Israel  to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; and thirdly  recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people  including their rights to a separate State. My Government believes that the participation of the Palestinian people  represented by their sole legitimate representative  the PLO  is necessary in any negotiation aimed at a comprehensive solution of the Middle East problem.220.	The question of the Middle East is also further complicated by repeated attempts to impair the sovereignty  territorial integrity and internal harmony of Lebanon and to weaken the security of its people. Nepal will support every move designed to restore full and legitimate Lebanese sovereignty over the whole of Lebanon on the basis of non-interference in its internal affairs and the withdrawal of all foreign forces.221.	Similarly  my delegation would also like to take this opportunity to renew its appeal to both Iran and Iraq  two member countries of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  to end the war between them and to seek a peaceful settlement of their disputes.222.	While the hotbeds of conflict demand our immediate attention  it is imperative at the same time that other areas of tension and their potential threats to international peace and security be neutralized. South Africa continues to be one of the focal points of tensions in international relations. The minority regime of South Africa has persistently refused to recognize the right of the oppressed people to self-determination and majority rule. Nepal has always condemned the abhorrent system of apartheid as an insult to the civilized world. We once again join the international community in urging the Security Council to take effective measures under Chapter VII of the Charter.223.	Similarly  South Africa's refusal to co-operate with the United Nations in implementing the plan for free and fair elections in Namibia under United Nations supervision has delayed the early attainment of independence by that Territory. We reiterate here our total opposition to any scheme which might make Namibia's independence contingent upon changes in situations in other countries. While my Government reaffirms its support for the people of Namibia and their representative  SWAPO  we also urge the Security Council and the members of the contact group of five Western States to intensify their efforts to bring about the early implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which is the only internationally accepted basis for the solution of the problem. In this context  my Government also supports the initiative taken recently by the Secretary-General. We are confident that other nations will also join in the support for the bold step he has taken. 224.	As regards the question of Cyprus  we continue to believe that any solution of that problem must respect the independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned character of Cyprus. With this in mind  Nepal supports the inter-communal talks held under the auspices of the Secretary-General  in keeping with the relevant United Nations resolutions.225.	My Government also continues to hold the view that the aspirations of the Korean people to national reunification must be fulfilled peacefully without outside interference.226.	The recent developments in the Caribbean and Central American region have equally been a source of concern to us. My delegation supports Security Council resolution 530 (1983)  which reaffirms the right of all countries in the region to live in peace and security  free from all foreign interference. In this context  we also welcome the initiative of the Contadora Group.227.	In our present interdependent world  just as instability in one area threatens peace and security in other comers of the globe  so disparity and economic inequality among countries cannot fail to have a negative impact on the international environment.228.	Although the inadequacy of the economic structure of the past to meet the present challenge is well recognized  we are currently at an impasse in the process of evolving a new international economic order because of the indifference of those who benefit from the status quo. A move to construct a future world system commensurate with the changing international realities must therefore be made soon in order to lay the foundation of a healthy international economic climate.229.	The high rate of inflation  protectionist policies and the deadlock in the negotiations on critical areas have aggravated the difficulties of the developing countries  which are already in a precarious position. The problems facing them  in particular the landlocked and least developed among them  are of a structural nature  and special and urgent measures are required to overcome the constraints impeding their socio-economic development. The Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries/ adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  is an outcome of the realization that that is so. We urge an immediate and full implementation of that Programme of Action.230.	The outcome of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was received with mixed feelings by my country. Nepal had expected that the developed countries would respond in a positive manner to the draft resolutions submitted by the Group of 77 on key issues concerning all the three major areasâcommodities  trade in goods and services  and financial and monetary issues. We appreciate the recognition by the developed countries of the intensity and gravity of the whole gamut of problems with which the developing countries are having to cope in the areas of trade  development  money and finance  technology  and social and institutional issues and the impact it has had on their social and economic development. But their expressions of sympathy and concern in the Held of remedial measures were not matched by an equal degree of political will. This has disappointed us  because intransigence of this nature will neither contribute anything to the growth of world trade nor assist in fostering mutuality of interest among developing and developed countries.231.	However  as one of the least developed countries we feel gratified that a compromise resolution could be drawn up in which Group B countries could accept a formulation that called for the attainment of a 0.15 per cent target for official development assistance for the least developed countries  by 1985 or as soon as possible thereafter . Their response to the least developed countries' requests for conversion of official development assistance loans into grants on a case-by-case basis  and for speedy implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action  is also appreciated.232.	We would like to stress here that no opportunity should be allowed to slip by that would enable all of us  both developed and developing countries  to gain a fair share of the wealth from world trade and development.233.	At the present time of economic insecurity my delegation believes that avenues already open for development purposes  as well as future prospects for nations  should be further widened. The meagre resources now available to multilateral bodies such as UNDP are discouraging the process of growth of developing countries. Moreover  the lack of progress in the implementation of the Nairobi Plan of Action for the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy and of the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development has added to the frustrations of the developing countries. The present myopic vision should not be allowed to obstruct the future perspective and the prospect of meaningful co-operation.234.	In the light of the present economic realities  cooperation among the developing countries assumes great significance. We are convinced of the need for taking suitable measures to ensure effective co-operation among the developing countries themselves. Consistent with the spirit of South-South co-operation  all seven countries of South Asia have recently agreed  at their meeting at the ministerial level  to launch a programme of regional co-operation in various fields of common interest and mutual benefits. We are now at the beginning of a process which we hope will continue to grow  both in spirit and in areas of co-operation  thus contributing to the welfare and stability of the region as a whole.232 . H was against the bleak background of such an international political and economic situation that the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries was held at New Delhi  from 7 to 12 March this year. The concern and commitment of the 101 countries represented theirs at the highest level find their expression in its final documents  Our crusade for peace based on political and economic justice will continue until the day every nation feels secure in its independence and all peoples share the benefits of development.233.	The non-aligned world seeks to achieve this target not as a separate bloc but as a moral and political force working in co-ordination with the United Nations system. The United Nations  with its well-defined principles  permanent structures and universal membership  has the necessary prestige and prerequisites to serve as both an ideal and an instrument of peace. Nepal  which has full faith in the Organization's principles and purposes  will continue to support all measures to strengthen the effectiveness and operational capacity of the United Nations in its efforts to create a safer and better world as envisaged in the Charter.234.	At this point I cannot fail to express our great appreciation for the valuable support and assistance extended to us by the various bodies and specialized agencies of the United Nations in our development efforts. Nepal believes that there can be no alternative to the United Nations in realizing the goals of international peace and security and promoting the cause and course of detente  disarmament and socio-economic advancement for all peoples.235.	Our ultimate desire for peace and development is embodied in our proposition that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. This proposition is consistent not only with our traditional national ethos but also with the principles of non-alignment and the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The zone of peace proposal will not only help institutionalize peace in our country  thus enabling us to meet the growing challenges of development in an atmosphere of security and stability; it will also contribute to the cause of peace and stability in our neighbourhood. I take this opportunity to thank all those countries which have supported our proposal.236.	In conclusion let me once again reaffirm our support for the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. The delicate instrument designed for the maintenance of peace and stability which was constructed nearly 40 years ago by our founding fathers still has a major role to play in the changing realities of our tidies. In this endeavour all the nations have significant contributions to make. My country will not lag behind in working for a viable structure of peace which is so essential for the survival of the human race. 237.	"
"103",5339,"NZL",38,1983,"ï»¿266.	 Sir  may I begin by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. This is an appropriate recognition both of your own personal achievements and of the important role your country is playing in international affairs. New Zealand will fully support you in your endeavour to make this session a productive one  just as we fully support the Secretary-General in his efforts to make the United Nations more effective in the search for peace and development.267.	Less than two weeks ago I had the pleasure of representing New Zealand at the independence celebrations of the new State of Saint Christopher and Nevis. Today I join others in congratulating the international community's newest Member in being represented for the first time at the United Nations. It is a salutary reminder to us all that one of the first acts of such a young and small country has been to register  in a formal sense  its interest in this Organization. We in New Zealand have no difficulty understanding that. By most counts  we are ourselves a young and small country. Our welfare can be profoundly influenced for better or worse by external developments very largely outside our control. Some four decades ago  when the Charter of the United Nations was negotiated  we held high hopes that through international co-operation we would achieve a measure of political and economic security which a country like New Zealand could not hope to realize alone.268.	Time and experience have tempered our earlier expectations. In recent years we have seen the Soviet Union invade Afghanistan in flagrant violation of the Charter. Similarly  the invasion of Kampuchea by Viet Nam has been followed by nearly five years of occupation  thereby preventing the political settlement that the Assembly has urged repeatedly. The essential character of the apartheid system remains intact  in spite of the strongest condemnation by the international community. Day by day we witness the continuing suffering of various peoples and countries in the Middle East  indicating to us once more that peace and security cannot be achieved by force of arms alone. In one of those areas of conflict- LebanonâNew Zealand welcomes the cease-fire and hopes that it paves the way for a more lasting settlement among the parties involved.269.	The Antarctic region stands in sharp contrast to these troubled areas throughout the world. For over 20 years the Antarctic Treaty"" has succeeded in making Antarctica an area of international co-operation and preventing it from becoming the object of international dissension. The Treaty is open to any Member of the United Nations and it remains in force indefinitely. It makes a very effective contribution to achieving the purposes of the United Nations. We assume that any study carried out by the Organization will fully recognize this fact and seek to reinforce the Treaty rather than to weaken it.270.	Antarctica is one example of what can be achieved by practical international co-operation. The South Pacific is another. At least once a year the heads of all the independent Governments in our region meet together in the South Pacific Forum to talk over common problems and to work out ways of dealing with them. So far we have succeeded in keeping our part of the world peaceful. We are  however  concerned about the continuation of nuclear testing in the South Pacific. We appreciate the offer made by the French Government to allow qualified experts from countries in the area to visit the testing site and check the effectiveness of the safety precautions followed by the French authorities. But the question is not merely one of safety precautions; it is about the use of a relatively peaceful part of the world for an essentially warlike purpose.271.	We realize that this problem cannot be dealt with on a purely regional basis  and that is why New Zealand  like other countries in the South Pacific and elsewhere  attaches great importance to the negotiation of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. To be effective  such a treaty would need to be fully verifiable. Given good will and effort on all sides  we believe this problem can be overcome. The conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty would do much to strengthen the 1968 Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to limit the nuclear arms race.272.	The part of the world in which New Zealanders live is one of the few areas of relative tranquillity. Nevertheless we are from time to time sharply reminded of the limitations both of international law and of normally accepted standards of civilized behaviour. The ruthless and totally unjustified attack by the Soviet Union on a civilian airliner has provided such a reminder. The Soviet Union must accept full responsibility for this act of brutality. What is truly outrageous is that the Soviet Government claims this action was fully in accordance with Soviet law. In plain language they seem to be saying that if tomorrow a civilian airliner from any one of our countries mistakenly flew over Soviet territory then they reserve the right to shoot it down.273.	The limits to international co-operation are thus plainâall to plainâto see  yet the membership of the United Nations remains intact  and we welcome to the fold a new Member from the Caribbean region.274.	The reason  I suggest  is obvious. However difficult it has been to develop habits of international cooperation on these major political issues  there is no practical alternative for the overwhelming majority of countries.275.	I believe that today this applies with equal force to the international economy. International economic linkages are such that in practical terms no single country any longer has freedom of action. That is the consequence of several decades of sustained growth in world trade  production and investment. The interdependent world economy has arrived on our doorsteps  and the world has little idea how to manage it.276.	The theory behind economic interdependence is not new. We always knew that the health of any individual economy was linked in no small measure with the health of its major trading and investment partners. There is nothing novel in pointing to the close connections between  say  trade and financial flows.277.	What is new is that the practical significance of those linkages has increased to such an extent and with such rapidity that we have failed to adapt sufficiently our institutions and our thinking so as to be able to cope with those linkages.278.	New Zealand respects the competence of the principal economic institutions such as IMF  the World Bank and GATT. As originally conceived after the war  they each had their roleâIMF was concerned principally with short-term balance of payment adjustment and maintaining exchange rate stability  the Bank was concerned with development and GATT dealt with trade.279.	The growth of interdependence has totally blurred these tidy dividing lines. The long-term resolution of the debt burden built up over recent years is inextricably linked with the resolution of the problems of protectionism. The old phrase that debt is deferred trade sums up the reality that it is only through increased exports that the interest and principal repayments can ever be met.If protectionism chokes off that possibility  then the debt problem assumes very different proportions.280.	It is not just a question of interdependence between issues such as debt and trade  development and growth. It is also a question of the interdependence between countries  between regions  between North and South.281.	The current economic crisis facing many less developed countries has obscured the fact that until recently the growth performance of many of those countries was particularly strong. It has been estimated that in the 25-year period 1950 to 1975 the per capita gross Rational product of the developing countries as a whole grew at an average rate of 3.5 per cent per annum. Even though we knew this left a number of countries with unacceptable levels of poverty  this was a remarkable historic achievement. It was matched by creditable progress in such crucial indices as a steady rise in life expectancy and adult literacy.282.	Because of these developments it was clear by the beginning of the 1980s that it was no longer accurate to see the concept of dependence flowing one way only. By the 1980s the economic health of developed countries was beginning to be influenced profoundly by the economic performance of their less developed neighbours.283.	This is what interdependence means. It was visibly demonstrated last year when the expected recovery of the developed and affluent countries members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OFCD] did not eventuate in the second half of 1982 very largely because of a sudden downturn in the demand for their exports to the less developed world. Faced with acute financing difficulties caused by a contraction in commercial bank lending  many of the more heavily indebted countries had no option but to pursue adjustment policies based largely on slashing imports. This impaired their own development needs. It impaired the OECD's recovery.284.	From the suffering of the Second World War a system for international economic co-operation was developed. Those who designed that system had in mind a world economy that was very different from the interdependent world economy we live in today. In many respects those post-war arrangements achieved their central objectives. Many of the key elements  such as currency convertibility  are still as relevant today as they were then. The successes of that system of trade and payments created the global economy we have today. I believe the international community must now move on to the next phase of international economic co-operation and begin the task of managing that interdependence.285.	To describe the scope and magnitude of that task I have used the term ""a new Bretton Woods"". For over a year  at a variety of international forums  I have urged the international community to initiate the comprehensive examination of the world's trade and payments system that is the first necessary step towards a new Bretton Woods. The conference as such should be regarded as the last step  the culmination of the most careful preparatory process of analysis and discussion.286.	During that time there has been considerable debate over the future of the trade and payments system. There have also been unmistakable signs of a recovery in the United States economy  and the immediate danger of default by the most heavily indebted countries has been averted by various rescue operations.287.	The key question  I believe  is whether the recovery and these rescue operations will in practice set back the growing consensus in favour of a comprehensive examination of the underlying structural difficulties facing the world economy. There is a serious danger that this will be the case. The remedy  however  lies entirely in our own hands.288.	Let me first summarize the international debate as I believe it has evolved over that period. In February 1983 the Brandt Commission's second report proposed a major review of the world's trade and payments system."" In March the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries endorsed the Indian Prime Minister's call for a conference on money and finance for development. Following the meeting of OECD ministers in May  at which I repeated my call for a Bretton Woods-type conference  the French President made a very similar proposal. Then  at the Williamsburg Summit the leaders of the industrialized countries issued a somewhat tentative call for their ministers of finance to work with the Managing Director of IMF to prepare the groundwork for what might develop into a high-level international monetary conference. However qualified that endorsement may have been  it was a response from the developed world to the growing weight of opinion favouring a careful examination of these international economic issues. The middle ground  if not clearly delineated  was at least becoming visible.289.	Finally  at the meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers  which concluded in Trinidad and Tobago less than two weeks ago  ministers of finance from 44 countries  representing the diversity of wealth  population and size that is the key characteristic of that grouping  commended the general thrust of a major report entitled ""Towards a New Bretton Woods"".290.	This was a report compiled by eminent experts from nine Commonwealth countries. Its work on conditionally  liquidity problems  the role of special drawing rights  protectionism and sovereign debt  to mention only a few of the issues covered in the report  will  I hope  be sifted and refined. As the first attempt by an international institution to outline the agenda for such a fundamental examination of the trade and payments system  it deserves careful consideration by the wider international community.291.	Surveying the debate over the past 12 months as a whole  therefore  international opinion seems to have been evolving in a promising direction. We were beginning to move away from the sterile confrontations that have been the hallmark of international economic debate even in recent years.292.	However  we now face the possibility that the recoveryâwelcome as it isâmay have the somewhat predictable result of unravelling a good deal of that growing consensus. If the international community has been increasingly ready to consider the scope for changes to the trade and payments system  it has no doubt been due to the long period of stagflation we have been through. Equally  now that the first clear signs of a recovery in the United States and certain other industrial economies are evident  some of the pressure to examine these long- term issues is off. It may be only realistic to expect that debate to be influenced by short-term fluctuation in the real economy. It would  I suggest  be reasonable to expect a little more vision.293.	In spite of the misgivings of many Governors and the continuing  though privately expressed  disquiet of the international banking community  a message to emerge from the annual meetings of IMF and the World Bank was  regrettably  all too clear. With some of the major industrial countries there was a mood that can be expressed quite simply: now that the recovery is under way  let us put aside all this talk of changes to the trade and payments system.294.	I believe that view is more than short-sighted; it is tragically misplaced. The recovery of industrial countries  in itself undoubtedly the best piece of economic news we have had for some years  will not come to grips with the deep-seated changes that have occurred in the world economy since the formation of the Bretton Woods institutions.295.	In 1982 the world economy went backwards. World production declined by an estimated 2 per cent  and the volume of world trade declined by 2.5 per cent. Had this continued into 1983 I believe it would have put nearly impossible strains on world economic and political stability. The recovery certain developed countries are now experiencing has to be seen against that perspective. It has turned the tide against the forces of contraction of world output and trade unprecedented in our post-war experience. The recovery in demand will strengthen many commodity prices and thus may offer some relief to those countries which  like New Zealand  have suffered disastrous declines in their terms of trade during the last decade. Finally  however  the recovery is not a panacea for the problems of debt  protectionism and development.296.	In the first place the recovery is cyclical in nature and confined to relatively few countries. Even for them the persistence of high interest rates is a serious threat to sustained recovery of their economies.297.	Recovery will not tackle the underlying roots of protectionism  since clearly  the growth of protectionist action predates the recession. Protectionism  which is by no means confined to the OECD countries  will persist in the developed world if only because no one is predicting growth rates which will reduce the number of unemployed  roughly 35 million  in the OECD area.298.	Recovery will not do much to alleviate the debt burdens of many developing countries. The Commonwealth study ""Towards a New Bretton Woods"" estimates that there are as many as 40 countries which have been reported to have agreed to debt reschedulings or to be in substantial payments arrears. In the 10-month period to June 1983 the value of cross-border debt being renegotiated with commercial banks has been calculated as being over 20 times larger than in any previous year. Debt of this magnitude is a powerful force for uncertainty  a threat to the recovery and a source of instability for these Governments  whatever their political system.299.	Nor can I see any reason why the recovery should reverse the moodâso obvious in most countriesâwhich has been aptly described as ""aid weariness"". The New Zealand political system is no more immune to that than any other democratic country. However  my experience with our small but highly effective aid programmes in the independent countries of the South Pacific has convinced me that the prevailing modem view of aid is profoundly misplaced.300.	I have advocated putting aid on a firmer basis  possibly by issuing special drawing rights to the countries in greatest need. In any such distribution there may be a useful role for the World Bank  in part because that would put the Bank's finances on a more assured basis.301.	These are only some of the medium- and longer- term issues which I believe the modest recovery in the OECD area will do little to address.302.	The ideas  the issues involved  although technical in nature  have profound political implications. Many countries represented in the Assembly have witnessed directly the political consequences that flow from economic dislocation. Economic growth and stable financial markets will not of themselves preserve the fabric of world peace  but they are powerful positive forces all the same. Many of the elements of the post-war system of economic co-operation are under strain. I believe we  as an international community  now need to develop new political levers to tackle some of the underlying difficulties. We must move beyond the ad hoc responses that have developed to cope with severe  long-term current account deficits. We must reassure heavily indebted countries that there will be adequate financing available while they pursue the long-term process of structural adjustment. The original political mandate of GATT  which is now all but exhausted  must be renewed.303.	The difficulty in all this is to move beyond general expressions of concern to initiate a process which might come to grips with some of these fundamental issues facing the world trade and payments system.304.	Of course  if the complacent mood prevalent in some countries persists there is little that can be done. In that case  the middle ground that I believe was becoming visible until very recently will quickly disappear. We will quit the field and leave it to extremists of varying points of view. We will return to the dubious pleasure of the sterile confrontations of past years.305.	I do not pretend to have a blueprint for the process that might lead to a comprehensive examination of the trade and payments system. There are many possible approaches  involving different timetables and different combinations of people and institutions. The study ""Towards a new Bretton Woods""  to which I referred earlier  has one such proposal worthy of the Assembly's consideration. Ultimately  the process must be tailored to the needs of the main participants so as to command their support.306.	It is not hard  however  to describe in general terms the criteria for a successful examination of the trade and payments system.307.	First  the basic work must be undertaken by experts of the highest standing  otherwise its analytical competence would be subject to easy and probably fatal challenge.308.	Secondly  these experts must enjoy the confidence of major Governments and have ready access to their political advice. In that way  we might avoid proposals that are completely outside the limits of political possibility.309.	Thirdly  any such group must be of manageable size. In my view this implies a small group of around 15 to 25 members broadly representative of the international community and working closely with the major international economic institutions. We would probably end up with something analogous to the structure of the Interim Committee and the Executive Board of IMF. Unlike the Interim Committee  however  it would be concerned with all the fundamental long-term trade and payments issues  rather than simply determining the current policy of IMF.310.	Fourthly  a conference  involving participation on a far wider international basis  should be seen as a conclusion rather than a beginning. The Commonwealth finance ministers saw a Bretton Woods-type conference in this context very much as an end to the process rather than a commencement.311.	It is more difficult to be definitive about the timetable when agreement on the process described above still escapes our grasp. I believe there is an urgent need to begin the task now  and I believe that the general proposition has wide support. If we accept the projections which imply an annual rate of growth in the key industrial countries of 3 to 4 per cent into 1984  then this gives us some flexibility to implement any changes agreed at what we might call the study group level. If we delay the start of our examination too long  then we face the possibility of yet another cyclical downturn in the world economy. A return to an even less auspicious macro-economic climate could sound the death-knell to the implementation stage of the exercise.312.	The point requires no labouring. There is a real and pressing need to get on with the job of re-examining the system and working out how to adapt it to the needs of the period we live in. Delay is dangerous. To avert the threat  we should aim to have broad international agreement to implementing changes in the trade and payments system by  say  1985. The process of preparing for it should begin straight away  certainly by the beginning of 1984. The time for action is now. "
"104",5384,"OMN",38,1983,"99.	Mr. President  I should like to begin by expressing my congratulations to you on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your wisdom and expertise in international affairs will ensure that the business of the session will be conducted in the best possible manner.100.	I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  for his praiseworthy efforts during the past session.101.	Allow me to extend our sincere congratulations to Saint Christopher and Nevis for having gained independence and admission to membership of the United Nations.102.	We should also like to commend the Secretary- General and express our appreciation for what he has accomplished during his first year as Secretary-General. We wish him continued success in dealing with the difficult tasks and complicated problems facing us in the world today.103.	I had hoped that I would be able to draw a more pleasant picture of the international situation than I did last year. Unfortunately  the reality of the situation precludes this. I believe that this view is shared by the speakers who have preceded me. Indeed  no tangible progress has taken place in international relations and  although it is easy enough for us to arrange endless meetings  we are still helpless in the face of the multitude of crises which we face. In fact  the agenda of this session is the best indication of the paralysis which has stricken the will of the international community  a paralysis which is preventing us from doing what we all believe constitutes wisdom  propriety and civilized approach in dealing with the issues before us.104.	The question of Palestine  which lies at the heart of the Middle East crisis  heads our agenda session after session. The problem of the Palestinian people is one of the most serious problems threatening peace and security in our region  and perhaps in the entire world.105.	The numerous United Nations resolutions on the question of Palestine reflect the will of the international community and comprise the foundation of an objective attempt to establish a just and lasting peace. A number of proposals have been made and intensive Arab and international efforts have been exerted  all with a view to settling this question. However  in defiance of the will of the international community  Israel has frustrated these efforts.106.	The establishment and expansion of Israeli settlements  the application of Israeli laws and legislation to the occupied Arab territories  the expulsion of the Arab population and the expropriation of their property  the changes in the historical and cultural character of the area and the violation of places sacred to various religions  in particular of the Holy City of Jerusalem  all constitute a flagrant disregard of the rules of international law and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. These acts exemplify the expansionist policies of Israel.107.	We have also seen United Nations reports on the situation of the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip which indicate that Israel is planning to deprive the Arab villages in these territories of such essential services as electricity and water in order to subdue the Arab population and as a prelude to converting those territories into new Jewish settlements. The reports also indicate that Israel is still pursuing its plans to link the economy of the occupied Arab territories to that of Israel.108.	The continuation of the Israeli settlement policy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank prevents the return of the Palestinians to those territories. It is also designed to create a new reality according to which the Palestinians would be denied the exercise of their sovereign rights in the territories  in preparation for the eventual annexation of those lands by Israel.109.	We believe that a lasting and just solution of the Middle East question requires Israel's recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. It also requires facilitating the return of Palestinians now living abroad to their homeland in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  with a guarantee that they will not be subject to oppression or to restrictions on the free expression of their political views or the exercise of their legitimate inalienable rights.110.	In the summer of last year  Israeli forces invaded the territory of the sister State of Lebanon. Now  one year later  despite the fact that Israel has failed to achieve its objectives  its armed forces are still occupying a large area of Lebanese territory under various false pretexts  in spite of the negotiations which have taken place between the Lebanese Government and Israel with a view to achieving the withdrawal of Israeli forces.111.	The critical situation in Lebanon  which is a consequence of the Israeli invasion  has compelled that country to enter into negotiations with Israel. Lebanon has seen these negotiations as a political opportunity to achieve the withdrawal of the Israeli invading forces and all foreign forces from its territory and the consequent restoration of its national sovereignty. The Sultanate of Oman supports the choice made by Lebanon of its own free will to exercise its rights and regain sovereignty over all parts of Lebanese soil.110. It is incumbent upon the international community to support the desire of the Lebanese Government to see the withdrawal of all foreign forces from its territory  and to be given the opportunity to rebuild what has been destroyed and restore the original character of Lebanon as the world knew it before  a peaceful land of civilization and culture.HI. The recent achievement of a cease-fire in Lebanon is a very important step towards securing peace there. The international community should help the concerned parties within Lebanon to begin a national dialogue  so that sisterly Lebanon can regain its national unity  sovereignty and independence  which is what we all wish for.112.	The Gulf region is threatened by an unprecedentedly large oil slick  which continues to grow. It is created by the daily flow of thousands of barrels of oil from the Nayruz oil field in Iran  and it poses unimaginable environmental risks and jeopardizes marine life in the Gulf region. Furthermore  the safety of navigation is threatened by the mines floating in the Gulf.113.	All political efforts to remedy the situation have been frustrated because of the fierce war raging between these two Moslem neighbours  Iran and Iraq. The dire consequences of this destructive war  which we feel is absolutely senseless  are felt by the entire region. The repeated threats to close the Strait of Hormuz and to interrupt maritime traffic in the Gulf will lead to our region becoming an arena for direct confrontation between the super-Powers.114.	The continued war between Iraq and Iran has proved a serious drain on the human and material resources of those two countries. Already  thousands of their people have been killed in this war and immense sums of money have been wasted. Moreover  the war has not merely had serious consequences for the economies of these two States but has actually set back their development severely.115.	For their own benefit the two countries should exercise wisdom and restraint in order to overcome all the obstacles preventing them from putting an end to this destructive  futile war and should use their resources for the good of their peoples instead of wasting them so recklessly.116.	Therefore  the Sultanate of Oman urges the Iranian Government to follow the example of Iraq by responding to the appeal '  and peaceful initiatives of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Gulf Co-operation Council designed to bring peace and security to the whole region.117.	Almost four years have passed since the Soviet Union militarily occupied Afghanistan in violation of all international norms and laws and of its legal commitments under the Charter of the United Nations. The loss of life  destruction and displacement caused by that occupation have affected the majority of the Afghan people and many of them have been made homeless  quite apart from having been deprived of all their internationally recognized rights.118.	At the time of the invasion  the international community was quick to denounce this flagrant Soviet act in many forums. It demanded that the Soviet Union withdraw its invading forces from Afghanistan and respect the sovereignty  independence and non-aligned status of that country. Foremost among those international appeals directed to the Soviet Union concerning Afghanistan are the resolutions of this General Assembly  of which Oman had the honour of being a sponsor. The Soviets  however  have not as yet heeded these resolutions  nor have they shown any intention of finding a solution to this tragic problem. On the contrary  the number of their troops stationed in Afghanistan has increased and their operations against the valiant Afghan people have been intensified.119.	We are greatly disturbed also by reports concerning the use by the Soviets of internationally prohibited weapons against the people of Afghanistan  in violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925? and in defiance of the resolutions adopted by this Assembly which seek to impose a complete and effective ban on any use of prohibited weapons.120.	The persistence of international strife in Afghanistan constitutes a direct political threat to the security  independence and sovereignty of the States of the Indian Ocean region. That is why we support all unofficial international talks carried out under the auspices of the United Nations aimed at finding a formula that will guarantee the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and the exercise by the Afghan people of their basic right to freedom  independence and the free choice of their own path towards the building of an independent  non-aligned State. At the same time  peace in Afghanistan will ensure security  stability and co-operation among neighbouring States.121.	Oman shares common aspirations and hopes with the African continent  which is seeking a solution to the explosive situation in South Africa. Oman condemns apartheid  the universally deplored policy being carried out by the Government of South Africa. We look forward to the day when the people of Namibia will be able to exercise fully its right to self-determination and independence. We hope that the efforts of the group of Western States which is engaged in talks on this question will  against all the odds  be brought to a successful conclusion.122.	Oman calls on the international community to make further efforts to ensure the fulfilment of the aspirations of the African peoples to independence and liberty  and to oppose all attempts by foreign Powers to intervene in their internal affairs or to drag them into their spheres of influence.123.	In this regard  we view with grave concern the critical situation in the Horn of Africa  which has come about as a result of military adventurism on the part of various foreign Powers  both large and small. We demand that these acts of intervention in the affairs of the region be stopped immediately  to prevent its falling victim to expansionist attempts by foreign Powers to dominate African States and exploit them politically  economically and militarily.124.	Kampuchea  like Afghanistan  remains under the yoke of a foreign Power  namely  the Vietnamese army supported by the Soviet Union  in spite of various General Assembly resolutions on this subject and other international peals. Since Viet Nam chose to ignore all those appeals  as well as international laws and norms and the principles of the Charter when it decided to resort to the use of force to invade and occupy Kampuchea  the security and political situation in South-East Asia has continued to deteriorate as a result of the continuation of the occupation.125.	Oman calls for the immediate withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea  thus enabling the Kampuchean people to exercise their right to self-determination and solve their internal conflicts without foreign interference.126.	In this connection  we should like to express our support for all the efforts of ASEAN on both the regional and international levels to achieve a just political solution of the question of Kampuchea which will in turn guarantee security and stability in that area  which has suffered greatly from conflicts and wars.127.	In Central America we have seen how foreign forces from outside the Americas have sought to exploit the existing social and economic problems and use them as a pretext for intervention in the internal affairs of that area in order to gain new spheres of influence.128.	The fighting that is now raging in the region meets the purposes of the intervening foreign States. Therefore  all Latin American States are urged not to fall into that trap which in the past was set for other States. They should do their utmost to preserve stability and adhere to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of nations and employ all their resources for their economic and social development  instead of conflict and war.129.	The Sultanate of Oman expresses its support for the efforts now being made by the Contadora Group  which calls for common dialogue among those States of the region which are in conflict in order to arrive at a peaceful settlement of their disputes.130.	The Sultanate of Oman views with mounting concern the escalating tension in the Indian Ocean area as a result of the rivalry between the two super-Powers. The results of such strife are particularly clear in the case of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan  which poses a direct threat to the sovereignty and independence of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean  in particular  and to international peace and security in general.131.	The deterioration of the security situation in our area is a result of non-compliance with General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  entitled ""Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace""  and all other relevant resolutions.132.	Our delegation has placed great hopes in the work of the Roc Committee on the Indian Ocean; however  our hopes have diminished with each successive session because the Committee is paralysed by differences existing between two of its members. This situation has prevented the implementation of several General Assembly resolutions on the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean  which was originally to be held at Colombo in 1981.133.	In spite of the obstacles facing the work of the Ad hoc Committee  we hope that all delegations will display the political resolve necessary to overcome present differences and to work together closely to implement General Assembly resolution 37/96  which calls for the convening of the Conference not later than the first half of 1984  which will be the first phase of the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.134.	Our world faces the very real danger of a nuclear war which would result in complete annihilation. According to available statistics  the nuclear arsenals of the super-Powers contain enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world 10 times over. This makes it even more imperative to continue the talks between the big Powers to curb the arms race. 135.	The Sultanate of Oman  like all other peace-loving countries  considers that the big Powers have an obligation to maintain international peace and security. It therefore appeals to them to continue their efforts to eliminate the threat of war  especially nuclear war. The entire international community will benefit from that. Also  we believe that all international negotiations and efforts should be directed towards the noble goal of achieving general and complete disarmament.136.	The international economy has been witnessing a severe recession of a magnitude unprecedented since the 1930s. The economic pressures spawned by this recession have led to new trade barriers and a sharp decline in the rate of economic growth and the flow of international capital. The current international crisis has had a particularly devastating effect on the developing countries  impeding their development goals and reducing their ability to service their debts. It has also substantially reduced the availability of loans made by commercial banks and industrialized nations to developing countries  thus compounding the liquidity problems already being experienced by those countries. In addition  developing countries are also severely affected by the fluctuations in exchange rates  adverse terms of trade  substantial increases in the cost of capital  inadequate demand for their exports  increasing resort to protectionist policies and unfavourable conditions for the transfer of technology. These factors have been extremely damaging to the economies of the developing countries  inhibiting their economic growth and producing huge deficits in the balance of payments and an increase in the foreign debt.137.	The developing countries had hoped that during the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  the developed countries would have demonstrated greater sensitivity to the problems facing them. The failure of the Conference was a great disappointment to the developing countries and a set-back to their hopes of finding suitable solutions to the aforementioned problems.138.	We believe that the developing countries must not give in to despair and that all countries  especially the industrialized ones  should  in a spirit of responsibility and farsightedness  examine the modalities for narrowing the gap between them and reconciling their differences of opinion.139.	Oman  as a developing country  is particularly interested in global economic negotiations and once again calls upon the developed countries to aid the developing ones in improving their rate of economic growth and in reducing the burden of their indebtedness. Oman would also like to request the developed countries to take a more flexible and candid approach to all such negotiations.140.	We feel that the international community must  more than ever before  exert every effort to achieve the goals and objectives of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade   in order to resolve the current economic crisis.141.	In conclusion  I should like to welcome the report of the Secretary-General on the work  f the Organization  a report which is clear in form and candid in substance. The Secretary-General is presenting us for the second time with a realistic picture of the crises that the world is currently facing. He did not limit himself to diagnosis of the crises from which the Organization is suffering  but went further to suggest a number of remedies aimed at restoring confidence in the credibility of the Organization. He has tried to present an objective image of the existing state of international relations  including the indifference of some States to the principles embodied in the Charter and to the possible role the United Nations could play as the main multilateral organization responsible for the preservation of international peace and security.142.	The gravity of the international situation requires us to pay due attention to the content of the report. We hope that an open exchange of opinions will ensue during this session  concerning the ways and means of strengthening the Organization and that such an exchange will be founded on the decision taken by the General Assembly on the subject at its last session."
"105",5430,"PAK",38,1983,"ï»¿202.	 I should like to begin by extending to Mr. Jorge Illueca my sincere felicitations on his election to the presidency of the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to his statesmanship and to the profound respect that he enjoys in the international community for his dedication to the cause of peace and human dignity. It is also an acknowledgement of his great country's role in upholding the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and in the advancement of its objectives.203.	I also convey my delegation's sentiments of great esteem to his predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of the Hungarian People's Republic  who guided the work of the thirty-seventh session with such distinction and success 204.	I take this opportunity to greet warmly the Government and people of Saint Christopher and Nevis on the independence of their country and to welcome the entry of this new nation into the international community. Pakistan looks forward to friendly relations with Saint Christopher and Nevis and to fruitful co-operation with it.205.	It gives me great pleasure to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General. He has brought great distinction and wide experience to this high office and his dedicated efforts towards the solution of the problems confronting the international community merit our deepest appreciation.206.	Last year  in his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General deplored the continuing deterioration of the political and security climate and urged the international community to arrest and reverse this trend by adhering to the principles and purposes of the Charter. It is a matter of grave concern that  a year later  the international situation shows no sign of improvement and the Secretary-General has been obliged to repeat his earlier warning in his current report.207.	We are living in a dangerous world of growing nuclear arsenals  increasing tensions and a worsening economic malaise. We are witnessing a regrettable weakening of the resolve of States to settle their disputes in accordant with the spirit of the Charter. There is an alarming increase in the resort to force. Recent violations of the principles of non-interference in the affairs of sovereign States presage a return to the politics of coercion and pressure against less powerful countries. This poses a serious threat to the sovereignty and security of small nations. Equally evident is the inability of smaller nations to act collectively to protect themselves from the competing interests and designs of the great Powers.208.	The failure of detente and the spiralling arms race  particularly in respect of nuclear weapons  the lack of meaningful progress in the dialogue between the superpowers and attempts to establish new spheres of influence are developments which have brought the world to the brink of catastrophe. The tragic incident of the Korean airliner and the consequent heightening of tension in East- West relations remind us of the real danger of a single incident causing a wider conflict and also the need to exercise restraint in order to avert a major crisis.209.	The economic landscape is equally bleak. It generates its own tensions which  if left unattended  could prove disastrous for the whole world. The industrialized countries must recognize that the demand for the new international economic order is not an anguished plea for charity but represents the legitimate aspirations of hundreds of millions of people.210.	The ravages of global recession have brought into vivid focus the fragility of the existing international economic system and  even more  the interdependence of all economies.211.	The crisis in the international economic system continues to be a cause for profound concern  both on account of its devastating impact on the economies of developing countries and  more importantly  because of the absence of any real indication that the international community is ready for a common endeavour to seek solutions to problems afflicting all nations. All efforts to seek structural adjustments in the system  or to adopt measures required to alleviate the conditions of the developing countries  have met with stubborn resistance by the developed countries.212.	Several distinguished world leaders have spoken eloquently on the serious consequences of the present economic crisis. The crisis has frustrated the hopes of the countries of the third world for improvement in the quality of life of their peoples and they are faced with large-scale social unrest which could lead to political upheaval.213.	The failure of the international community to act in concert to deal with the situation has served to aggravate it. The near breakdown in the international financing system is either driving the developing nations towards bankruptcy and default or pushing them deeper into debt liabilities from which they cannot recover. The growing debt problem  which is only one aspect of the international economic crisis  demonstrates the failure of existing institutions.214.	The goal of a new international economic order remains as distant as ever. This is evident from the desultory action in implementing the provisions of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Furthermore  while we have heard many statements expressing a commitment to launch global negotiations  no meaningful development has taken place in this vital area. Successive initiatives to start a dialogue aimed at resolving the crisis in the global economic system have suffered a similar fate.215.	It would be naive to assume that the signs of recovery visible in some of the industrialized nations represent indications of an upturn in the world economy. While this trend may be welcome  it cannot by itself resolve the problems of the global economic system  and its impact on the economies of the developing countries would be negligible and too slow. On the other hand  the slightest downward trend in the economies of the developed countries violently and disproportionately affects the economies of the developing countries which do not possess the resilience to withstand vicissitudes in the economic situation of the developed world. The quest for the new international economic order envisages a restructuring which is not aimed at the disruption of the economies of the North  but at providing the developing countries with ways and means to contribute effectively to a just and healthy international economic environment that would prove equally beneficial to the developed countries.216.	The interdependence of the world today is so great that it is no longer possible to compartmentalize recovery on the basis of restrictive national needs. The nations of the South as well as the North must seek a more equitable and just system that promotes socio-economic development for all  instead of accentuating existing inequalities. It was to be hoped that the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development would have directed its efforts to redressing some of the more pressing problems  but  unfortunately  the results have served to heighten differences and disparities. The stalemate in global negotiations is heading towards a self- perpetuating deadlock. The international community can no longer afford to remain preoccupied with voicing their respective grievances. Mutual recriminations must give way to reconciliation. The time has come for speedy and decisive action. We may not expect to achieve everything in one step  but the North and South together must make a start in dealing with these complex issues.217.	At the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in March  the President of Pakistan suggested the elements of global economic co-operation which could combat the crisis confronting the world economy.218.	First  for the revival of the North and the survival of the South  the developed countries which have material and technological superiority over the developing countries should collectively dismantle all barriers to free trade.219.	Secondly  for resolving the gigantic problem of international debt that affects the North as well as the South  the two should evolve by common agreement an orderly and equitable system of debt management.220.	Thirdly  the South should accept the need for better economic management and efficient utilization of its own natural resources. It must increasingly mobilize its own creative energies  both on a national and on a collective basis  and for this purpose prepare a concrete blueprint for South-South co-operation.221.	Fourthly  it is necessary that all countries give full support to the concept of multilateralism and to increasing the capacity of the international financial institutions to enable them to play a more effective role in initiating world economyâs recovery and in accelerating the economic advance of the developing countries.222.	Fifthly  in view of the huge and urgent needs of the developing countries for energy investment  serious consideration must be given to setting up arrangements encompassing contributions from Governments  private banks  and suppliers of equipment for financing the capital-intensive and technologically-complex projects in the energy sector.223.	These are some of the measures which  in our view  can go a long way in helping a transition towards a more equitable system of global economic relations.224.	Peace and security are basic elements for the progress of mankind. After witnessing two destructive world wars in this century  humanity cannot afford a third conflict. But unfortunately the international political climate is marred by a growing turbulence  and world peace and security  the fundamental objectives of the United Nations  are being increasingly threatened through blatant violations of the sovereignty and independence of small States.225.	The unresolved Middle East problem constitutes the most serious obstacle to world peace. It is a threat that can  at any time  lead to a major catastrophe. It is also the saga of resolute determination by the brave Palestinian people not to be subdued by the might of Israeli arms. The recent history of the Middle East is one of continuing aggression by Israel against the Palestinian and Arab peoples  the latest victim being Lebanon  whose sovereignty and territorial integrity have been flagrantly violated in utter disregard of all principles of international law and conduct. We believe that any durable and lasting solution to the Middle East problem must ensure Israeli evacuation from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  and must restore the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State in their own homeland.226.	History has repeatedly demonstrated that oppression cannot endure. A valiant and determined people invariably defeat their oppressors. The future will confirm the lessons of the past. We salute the courageous Palestinian people who  through their undaunted heroism and sacrifice  have provided eloquent testimony to the justice of their cause.227.	We would also like to pay tribute to the sagacity and wisdom of the Arab leaders who came out with far- reaching proposals in the Fez plan""  which contained a comprehensive framework and provided a major initiative for the attainment of peace in this strife-torn region. The Arab heads of State thus demonstrated  yet again  the willingness of the Arab world and the Palestinian people to attain peace with dignity and honour. Israeli rejection of the plan has only served to confirm once again its aggressive and expansionist policies.228.	In our immediate neighbourhood  a small independent non-aligned State  Afghanistan  has been subjected to foreign military intervention. True to their traditions  the people of Afghanistan have  by their indomitable courage  demonstrated that massive force cannot vanquish a people determined to preserve their independence and identity. For four years now  their tenacious resistance has continued with sustained intensity throughout the length and breadth of the country. Yet they also look to the international community to ensure respect for the sacrosanct principles of non-use of force and non-intervention in international relations and to help them regain their sovereignty and freedom.229.	A direct and tragic consequence of the foreign military intervention in Afghanistan is the continuing exodus to neighbouring countries of millions of helpless men  women and children  who have been forced to flee from oppression at home and to seek shelter abroad. Nearly three million Afghans have sought refuge in Pakistan. This has placed an enormous burden on our limited resources  but we have willingly accepted it as our Islamic and humanitarian duty. We are grateful to international organizations and friendly Governments that are assisting us in this task. We do  however  look forward to the day when these Afghan refugees can return to their own country without fear of persecution and in conditions of safety and honour.230.	As a country directly affected by the crisis nearby  Pakistan has a vital interest in a peaceful solution of the Afghanistan problem. The essential elements of a peaceful settlement are: the immediate withdrawal of the foreign troops from Afghanistan; the preservation of the sovereignty  territorial integrity  political independence and non-aligned character of Afghanistan; the right of the Afghan people to determine their own form of government and to choose their economic  political and social system free from outside intervention  subversion  coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever; and the creation of necessary conditions to enable the Afghan refugees to return voluntarily to their homes in safety and honour. This is the framework that has received the overwhelming support of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations itself. It is within these parameters that Pakistan is engaged in sincere efforts to achieve a political settlement of the Afghanistan problem and is participating in the process of indirect negotiations through the intermediary of the personal representative of the Secretary- General231.	From the very beginning  we have participated in these negotiations with sincerity and a deep commitment to finding a peaceful political solution. We seek a comprehensive settlement based on the principles endorsed by the international community. Our primary purpose is to uphold these principles  not to apportion blame. During the last year  through an intensive negotiating process  substantial progress has been made in identifying the elements of such a comprehensive settlement and in elaborating the interrelationships among them. A number of crucial issues  particularly the time frame for withdrawal of foreign troops  remain to be solved  and we must hope that further negotiations in the coming months will result in satisfactory agreement on them. 232.	We fully endorse the Secretary-General's assessment that valuable and indispensable work has been accomplished during the past year. We must build on that. Pakistan  for its part  remains committed to the diplomatic process initiated with so much wisdom and statesmanship by the Secretary-General. I wish to assure him of our determination to pursue it in a positive and constructive spirit and to co-operate fully with the untiring efforts of his personal representative  Mr. Cordovez.233.	The conflict between Iran and Iraq  which has drained the precious human and material resources of those two States  remains a matter of deep concern and anxiety to the people of Pakistan. The war not only poses a serious threat to the stability of the entire region but could  in the long run  lead to outside involvement  the consequences of which would be grave and far-reaching. We have  therefore  spared no effort to facilitate an early cessation of hostilities and have participated in and extended full support to all initiatives  including those of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Non- Aligned Movement and the United Nations  to bring this tragic war to a speedy end.234.	In the same quest for peace and stability  we have been sincerely and steadfastly pursuing efforts to improve the climate of relations in the South Asian region and  in particular  between Pakistan and India. We are determined to work towards a future different from the past. With trust and confidence  we can gradually build an edifice of permanent peace based on mutual regard for sovereignty and independence and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Such a relationship  based on reciprocal restraint towards and recognition of each other's sensitivities  would be in consonance with the aspirations of our peoples  who seek peaceful relations and good-neighbourliness in order to enable them to devote their energies single-mindedly to resolving the monumental problems of poverty and ignorance. In the same spirit  we seek a just settlement of the problem of Jammu and Kashmir  which would remove the last hurdle in the way of full normalization of relations between the two countries.235.	In the context of South Asia  I am happy to report that the seven countries of the region have systematically embarked upon expanding regional co-operation  which is now institutionalized through the important decisions taken at the meetings of the foreign ministers of those countries at New Delhi last August. It is our hope that South Asian regional co-operation will flourish in an atmosphere of mutual confidence which can be generated only by a strict respect for one another's sovereignty and independence and non-interference in internal affairs.236.	The crises and conflicts in our region highlight the relevance of the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace and its quintessence  namely the peace and security of the entire region  in which the peoples of the region could devote their energies to building a life of freedom  dignity and progress. We recognize that the proposed conference on the Indian Ocean could become a landmark in our endeavours for the realization of the concept of the peace zone. We believe that the success of the conference can be ensured only through a solemn commitment of the countries of the region to mutual cooperation to resist threats against their security. Similarly  it would be a travesty of the concept if the regional States limited their concerns to outside Powers and remained unwilling to order their own relations on the basis of mutual respect and non-use of force. The issues of peace and security are at the heart of the peace zone concept  which  in the first instance  must be addressed by the regional States in an open-minded and flexible manner.237.	Effects of use of force and military interventions reach far beyond the areas of their occurrence. Accordingly  our concern for peace is not restricted to our vicinity or our region; we are opposed to the use of force  whether it be in Kampuchea  where outside intervention has prevented the people of that country from exercising their right to shape their own future  in the conflict over the South Atlantic  the threat of intervention in Central America or the circumstances of war and intervention in Chad.238.	In the case of Kampuchea  under the pretext of rectifying earlier violations of human rights in that country a regime has been imposed on the people of that country by force of foreign arms. The international community must not brook such violations. Attempts by powerful States to dominate smaller neighbours inevitably lead to conflict and aggravate international tensions. The General Assembly must call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea to enable its people to determine their own destiny.239.	From its very inception Pakistan has been in the forefront of anti-colonial struggles the world over and we are firmly committed to the elimination of the last vestiges of colonialism. We also condemn the abhorrent practice of	which is an affront to human dignity.240.	The international community must give unqualified and total support to the just struggle of the people of Namibia and Azania for self-determination and independence. South Africa  emboldened by a vast military machine which is augmented by the resources available to it from some countries of the West  remains adamant in its refusal to transfer power peacefully to the people of Namibia  and is demanding the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola as a pre-condition for the independence of Namibia. The General Assembly  the Non- Aligned Movement and  most recently  the International Conference in Support of the Struggle of the Namibian People for Independence have categorically rejected any linkage between the independence of Namibia and the presence of Cuban troops in Angola  which is a question that is entirely extraneous to this issue. We fully support this position. The contact group of Western countries bears a solemn responsibility for ensuring the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia.241.	Pakistan will continue to extend total support to the people of Namibia  led by their sole and authentic liberation movement  SWAPO  as well as to the frontline States which have suffered at the hands of South African aggression. The United Nations must take effective measures  including the imposition of military and economic sanctions  against Pretoria to ensure the early independence of Namibia and the attainment by the people of Azania of their inherent right to self-rule.242.	I must touch upon an issue which has a direct bearing on the survival of human civilization. The immense and pervasive threat to mankind posed by the lethal and awesome nuclear arsenals possessed by the nuclear-weapon States is all too evident. Over the years  the United Nations has accumulated an extensive and valuable body of thought and principles on issues relevant to disarmament  although its deliberations still fall short of offering a blueprint. An attempt to outline a comprehensive programme for disarmament at the second special session devoted to disarmament ended in failure  highlighting disagreements  despite the professed urgency attached to the adoption of such a programme.243.	Pakistan believes in an all-embracing approach to disarmament. For us  efforts at the global level  at the regional level and on the bilateral plane are all complementary and deserve to be advanced wherever circumstances permit. Similarly  we attach value to both long- term and interim measures. We have therefore support the general ideas of the concept of the freezing and prohibition of nuclear weapons  the strategic arms reduction talks between the United States and the Soviet Union  the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace  and security guarantees to non-nuclear-weapon States.244.	Two elements stand out in our perception of disarmament. First  we find an intrinsic correlation between progress towards disarmament and the international political situation. Goals of disarmament cannot be achieved in a political environment devoid of mutual confidence and vitiated by tensions and instances of breaches of peace. Secondly  no moral  ideological or political explanation is sufficiently convincing to justify the diversion of colossal human and global resources to improving and augmenting the formidable existing nuclear and conventional arsenals  which are already capable of destroying all life on Earth.245.	Disarmament  particularly in the field of nuclear weapons  has become an absolute and urgent necessity. The pressing task which confronts the international community is to seek the reversal of the arms race and ultimately to bring about the complete elimination of these instruments of global suicide. The nuclear Powers must be persuaded to desist from the production of these weapons and to channel the vast and invaluable resources so released towards the economic development and well- being of all mankind.246.	There is no choice between peace and war  cooperation and conflict  development and destruction. We must surmount our prejudices and fears. What has taken so long to build must not be allowed to perish in a moment of doubt.247.	I should like to take this opportunity to renew my country's pledge to the fundamental principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to reiterate our resolve to persist in our endeavours to promote amity  goodwill and friendship with all nations of the world."
"106",5520,"PER",38,1983,"ï»¿97.	 Mr. President  the delegation of Peru takes great pleasure in congratulating you most cordially on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the Assembly  an election which is a tribute to your personal qualities and merits and a just tribute to the sister Republic of Panama.98.	At the same time  I wish to express our gratitude to Mr. Imre Hollai  whose work at the last session was highly appreciated by the international community. I also wish to extend a warm welcome to the sister republic of Saint Christopher and Nevis on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations.99.	Lastly  I wish to convey to the Secretary-General our esteem for the work which he has done with such wisdom and dedication for the cause of peace  security and international co-operation for development.100.	I wish to make a brief personal digression to say that 20 years ago I was here in this same hall as the Minister for Foreign Affairs under President Fernando Belaunde  and I had then the same privilege of addressing the General Assembly. If I were asked what my impression after 20 years was  I would say that I was not so inclined to judge things by results  because the work of the United Nations for peace and international justice is permanent and long-lasting. I also see the value of the effort made by the international community to hold a dialogue and an exchange of views without obstacles or impediments in the Organization. This is a valuable contribution to peace  and that is why we have such faith in the United Nations. That is why we believe so much in its endeavours; it is not because of its resultsâI repeatâbut because these assemblies and meetings are a means to dialogue and a means of seeking solutions to difficult problems  motivated by a sincere desire to establish peace and justice in the international community.101.	I wish to begin my statement by reaffirming Peru's unswerving support for the principles of the Charter and its firm belief in the successful outcome of current efforts to make progress and to restore peace where it has been disturbed and to bring about justice where it has been thwarted. The continuity of our foreign policy in this direction and its contribution to the satisfaction of common yearnings are the best testimony of our loyalty to the Charter and our vocation to the service of the ideals of peace and security of the international community. In this respect  we believe that the principles of the legal equality of States  non-intervention and self-determination of peoples  and respect for treaties  are essential for the maintenance of international peace and security. Peru  as a peace-loving country which maintains and desires to maintain the best relations with neighbouring countries and with all countries  will remain faithful to these principles which are inviolate  and will not depart from them at any time or under any circumstances.102.	On the occasion of the celebration of the thirty- fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  my country reiterates its full support for the principles enshrined in that Declaration. Peru has approved and applies without any restriction all international instruments which call for respect for human rights and has incorporated them into its own constitutional texts  in order to make sure that they are fully implemented. For this purpose there exist special juridical instruments  procedural mechanisms for recourse and a tribunal for constitutional guarantees whose task is to restore the provisions of the Political Charter wherever they have been disregarded.103.	We are a democratic country and live in a state of law. The law guarantees the full independence of the branches of power and the periodic succession of Governments through free exercise of the suffrage to elect political authorities  members of the legislature and local government.104.	My country is adversely affected by the international economic crisis and by a succession of natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude. However  the determination of our population to work and to overcome these effects remains intact. The people desire to live in peace in order to redouble their efforts in the task of reconstruction and development. That is why they reject the outrages committed by a group of terrorists who are conspiring against these objectives and who  paradoxically  call themselves the ""Shining Path""  when in fact they should call themselves the ""Dark Path""  as they were very properly called by Adolfo P6rez Esquivel  winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.105.	The criminal activities of this group which have claimed victims among persons of the most modest social and economic strata  among men and women  old people and children  are concentrated in a zone in the hinterland of my country  representing 2.5 per cent of the national territory.106.	The Government  exercising its constitutional powers and seeking to protect endangered human lives  has been obliged to declare a state of emergency. The forces of order are acting resolutely to counter this threat and are bringing the captured culprits before the judiciary  which  as I have said  is fully independent. Unfortunately  there have been many casualties on both sides in these actions.107.	As a free and democratic country  Peru keeps its doors open to those who wish to come and verify these terrorist deeds for themselves and to draw their own conclusions. In this respect  we find it unacceptable that an organization such as Amnesty International should irresponsibly disseminate fanciful versions of the situation  whose inaccuracy has Been reliably demonstrated.108.	We believe that the greater the moral authority claimed by a body that says it is defending human rights  as the above-mentioned organization does  the greater is its obligation to verify the accuracy of its information  so as to avoid making incorrect statements which mislead public opinion to the detriment of the good reputation abroad of a Government which deserves respect because its conduct is in keeping with the Constitution and the law. The defence of human rights does not allow of a double standard. It is not right to remain silent about the crimes of terrorists while denouncing the custodians of public order for fulfilling their duties under the law when they take action against the terrorists for their crimes against civilization.109.	We nations which are the heirs to the legacy of Simon Bolivar celebrated this year the bicentenary of the birth of the Liberator. At the invitation of the President of Venezuela  the Presidents of the Bolivarian republics met at Caracas last July to reaffirm the principles of unity and solidarity bequeathed to our nations by the illustrious Venezuelan.110.	On that occasion  important instruments were signed within the Andean framework. The principal document provides new guidelines at a high political level for the sub regional integration programme  in the light of the experience of recent years. On that occasion  thePresidents declared their interest in the initiatives taken by the President of Peru  Mr. Fernando Belaunde for the creation of an Andean peso as a unit of account designed to facilitate transactions within the zone  for the establishment of the principle of free transit of persons within the Andean area  and for the linking up of the energy networks and waterways of the continent. The viability of that project was demonstrated by the recent journey of President Belaunde himself along the rivers which make up the Amazon and Orinoco river basins.111.	For some years now  countries have been making increasingly gloomy assessments of the international situation and increasingly pessimistic predictions about the future. Unfortunately  it must be recognized that there are reasons for this. It is not that the international community is being overwhelmed by alarmist and negative sentiments; it is that it has reached the objective conclusion that the conditions for international understanding are rapidly deteriorating or that efforts to improve them have for various reasons proved fruitless.112.	One important reason for this concern is the critical economic situation of the majority of countries  whose opportunities for development have been largely blocked by the burden of external indebtedness  by protectionist practices  by the shortage of credit on reasonable terms  by the decline in commodity prices  and by the unacceptable inequality of terms of trade. Such a state of affairs is unprecedented in an interdependent world which should be moving swiftly along the path towards international solidarity. Unfortunately the very opposite is happening.113.	Furthermore  there is a lack of will on the part of some States to conduct their foreign relations in a harmonious manner  with respect for the rules that have been established precisely in order to guarantee peaceful and orderly international coexistence.114.	This dangerous situation is a result of hegemonistic leanings and is promoted by the power politics being played with alarming frequency in various parts of the world.115.	It is all too commonplace to hear of violations of the fundamental principles of international coexistence that are explicitly set forth in the founding Charter of the Organization. Instead of conciliatory attitudes  we are met with positions of strength and acts of overt or covert intervention which violate the sovereign equality  independence and sovereignty of States. The principle of self-determination for peoples still under foreign domination is being threatened; responsibilities assumed in solemn commitments are being disregarded; the threat or use of force is resorted to and in some cases goes as far as aggression  invasion and military occupation; apartheid and other forms of racial discrimination continue to be practised; fundamental human rights are endlessly violated; the arms race continues; and  there is clearly a lack of determination to join in the effective co-operation which would make possible the justice and the new international economic order so loudly demanded by the majority of nations.116.	Very recently the fragility of the concept of international security was made clear by the shooting down of a Korean Air Lines aircraft. This was a tragedy for the Republic of Korea for other countries and for civil aviation that should never have happened and could have been avoided. Motives of security and national sovereignty  however worthy of respect  should never imply any risk to the lives of passengers or the safety of international air transport.117.	We must recognize that the situation I have been describing affects the survival of mankind  for nothing and no one can assure us that unresolved or exacerbated crises  or others which could come about in the future  as well as the increasingly immoderate power politics  and our growing inability to settle disputes in a speedy  peaceful and reasonable way  will not give rise to the great conflict from which there will be no return.118.	Thus it is clear that the fundamental theme of our times is international peace and security. But we must not only avoid and resolve situations which endanger international peace and security; we must also try  through collective action  to achieve the goals of the economic and social development to which all the peoples of the world are entitled. If we fail to make rapid progress in this area  peace is in danger. We must therefore shoulder our full responsibilities without delay and with a clear awareness that these responsibilities are not the same for all  even though they are inescapable if we want to guarantee the security of all  which is one of the fundamental purposes of the Organization.119.	My country  motivated by these convictions  aspires to contributing to the work of the Security Council  a task which requires a noble and firm commitment to the purposes of the Organization.120.	The Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization	is a document which by the wisdom and profundity of its analysis gives us much food for thought. We fully share his grave concern about the international political situation. We agree with his description of 1983 as a disappointing year in respect of the quest for peace  stability and justice. But we also agree with his view that the United Nations continues to be the best  if not the only  instrument at our disposal for the achievement of those ends. We hope that the Member States  particularly the great Powers with special prerogatives in the Security Council  will shoulder their responsibility at this stage of history and take fully into account the note of alarm sounded by the Secretary-General.121.	Peru shares responsibility for the historic trend that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has generated in international relations. We attended the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi  determined to take part in the search for effective solutions to the problems affecting the security of all countries and the development of the people of the third world.122.	That recent meeting represented a very important milestone in the movement's work. From a genuinely non-aligned and realistic position we made an analysis of the most pressing problems of mankind and appealed to all members of the international community for a joint search for solutions.123.	As a developing  non-aligned  peace-loving country  Peru reiterates its profound belief in the need to limit and control the arms race. This is the obligation of all countries  but some have a greater responsibility in this regard than others. We advocate a firm policy  in this regard  as a serious and sincere contribution to peace that will make it possible to allocate to the priority aims of development part of the colossal financial and technological resources now being devoted to unproductive purposes which pose a threat to the peace of the world.124.	It is for the medium and smaller Powers to act as spokesmen for the moral conscience of mankind  which demands nuclear disarmament and the prohibition of chemical  incendiary and other similar weapons. Similarly  the use of outer space should be reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind.125.	It is Peru's firm conviction that it is possible to find peaceful solutions that will eliminate the grave tensions in the Central American region. Indeed  we believe that this is essential. Such solutions must be based on a recognition of the economic and social problems that the inhabitants of the region confront  on respect for the sovereignty and independence of the States concerned  that is  non-intervention  on the self-determination of the peoples  and on the agreement and reconciliation of the parties  as advocated by the Contadora Group  which my country resolutely supports.126.	We are therefore very much opposed to turning Central America into a battlefield where alien ideologies can fight it out. We do not want to see the great Powers supplying the weapons and the countries of the area providing the dead in a dispute for which there is no rational justification.127.	Peru supports and will continue to support the legitimate claims of the brother Argentine Republic to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. The situation requires a prompt solution through negotiations  as urged by the international community.128.	As a country linked by many factors  and particularly by geographical factors  to the Antarctic region  Peru reiterates its legitimate interest in everything connected with the problems of that continent and its future use  and will strive to devote to the debate on the matter the attention that it deserves.129.	My country profoundly regrets the persistence of the grave situation in the Middle East. The delay in finding a solution to the problem of Palestine is the cause of the tensions and confrontations in the region. There-  fore  we believe that efforts to find a permanent and just settlement must take into account the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence. Similarly  it is indispensable to reaffirm the right of all States of the region to live in peace and security within internationally recognized frontiers.130.	We condemn the intervention in and military use of Lebanon  and call for the full independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country. We reiterate our support for respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus. We share the international community's rejection of the continued foreign military occupation of Kampuchea and Afghanistan  two non-aligned  developing countries. We are sure that the Korean question can be resolved by peaceful means by the parties directly concerned. We reject colonialism and all forms of neo-colonialism  and support the just cause of the independence of Namibia  within the framework of United Nations resolutions; we are convinced that the Secretary-General's recent efforts will promote the attainment of that noble objective. We condemn and reject the policy of apartheid  which we regard as an inhuman system which runs against the current of history. That view accords with the feelings of our people and article 88 of our Constitution.131.	There appear to be signs of an economic recovery in some developed countries as this year draws to a close. However  these indications of a possible recovery in one sector of the world economy and of a slowing down of inflationary trends have not yet had an impact on the developing countries.132.	It is therefore disturbing to note that policies are still being applied  mainly in the industrialized countries  which act against the recovery of world trade. This can be seen not only in the financial conditions imposed on countries deficient in resources  but also in the protectionist practices which impede the normal flow of trade. Excessive control of financial liquidity because of the expectation of pronounced fiscal imbalances in capital- exporting countries is keeping interest rates at very high levels. This jeopardizes the development efforts of countries with large foreign debts.133.	Commodity prices remain very low and there are market difficulties  in that external financing for development needs is hard to come by and terms are excessively onerous. In such conditions  how can the developing world overcome its problems? With what resources can it meet its external obligations? Effective forms of cooperation between creditor and debtor countries must be found  because there is a mutual interest in resolving this grave problem. If it is possible to find any positive aspect of the present crisis  it is that it has highlighted more than ever the interdependence of all nations  so that they are all seen to need and to complement one another.134.	Another aspect related to the foregoing is the need to ensure that norms applicable to operational policies of the international financial institutions will be revised on the basis of a consensus among Member countries  which duly takes into account criteria more in keeping with present-day realities. Without that meaning the abandonment of practices of discipline and sound financial and fiscal management  it is advisable that countries in need of funds have easier and more timely access to those sources of easy financing. That would enable them to deal adequately with their immediate problems and to embark upon medium- and long-term development policies with greater assurance. It is urgently necessary to update institutions as useful as those  which were created in earlier times in order to deal with other realities. There is an equally urgent need to provide them with the resources they need to carry out their functions fully.135.	The unification of negotiating criteria for the problem of external indebtedness is an advisable policy in the critical conditions in which the developing countries now find themselves. There are common denominators and individual experiences which should be exchanged for the mutual benefit of those concerned.136.	At the last session of the General Assembly my country raised the question of the need to reach agreement on a co-ordinating programme for the recovery of the world economy  for dealing with the immediate problems of the developing countries and facilitating the recovery of the world economy while directing it towards a sustained growth. The essence of that initiative was embodied in resolution 37/252  the implementation of which we look forward to in the near future.137.	The heads of State of the non-aligned countries  meeting at New Delhi  recognized that never before had the economic destiny of the developed and the developing countries been more closely linked and that the economic revival of the North is quite simply impossible without the survival of the South.138.	Since then the Summit of Industrialized Nations took place at Williamsburg  and we  the developing countries  hoped it would be the other watershed of dialogue and accord. There was also the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  whose results were not only discouraging in a world in crisis as ours is but also inexplicable  given the lack of understanding and political decision on the part of the industrialized nations.139.	Economic co-operation among developing countries  as embodied in the Caracas programme of action  is very important. In the present state of affairs  the strengthening of economic and political links among developing countries is imperative.140.	The meeting of the heads of State held on the initiative of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi  in her capacity as Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  has just been concluded. My country very strongly endorses the genuine principles which inspired the movement. The informal dialogue that was held with the heads of State and Government present at the meeting leads us to hope that a greater sensitivity towards and a clearer perception of the problems will make possible the adoption of immediate and concrete measures for the well justified and urgent demands of the developing countries and also the development of a common will to initiate global negotiations.141.	Peru  as a coastal State of the eastern Pacific  is convinced of the present and future importance of the Pacific basin  towards which new and visionary expectations on the part of mankind appear to turn. That region is showing economic and political dynamism by virtue of its abundant natural resources  the appearance of new industrial societies and the emergence of numerous States. That is a very large geographic  economic and political area for which we see a promising future. The Pacific Ocean should be a model of peace and co-operation from which nuclear testing and military confrontation would be excluded  and in which all forms of international co-operation and solidarity would be promoted. The area comprises new countries with great expectations. Peru attaches the greatest importance to the efforts being made to achieve a better knowledge of that basin and to identify areas of co-operation. We are establishing diplomatic relations with many countries of the region and are participating in various regional forums  because we believe that the centre of gravity of the world economy is tending to shift towards the Pacific basin. We must seek  from the very outset  to have peace  solidarity and justice implanted there as norms of conduct among the nations of that vast area  as well as in the rest of the world.142.	On behalf of the people and Government of Peru  I should not wish to fail to convey our gratitude for the sympathy and assistance received from the international community on the occasion of the recent natural disasters which devastated large regions of my country. I wish to emphasize the valuable initiative of the Secretary-General in convening a special conference to channel aid to the brother peoples of Bolivia and Ecuador  as well as Peru  in connection with those disasters.143.	We have sought to emphasize some of the principal problems engaging the attention of our Governments  and  therefore  of the Organization  problems which require just and prompt solutions in order to safeguard the international order now in danger  through sincere dialogue and expression of our desire for order and world peace. The persistence of some of those problems casts a shadow over our future  but that should not in any way weaken our faith and our determination to arrive at formulas to attain peace and security  which are the objectives of the international system and which it is the responsibility and duty of all of us to protect.

"107",5567,"PHL",38,1983,"ï»¿ 1.	It is a privilege to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. You bring to this high office impeccable qualifications  experience and wisdom. It is a tribute to Panama that one of its illustrious sons  a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and currently the Vice-President of its Government  now serves as President of the Assembly. Panama and the Philippines share a common historical heritage and strong ties of friendship. It is therefore with greater pleasure that we see you lead our deliberations.2.	At the same time  we extend our congratulations to the outgoing President. Working under the pressure of serious international events  he discharged his duty with admirable dispatch and objectivity.3.	We begin our deliberations under the shadow of a horrible disaster. The loss of the commercial airliner  KAL Flight 007  shot down under circumstances not satisfactorily explained  is a tragedy in human terms. What is undeniable is that the unarmed commercial plane was destroyed by missiles fired by Soviet military aircraft and that all its 269 innocent â I repeat  innocent passengers  of whom 24 were Filipinos  perished. My Government and people share the universal condemnation of and indignation over the loss of human lives  and we have formally asked for a full investigation to establish responsibility for the disaster. We have also asked for reparations to the families of the deceased.4.	The tragedy has another dimension. It could aggravate tensions between the super-Powers. It is therefore a matter of serious concern to the Assembly. To prevent its repetition we suggest that the Assembly begin the study of new and binding international agreements to ensure the safety of commercial aviation in circumstances similar to those which befell the Korean airliner.5.	This year has seen a sharp increase in the intensity and proliferation of conflict in the world. More than ever  the world Organization  through no intrinsic fault of its own  has been relegated to the sidelines in the very circumstances that it was created to moderate and resolve. This is not in keeping with the intent of the founders or in accordance with the will of the majority of the Members. It is brought about  rather  by the reluctance of a few States to acknowledge the will of the global community. It is  of course  these very conditions which led to the demise of the League of Nations.6.	We are only too aware of the highly volatile situation in the region of the world where my country is located  where foreign troops continue to occupy Kampuchea. The international community has repeatedly called for a comprehensive political solution to the Kampuchean problem which will provide for the withdrawal of ail foreign forces and ensure respect for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and neutral and non-aligned status of Kampuchea  as well as the right of the Kampuchean people to self-determination free from outside interference. My Government  in concert with other members of ASEAN  is firmly committed to the restoration of a stable and lasting peace in the region based on the real independence of the Kampuchean people. The countries members of ASEAN have therefore issued an appeal for Kampuchean independence which has been circulated to the members of the General Assembly	My country places considerablehope in the future of the coalition headed by Samdech Norodom Sihanouk as President. The international community has recognized this coalition as the legitimate representative Government of this sad and decimated country. A chain of events that will be positive for the peace  freedom and neutrality of South-East Asia can follow the restoration of Kampuchea to the Kampuchean people. We believe that the international community must renew and redouble its efforts to achieve that result.7.	In Afghanistan  the international community is similarly called upon to undertake fresh efforts to restore the legitimate right of the people of Afghanistan freely to determine their own destiny. The intensified activities of the foreign troops there suggest that they are in Afghanistan to stay. The Assembly cannot  on the basis of the principles which are its reason for being  accept this intolerable situation. The failure to make headway on the Afghanistan problem is all the more regrettable in view of the exemplary efforts of the special representative of the Secretary-General  our able Mr. Diego Cordovez  to promote a meeting of minds at the Geneva conference. In the middle of this year  progress was achieved only to founder on the rock of technicalities which have their real basis in lack of confidence and political will.8.	In another part of the world  the visit of the Secretary-General to Namibia and South Africa last month  under a mandate from the Security Council  defined the basic problems which impede agreement on the steps which could lead to the independence of Namibia. The question is whether South Africa genuinely wants a solution. In its view  Namibia is not the problem; the problem is Angola. Yet it is clear that the security problems of both South Africa and Angola are not necessarily resistant to solution. In the view of my Government  further progress on the question of Namibia can be achieved only when South Africa recognizes its larger responsibility for the peace of the whole of southern Africa  of which it is an integral part.9.	If there is an area of the world pre-eminently on the minds of all members of the world community  it is the Middle East  including the situation in Lebanon. We can recall many years  even decades  of relative harmony and peace in a prosperous Lebanon. One of the root causes of the turmoil which has destroyed the political balance in what had been a peaceful country is the unresolved problem of the future of the Palestinian people. Lebanon's invasion by Israel has now led to the direct involvement of major Powers in the area. The most immediate need  in our view  is for a cease-fire and the cessation of hostilities throughout Lebanon. We rejoice that such a cease-fire has been achieved and we join in the hope of the Secretary of State  Mr. Shultz  that the fact will force Syria and Israel to follow suit. The efforts of the United Nations to deploy  at a minimum  observer teams should continue to be supported  and the goal remains the withdrawal of all unauthorized non-Lebanese forces. At an appropriate time it would also be highly desirable to replace the remaining non-Lebanese forces with a United Nations peace-keeping presence  while the Government of Lebanon consolidates its role and the democratic political balance is restored. We were happy to read the statement of the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia today  when he said that an agreement had been reached for a cease-fire in Lebanon  ending the war and starting a national dialogue. What has been secured is a great achievement. We appeal to all our Lebanese brothers to go beyond the bloodshed and the hatred in order to resume the building of Lebanon.10.	The Middle East  however  will not cease to be a seed-bed of conflict until the right of the Palestinian people to self-determinationâincluding its right to establish an independent State in Palestineâand the rights of all States in the region  including Israel  to a secure existence within internationally recognized borders are assured.11.	If the Middle East remains a dangerous flash-point for global conflict and possibly for nuclear war  the accumulation of weapons designed for such a war also continues to accelerate.12.	Is there anything new to be said about the arms race? Each year we rehearse the frightful statistics  the wasteful sums spent on the arms race  both conventional and nuclear  which could have been better used for economic development.13.	The United States has something like 9 500 warheads in its strategic arsenal  while the USSR disposes of 7 700. Two or three hundred are generally regarded as sufficient to devastate either nation. The USSR has about 13 000 smaller nuclear explosives  each much larger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in the Second World War  while the United States has a tactical arsenal of about 20 000 smaller weapons.14.	The number of resolutions on disarmament adopted last year is a measure both of the concern felt in the international community and of the effort we have made year after year to elicit positive action from the two major protagonists. In the past 20 years the major Powers have not cared to complete a comprehensive test ban  a modest first step in slowing down the nuclear arms race. It is both unconscionable and unthinkable that not even this small step has been achieved.15.	The most needed step now is an immediate moratorium on the development and production of new strategic nuclear weapons systems.16.	I take some hope from the newer directions which are beginning to emerge in the Disarmament Commission and other bodies of the Organization. The concept of common security developed in the report of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues  parallels a concern which I have long expressed. I am convinced that a search for security is bound by its very emphasis to be more fruitful than a search for disarmament per e. As Chairman of the Group of Experts on the Relationship between Disarmament and International Security  I have pointed out that States have chosen to emphasize the pursuit of arms limitation and disarmament without examining how security is to be provided in the absence of national arms and armies.17.	The Secretary-General  in his report of a year ago  strongly stressed the ways in which the United Nations and its Members were failing to live up to their responsibilities  especially in the field of the maintenance of international peace and security. We fully shared his view then  as we do now. The world Organization is principally afflicted by the indifference of some of its significant Members.18.	With the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations a major effort was begun to enhance the capabilities of the United Nations in the light of the manifold changes which had taken place in the world since its founding. The major focus for this effort has solidified in the 47-nation Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. During the course of its existence the Special Committee has produced the most substantial study on ways to improve the United Nations that has so far been developed. Most of the members of the Committee have contributed their best efforts to this end.19.	At its previous session  the General Assembly adopted the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes  a major achievement of the Special Committee. Based on the urgency lent to the work of the Special Committee by the report of the Secretary-General  we were optimistic that further significant results would be forthcoming from that Committee. Unfortunately such has not been the case. The session of the Committee during this year has been a disappointing and disheartening one  despite the best efforts of its able Chairman  Mr. Nabil El-Araby of Egypt. We are gratified  of course  that discussion on a joint proposal by Romania and the Philippines on the establishment of a permanent United Nations commission for mediation  conciliation and good offices has begun  and we look forward to further elaboration of this proposal.20.	The world economy is in disarray. Despite signs of limited progress  large portions of the earth are in the deadly grip of poverty. Yet we accept the principle that interdependence is not an option but a fact. It involves mutuality of interests and commonly derived solutions. Where these new realities are resisted  a malfunction in the infrastructure of the world economy inevitably develops. Withheld participation leads to imbalance and inequities.21.	The thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly was extended until 19 September in a desperate effort to launch global negotiations on international economic co-operation. That it failed is symptomatic of the malaise characterizing this aspect of international relations.22.	The results of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development are a further sign of such malaise. That meeting  begun with bright promise when the developing countries  in their meetings at New Delhi and Buenos Aires  decided to approach the session of the Conference held at Belgrade with an expressed willingness to co-operate. The lack of significant results has left us with a bitter aftertaste.23.	We have no magic recipes for ending the impasse  but my Government will continue to contribute its modest share to every effort to overcome those problems. It was in this spirit that we proposed last year the inclusion in the agenda of an item entitled ""New international human order: moral aspects of development"". We believe that the establishment of a moral framework for economic co-operation provides an important key to the promotion of the inevitable just international economic co-operation. I hope that together we can elaborate a new international human order for economic co-operation.24.	We look with favor on the joint proposal submitted by the delegations of Malaysia and Antigua and Barbuda on consideration of the question of Antarctica. A study of this subject should enhance understanding of that largely unknown continent. We believe that the destiny of Antarctica is a matter of universal concern and should not be left in the hands of a few States only.25.	As I leave this rostrum  I wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  who has brought to his office a refreshing candor  as well as the courage of his convictions. He has provided us with lucid insights into the problems besetting the world. At the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly  he asked Member States to redouble their efforts to solve their differences  and at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  at New Delhi in March  he reminded us that the United Nations should be developed more as a forum for negotiations and agreements and less as a place of confrontation and debate. In his report to the current session  he outlines the various issues confronting the Assembly and calls for a recommitment to the Charter because  ""With an objective as elusive and as vital as the preservation of peace  a sense of shared purpose and direction is imperative.""26.	In conclusion  I should like to quote from a speech delivered by General Omar Bradley in 1957. General Bradley was of course an American and his words were addressed to his fellow Americans  but they retain  a generation later  perfect relevance to the problems of our time and address all citizens of the world. He said:""The central problem of our time ... is how to employ human intelligence for the salvation of mankind. It is a problem we have put upon ourselves.""If I am sometimes discouraged  it is not by the magnitude of the problem but by our colossal indifference to it. I am unable to understand why ... we do not make greater  more diligent and more imaginative use of reason and human intelligence in seeking an accord and compromise which will make it possible for mankind to control the atom and banish it as an instrument of war.""Unless we soon get started  it may be too late . . . Time is running against us  and it is running against us with the speed of Sputnik.""I leave you with this food for thought."
"108",5627,"PNG",38,1983,"ï»¿My delegation wishes to join previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.22.	We also wish to express our sincere appreciation of the able manner in which your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  guided the deliberations of the thirty-seventh session.23.	Like other speakers  my delegation also warmly welcomes the admission of the newly independent island State of Saint Christopher and Nevis. We look forward to cordial and close relations between our two countries both here and within the Commonwealth.24.	When I spoke in this Hall at the thirtieth session  a few weeks after Papua New Guinea gained independence  I outlined the approach we were going to take to international relations. That approach we called universalism: friendship for all except racist regimes.25.	Since then our policies have evolved and developed. We have built stronger links with a number of countriesâ those geographically close to us in the Pacific and Asia and our major economic partners. Our foreign policies have matured and are now presented under the general title of  purposeful direction . By this we mean that  without being strident or aggressive  we are pushing for progress towards international equity and order.26.	What do we intend by that? Very simply put  we believe that order can be achieved in relations between sovereign States and that an economically and socially equitable world-wide order can be organized. My Government is a strong supporter of the United Nations and other international organizations. We hope and believe that those organizations can bring about a new international arrangement of which equity and order are the paramount features.27.	We believe that neither equity nor order can last long in this world without each other. If we look around the world today we see examples of apparent order coupled with gross inequity and of people striving for equity amid gross disorder. For many people today equity and order must seem to be remote ideals. We in Papua New Guinea  while recognizing the barriers and difficulties  believe that both equity and order can be achievedâ indeed they both must be achieved.28.	I would first like to discuss the question of international order. To many people in southern Africa  Chad  Lebanon  Central America and Afghanistan  international order must seem an impossible ideal. They are suffering the effects of racism and international tensions which it seems this Organization can do little to moderate.29.	With regard to the arms race  world-wide spending on arms is estimated to be a staggering $800 billion a year. Considering this  none of us can safely be said to be immune from the dangers of war or the economic consequences of the arms race. I will discuss the economic consequences of this massive spending later. First I will discuss the implications for the Pacific and South-East Asia.30.	The South Pacific is not a region of intense great- Power rivalry. The possibility of armed conflict arising between military forces of countries in our region appears slight. But we in the Pacific are not immune to the effects of world tensions. Neither the South Pacific nor Southeast Asia is far enough away from the super-Powers to be free of the effects of the arms race. The members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [/1SE4N] have had first-hand and extremely painful recent experience of great Power rivalries and regional conflict. A generation ago we in the Pacific suffered similarly. We do not want to see it happen again. We believe that the vast expenditure on arms is not contributing to security: we believe it is contributing to insecurity. We believe the recent increases in arms spending and in international tension are closely related.31.	The present build-up can lead only to tragedy. The recent deplorable shooting down of the South Korean airliner and the tragic bombing in Burma are examples of what could happen. We believe that such incidents underline the need for international disarmament and a concerted effort to reduce international tensions. They also clearly indicate that organizations like the United Nations must act to provide safeguards for international travellers.32.	I come now to the subject of nuclear testing. Another aspect of arms development which greatly concerns Papua New Guinea is nuclear testing in the Pacific. We have for several years now protested in the strongest terms against the hazards to human health and the environment presented by the French Government's nuclear-weapon testing programmes on Mururoa Atoll. We have also opposed any plans to dump or store nuclear wastes in the sea. To give effect to these positions we have ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  supported the proposed extension of the Convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter  signed at London in 1972  to prohibit the dumping of all radioactive wastes  and consistently express  our outrage at the French Government's persistent and blatant disregard of regional opinion. Papua New Guinea has accepted an invitation to send a scientist to inspect the Mururoa facilities. This inspection does not imply any tacit acceptance of nuclear testing. Rather  it will promote greater scientific examination of the effects of the French programme. At the same time  we are studying the various attempts being made in all parts of the world to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.33.	We believe that racism  along with the arms race  is one of the most serious threats to peace and order in the world today. As I mentioned earlier  when I addressed the Assembly eight years ago as the leader of a newly independent nation  I stated that we would be friendly to all nations except racists. The policy of unceasing opposition to racism still applies. Racism andare by their very nature inconsistent with any concept of lasting international order. They offend the principles on which societies like mine are founded. Practitioners of racism and apartheid deserve not only condemnation but isolation. The opponents of racism deserve our strong  continual support.34.	Many small countries are the victims of racism and colonialism. As Prime Minister of a small country  I believe that I have a special obligation and interest in putting their case. Small countries have a right to be free from invasion or other forms of unwanted intervention from outside. The right to be free from foreign invasion or intervention is absolutely basic to any concept of lasting international order. I should like  therefore  to underline my Government's strong support for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea. For identical reasons  I should like to do the same in respect of the Soviet presence in Afghanistan.35.	The most tenacious and extensive form of international interference is colonialism. I grew up and entered public life in a dependency which consisted of a Trust Territory and a colony. That experience has given me a special feeling for the importance of the right to national self-determination and for the role that the United Nations can play in its realization. I should therefore like to lend my Government's strong support to calls that the right to self-determination be extended to the remaining colonial territories. I urge other Members of the United Nations to co-operate in seeing that this right is extended to all those still suffering under the yoke of colonialism.36.	One of the particular applications of this in the South Pacific that we are concerned with is in New Caledonia. One of our regional organizations is the South Pacific Forum  the members of which have accepted a variety of methods of decolonization. We believe that the continued denial of the right of colonial peoples to determine their own future is an affront to all thinking people. The French Government has announced some reforms. The South Pacific Forum has supported those measures  but we have also called for an act of self-determination which includes the option of independence and provides special safeguards for the Kanakas  a precise timetable for transition to independence and a visit by a mission representative of Forum members to observe developments. We are also considering the possibility of securing wider support for our position by placing New Caledonia again on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories.37.	The situation in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands is clearer  as are the responsibilities of the United Nations. There  my Government has been pleased to be a member of the visiting missions sent to observe the plebiscites on termination of the trust. We want to ensure that the rights of Micronesians are respected.38.	We believe that respect for the rights of other people  which  I would suggest  obviates all forms of colonialism  is integral to the creation of an equitable and ordered world system. It is basic to the kind of society we are trying to build in Papua New Guinea. We urge all Governments to respect human rights.39.	However  human rights  about which the Charter of the United Nations is so eloquent  do not exist in a vacuum. We need to be conscious  of their social context. We must be careful to ensure that a concern for human rights does not become a pretext for undue meddling in the affairs of others. While qualifying our stance in that fashion  I reiterate that Papua New Guinea condemns those who ignore  or offend against  human rights  and we add our voice to those calling for remedial action where needed.40.	We are also extremely concerned about the Middle East. That area continues to be among the most disordered regions in the world. Conflicts there could escalate into much wider and more perilous confrontation at any time. This situation disturbs us greatly  and I should like again to add my country's voice and vote in support of those who seek peaceful solutions.41.	As a sign of our concern  my Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade attended the preparatory meetings for the International Conference on the Question of Palestine. As Unsaid then  the Papua New Guinea Government  recognizes the rights of the Palestinians  including their right to participate in determining their political future . . . At the same time  we maintain our recognition of the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign State. 42.	We have been  and are  supporters of the Camp David accords. Recently we have been impressed by the increasingly active and constructive role being played by Governments and other protagonists in the region in exploring possible solutions. We lend our support to those who are working to bring equity and order to the Palestinian situation  to the calamitous conflicts in Lebanon and to the situation in the other countries in the region.43.	Until now I have been discussing issues related to international order. I should like now to turn to issues related to international equity. We believe that those concepts are inextricably intertwined: there cannot be long-term order without equity  and there cannot be equity without order.44.	The present international economic system is not equitable  and consequently international relations are not orderly. The present system features broad and growing differences in wealth; it is inherently unstable. We believe that meaningful steps to change this situation must be taken  and must be taken quickly.45.	My country has been hit hard by the current recession. The prices of the commodities on which village people depend for their incomes have fallen dramatically. Many of them are at their lowest real level since we began large-scale participation in the international economy. Government income has been seriously reduced. Plans for increased Government services have been suspended  public works budgets have been cut  and we have been forced to retrench part of our public services. Our long- term plan to achieve fiscal self-reliance has suffered a severe setback. We are grateful to the Australian Government for its increased support  but at the same time regret its necessity.46.	However  while grappling with the effects of this recession we must not lose sight of the fundamental weaknesses in the international economic system. The present system is inequitable  and there is a need for long- term structural adjustments.47.	We in the Pacific are a microcosm of the overall world situation. A villager from my countryâfrom even the most remote villageâis affected by international economic trends. Like most developing countries  Papua New Guinea has developed countries as its most important trading partners. Our most important sources of foreign investment  foreign aid and commercial loans are also in developed countries. Needless to say  these relationships are vital to us  but are of far less importance to the developed countries. Manufactured products are imported. So is a good deal of expensive Western expertise. Our exports consist mainly of a small range of largely unprocessed primary products.48.	We in the Pacific have taken several concrete steps towards reducing these inequities. We are seeking increased technical co-operation with ASEAN countries. A trade agreement with Australia and New Zealand gives products from Pacific countries preferential conditions. Our regional forum has established a fisheries agency to secure our common interests  and we have started a regional shipping line.49.	None the less  neither the trade agreements we have with Australia and New Zealand nor the Lome Convention have made much difference in the kinds of products exported from Papua New Guinea. South Pacific countries in general have an increasingly adverse balance of trade with developed countries. We believe that this trade imbalance is only a part of a wider and deeper imbalance in relations between the two sets of countries.50.	My country has called for regional co-operation towards a comprehensive restructuring of relations in the region  leading to a new Pacific order. We believe that in the Pacific as well as in the rest of the developing world  failure to restructure basic relationships will lead to economic stagnation and decline in developing countries. The primary changes we want to see are reduced tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade with developed countries and a transfer of skills and technology to developing countries.51.	The current recession has demonstrated yet again the interdependence of all national economies. My Government calls on all Members of the United Nations to work together interdependent  in an effort to right present inequalities.52.	As I mentioned earlier  we are concerned about the destabilizing effects of the arms race on international order. We are also concerned about its effects on equity. It poses a/threat to our vital communications and trade reunion the Pacific. It also  in the words of the secretariat of UNCTAD  imposes  strains ... on the flow of resources for development  and ... on the international economic system as a whole .38.	The majority of South Pacific countries do not have standing military forces. Those forces that do exist are small. Disarmament  therefore  is less of an issue for island Governments and peoples than is the prevention of armament. We are trying to bring basic services and development to our peoples. We wish to avoid the extraordinary costs and dangers of arms spending. As I said earlier  approximately $800 billion is spent annually on armaments. That spending  given the poverty of most of the people in the world  is obscene.39.	The law of the sea and the establishment of effective 200-mile economic zones are vital economic issues in the Pacific. As Prime Minister of a country with vast  untapped marine resources  I am committed to the establishment of an effective 200-mile economic zone. My Government is also strongly committed to the notion that the sea-bed beyond national economic zones is the common heritage of mankind. We are pleased at the progress being made by the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. I must  however  repeat my Government's criticism of those Governments which decline for reasons of narrow self-interest to accede to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.60.	The Common Fund for Commodities and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea must surely rank among the most outstanding contributions to potential international equity and order. I appeal to all Governments represented here to bring the Common Fund and the Convention fully into effect.61.	My Government believes that the present state of international economic and political relations is extremely unsatisfactory. We believe there is need for international equity and order. Today I have noted the trends that we consider dangerous and have outlined in very general terms the changes we believe are necessary.62.	Papua New Guinea is a small countryâin United Nations terms  a very small country. We are realistic about our influence in this Hall  but we have not allowed that realism to degenerate into cynical indifference. The people of Papua New Guinea have benefited from the attitudes and influence of the United Nations as well as from the work of its agencies. We believe that the United Nations has the ability to contribute effectively to the struggle for international equity and order. I call on the United Nations and all other international organizations to work for a more just and equitable world.  "
"109",5673,"POL",38,1983," Mr. President  permit me to welcome you  a representative of friendly Panama. Your long-standing service at the United Nations  commitment to peace and well-known personal qualities prove that the helm of the Assembly has been placed in good hands.I express my highest appreciation to the President of the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly  Mr. Imre Hollai. His success in discharging the duties of this office has been also a success for fraternal Hungary  a State of the socialist community  in concert with which we are striving tirelessly for the good of peace and the development of international co-operation.I convey the assurances of our highest esteem to the Secretary-General of the world Organization.I extend a cordial welcome to the delegation of the independent federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis  the 158th Member State of the Organization.On behalf of the Polish People's Republic  I come before the Assembly to address the major problems facing mankind as well as the United Nations  the most important and universal forum for their consideration. Yet  I must begin with the subject of Poland. I venture to do so not because I would accord a particular international significance to what has been happening in my country over the last few years. In point of fact  each and every country has its own internal problems that it should seek to solve on its own  if the right of every nation to sovereignty is indeed to have an overriding value. The point is that it is not we ourselves who have attempted to internationalize Polish affairs; it is those who had originally been most vocal in urging non-interference in developments in Poland and in pretending that Poles should solve their problems on their own who subsequently made an about-face in their position in an effort to force Poland to submit to their will. It can hardly be argued that that was the result of misunderstanding or insufficient information  since we patiently kept going all that was necessary to explain our actions.For months  in order to further good will and understanding  we kept the world informed of the introduction by Poland of temporary emergency measures that were indispensable to the defence of our statehood and constitutional principles against assaults upon them by enemies and the forces of anarchy and to steer Poland out of a profound crisis. The proclamation of martial law in Poland on 13 December 1981  in accordance with Poland's Constitution and the norms of international law  was as unwanted by us as it was necessary. In making that difficult choice  we were mindful that ""the Motherland is a great common duty"". The order to stand guard over it for the common good of each and every Pole has been issued by Polish history. It is also Polish history and no other that will ultimately judge our decision.Today no responsible politician can deny that Poland's desire for national salvation spared Europe grave tension.As we declared two months ago in a third and final notification in keeping with article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights   martial law  previously suspended  was lifted on 22 July last throughout the territory of Poland. We have kept our word. Emergency legislation did not remain in force one day longer than was absolutely necessary. Harsh measures have never been part of the Polish mentality. They are also alien to our political culture. An amnesty of wide scope has come into effect.Sustained by the inviolable and lasting principles of socialism  Poland is on the mend. We are strengthening what is good and noble  reforming what is inefficient and decrepit and eliminating what is bad. There can be no turning back from this course. It was charted by the programme of the Ninth Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party  and it reflects most fully the substance of socialist renewal. Its overriding idea is and always will be the construction of a socialist society in the spirit of our best traditions and in the interest of the Polish nation.Systematic internal normalization and stabilization are taking shape in Poland. They are being accompanied by an unswerving process of change and reform  reinforcing the principles of socialist democracy in all spheres of life. The Polish people is regaining its common ground of political expression in matters most vital for the nation. The dialogue between Poles continues. It is frank and open. Its fullest outlet is the Patriotic Movement for National Revival.A creative impetus is being given to the tradition of Polish parliamentarianism. In the period since August 1980 alone  the same has enacted almost 100 important laws  57 of them in 1982. The expansion of workers' and territorial self-government is promoting one of the basic tenets of socialist democracy: that of broad  popular participation in the running of the country.A constructive dialogue between the State and the Catholic Church and a number of other creeds  animated by a spirit of tolerance and respect for diverse philosophical outlooks  is progressing fruitfully. The recent visit of Pope John Paul II to Poland has demonstrated this forcefully enough.New  independent and self-governing trade unions  now active in over 90 per cent of places of work and gathering over 3.5 million members  have attained a membership rate considerably exceeding that in countries whose governments often like to accuse us of an allegedly slow growth in union ranks. Likewise  the number of national trade union federations is rising. 13. In difficult social and economic conditions  we are carrying out broad economic reform  the purpose of which is to enhance the effectiveness of the entire national economy. We are basing it on enterprise autonomy  active  legally guaranteed workers' participation and development of all-round co-operation with other countries. The road ahead of us is arduous  but developments are proving the Tightness of our endeavours.No nation is so vulnerable as when it is undertaking the task of reform. This fact is also well known to the adversaries of socialism. For three years now  our country has been the target of interference and brutal pressure by the forces of anti-communism. Since December 1981 in particular  they have employed against Poland every form of interference in its internal affairs other than military. They have thrown overboard the relevant principles of the Charter of the United Nations  the provisions of numerous General Assembly declarations and the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  signed at Helsinki in 1975.Threats  the imposition of conditions and economic restrictions  efforts to destabilize the country  propaganda aggression  the pressuring of Governments of various countries into joining m an unworthy campaign to penalize Poland simply for having exercised its sovereignty and rejecting the prospect of becoming the flashpoint of military confrontation  ""political colour-blindness"" and an obsession to see only blackness in Poland's situationâ these are a cross-section of the actions conceived against Poland. At the same time  we are offered prescriptions and remedies which their authors would never think of taking in their own countries.The long historical tradition of Polish-American relations set at naught  the leading role in this anti-Polish crusade has been assumed by the United States. Never in the history of our relations has United States policy been so directly aimed against Poland as in past months. It takes the form of so-called economic sanctions for sins uncommitted. They were allegedly aimed against the Polish Government  but consequently they have severely affected the living conditions of the Poles. In short  they are lowering the standards of living of the Polish people and hurting Western creditors. They are  first and foremost  a serious violation of the principles of international relations.Though we re ready to co-operate  open to the world and true to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  we emphatically repeat: there cannot and will not be a Poland as sought by the present policies of the most aggressive quarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As stated by Wojciech Jaruzelski  the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party  the leading political force of my country  we have our own ideal of Poland: ""an independent socialist State  within secure frontiers on the European continent  free of armed conflictsâthis is the essence of that ideal. This is the nub of Poland.We are not alone. We have alliesâthe fraternal socialist States. In difficult years their support  especially the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union  is of inestimable value. However  a secure and strong Poland  internally stabilized and united  is in the interest of peace and co-operation in the whole of Europe and the world. We are confident that this fact will also come home to Western politicians. When it does  we will not be found wanting in good will also to develop peaceful and equitable relations with those who at present refuse to co-operate.The stand of the socialist States  consistently maintained  is that in the competition with capitalism peaceful means only should be employed. In the 1970s it was hoped that the capitalist States would pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence. We remember  too  the words spoken less than six years ago on Polish soil by a President of the United States: ""I know in more vivid terms than before that nations like your own and the Soviet Union  which have suffered so deeply  will never commence a war."" Departing  unfortunately  from the principles of coexistence  the NATO States have embraced a disloyal policy of violation of the ground rules of peace.While a message of peace and offers of constructive co-operation for the good of humanity can be heard from the capitals of the socialist States  the talk in NATO capitals is all about how these overtures can most effectively be countered. From Prague and Moscow there has come this year another catalogue of proposals by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. The implementation of those proposals in good faith  without prejudice to either side  would free the world from the ominous arms race and the spectre of war. From Williamsburg and Paris we have heard chiefly of new armaments and the intensification of the anti-communist crusade.A war mentality of stirring up tension and intolerance is invading the world and directly affecting the quality of the international atmosphere. In the face of the escalation of the strategic concepts and doctrines  the development of new methods of killing  the destabilization of international relations and the pursuit of military superiority  the prospect of annihilation has already assumed a cosmic dimension. The Second Disarmament Decade is actually being turned into an armaments decade by the forces of imperialism. A severe judgment on these moves will be pronounced by the international community  for to refuse to renounce the first use of nuclear weapons is to envisage the possibility of being the first to use them. To call for armaments is to call for war; to battle in the present state of advancement of military technology and saturation of the globe with lethal weaponry is to gamble with the fate of hundreds of millions of human beings.The world expects the present session of the General Assembly to provide a stimulus for the improvement of the political climate  especially in East-West relations. We are therefore profoundly concerned over the exploitation by the United States and some of its allies of the incident involving the South Korean aircraft  tragic enough in its human dimension  to complicate and poison further the international atmosphere. Likewise  we categorically reject another manifestation of cold-war hysteria in the form of an unprecedented act breaching the freedom of access to the United Nations Headquarters in New York.The Charter reminds us that war ""twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind"". Twice the fuse was laid in Europe.The fortieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War and the great victory over nazism  fascism and militarism and the consequent establishment of the United Nations is less than two years away. We fervently wish to see that anniversary fittingly commemorated. It should really inaugurate a year of peace in the world. Today  however  a sense of responsibility for the future of our continent and for international peace  and the sufferings  casualties and heroism of the Polish people in both world wars bid us sound a note of warning that the planned deployment in Western Europe of the newest American medium-range nuclear-weapon systems threatens world peace and jeopardizes European civilization. Europe's survival cannot depend on overseas military and political command centres.The deployment of medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe would also threaten the security of Poland and the most vital interests of our people and State. Their installation would still further bolster the baleful revisionist tendencies in the Federal Republic of Germany and encourage the hopes of altering the historically established structures of European peace  founded on the inviolable and inseparable agreements of Yalta and Potsdam. The installation of medium-range missiles  NATO's singular contribution to the forthcoming Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  is a breach of the spirit of Madrid. Even at this very late stage there is still time to avert the danger and forestall the pernicious consequences of the plans of the NATO States.The statement of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  Yuri Andropov  published on 28 September 1983 is a weighty contribution to the debate on the fate of mankind. Its analysis of the problems of the world  which are aggravated by imperialist threats  is one that we fully share. Stemming from the unequivocal and consistently peaceful policy of the Soviet Union  this statement has pointed the way towards fair negotiations aimed at genuine disarmament  the strengthening of peace and improvement of the international atmosphere.A long sequence of events and unhealthy trends intervened between the commencement three years ago and the successful conclusion this September of the Madrid follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The success of the Madrid meeting is a ray of light in the still dark international firmament. The immediate future will show to what extent  if any  it heralds a return of better times. Naturally  any improvement in the climate in Europe could not fail to have a beneficial impact on the rest of the world. Indeed  the quality of East-West relations is diffused to all regions.People's Poland has never shut itself within the boundaries of Europe. We pursue an outward-looking policy. No record of colonial oppression sullies our name. We admire the struggle of the nations to strengthen their independence  to resist the pressure of neo-colonialism and attempts at destabilization and to eradicate socio-economic backwardness. It pleases us to find a position similar to our own being taken on the fundamental issues of our day by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which at its Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government at New Delhi last spring adopted very important documents relating to peace  disarmament and. We remember and appreciate that in what were difficult moments for Poland the majority of the non-aligned  developing and neutral countries displayed understanding of our position.Despite the unsatisfactory international situation  and in defiance of the activities of opponents of peaceful co-operation between nations and of instigators of tension  our aim remains a programme of positive action  hand in hand with all those who want the same. We have the perseverance and the good will to carry us along that road.Guided by this approach we supported the initiative of the Prime Minister of India  Mrs. Indira Gandhi  concerning a meeting of heads of State or Government during the present session of the General Assembly. The discussion demonstrated that even in such a tense international situation a possibility exists of dialogue and a common search for solutions to the most complicated contemporary problems.This is our realistic vision: to do the utmost to avert the danger of war and prevent the possibility of an outbreak of world conflict  especially nuclear. Our realistic vision is coexistence  not confrontation  containment of the arms race and the immediate achievement of effective disarmament; it is dialogue for the sake of supreme objectives.This goal is served by numerous proposals of the socialist States  including those contained in the Political Declaration of States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty  adopted at Prague on 5 January 1983; the communiquÃ© adopted at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty at Prague on 7 April 1983; and the joint statement adopted at the meeting of the leaders of the seven European socialist States in Moscow on 28 June. Their implementation would advance the vital interests of the whole international community.A new  momentous initiative has recently been put forward by the Soviet Union concerning the conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the use of force in outer space and from space against the earth. Poland gives the initiative its full support  as its implementation would offer mankind important benefits commensurate with the requirements of our times.The international community has never had available such widely developed machinery for disarmament negotiations on a regional and global scale  yet the results are in inverse proportion to the needs and possibilities. This makes it unmistakably clear that the problem lies not in the machinery but in the need to overcome an obsession with military superiority and with the pursuit of illusory security through acceleration of the spiral of armaments and destabilization of the strategic balance. Turning-points along this road would be: first  an immediate freeze on nuclear arms; secondly  a commitment by all nuclear-weapon States not to be the first to use nuclear weapons; thirdly  immediate agreement not to increase military expenditures and on concrete measures for their subsequent reduction; and fourthly  conclusion of a treaty on the mutual non-use of military force and the maintenance of peaceful relations between States parties to the Warsaw Treaty and States members of NATOâa treaty open to all other signatories.We believe that a creative impulse for such steps should come from the Soviet-American talks on the limitation and reduction of medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe and on the limitation and reduction of strategic weapons. The continued absence of concrete results from these talks is negatively affecting other spheres of disarmament negotiations. In progress in these talks lies the key to liberating the world from the spectre of fear and uncertainty of survival  and to breathing new life into the deadlocked work of the Committee on Disarmament and the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe. Such progress would open up new prospects for the reduction of conventional weapons and create an encouraging climate for the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  due to begin next January at Stockholm  to which we attach renewed hopes. This is our realistic vision: the elimination of international conflicts and tensions and the remnants of colonialism  neo-colonialism and racism.Still outstanding  however  is the question of how this is to be achieved when in various parts of the world pockets of military tension and crisis situations are growing more complicated or new ones are emerging; when the danger of their spreading is increasing; when undeclared wars are waged against independent States; when military presence is imposed on nations contrary to their interests; when in Latin America  Africa and the Middle east the force of political argument is being replaced by the argument of force  by a ""gunboat diplomacy"" dusted off from the lumber room of history. The source of such practices lies in the nature of imperialism.The bloodiest harvest is being reaped in the Middle East from the imperialist axiom of ""divide and rule"". A new token act is the separatist agreement on Lebanon which has merely given Israel the reassurance to continue its contemptuous attitude towards United Nations resolutions and placed Lebanon's territory at the disposal of forces hostile to the Arab cause. Before the eyes of the whole world a crime is being perpetrated against the Palestinian people. They can be assured peace and their own statehood only by a comprehensive settlement accommodating the rights of all participants in the settlement.On the periphery of that region  the Iran-Iraq conflict still continues  bringing suffering and sacrifice to the peoples on both sides.The arrogance of the South African regime and the political manoeuvres of certain NATO States are being allowed to postpone proclamation of the independence of Namibia  which should have become a sovereign State of free and independent Africa years ago.We are witnessing the intensification of unprecedented pressures on certain Central American States  violation of their sovereign rights and attempts at brutalWe express our complete solidarity with the heroic peoples of Cuba and Nicaragua.Interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Kampuchea must be stopped by recognition of  among other things  its rightful place in the United Nations. We also remain unswerving in our support for the important initiatives of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan for a settlement of the situation in Southwest Asia and for the constructive proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the Korean problem.Our realistic vision is also of a world recovering from the present economic crisis and of the whole international system of economic and financial co-operation restructured on a sound basis.Poland shares the view of the majority of the participants in the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade  and of the delegations gathered in this Hall that the basic cause of the deadlock in creating a new and just international economic order is the unwillingness of the highly industrialized States of the West to reach a substantive compromise. Determination to preserve the present structure of economic and financial co-operation springs also from these States' desire to retain a privileged position in international trade. The difficulties of many countries are compounded by exorbitant rates of interest on credit. Like the developing countries  we cannot accept such a situation. Nor do we agree with the deceptive argument that economic recovery in the most advanced capitalist States will automatically remedy the world economic situation. To claim this is to temporize and to divert attention from the crux of the problem.Development of equitable economic relations also involves the elimination of unjustifiable economic restrictions and so-called sanctions as a means of exacting political concessions. The time has come for the General Assembly to act in the spirit of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and to oppose practices of this kind. Our Polish contribution to the setting up of a just economic order is contained in the initiative to work out and implement economic confidence-building measures. We note that this is meeting with growing interest. If followed through  after the necessary preparations and consultations  it could be an important step towards freeing international economic relations from fluctuations and political expediency. We are working actively in this direction.The United Nations can and must play an outstanding role in putting the affairs of our globe in order. So we acknowledge the initiatives of the Secretary-General aimed at strengthening the Organization's effectiveness by applying the tried and tested principles of the Charter. We share many of the pertinent views and conclusions contained in his report on the work of the Organization including in particular the view that the key to progress is the political will of the Members of the Organization and their readiness to seek compromises. It is in this spirit that Poland acts in the United Nations. We support the constructive efforts of the Secretary- General also from our position as a member of the Security Council. We shall continue our contribution to the development of his idea for strengthening the Organization's role and effectiveness. We shall further develop our relations and co-operation with him  based on mutual respect and the inviolability of the principles of the Charter and the rules of international law.I wish to assure you  Mr. President and all the delegations present that Poland will work unstintingly for the expansion of platforms of understanding and cooperation in all questions of the contemporary world. "
"110",5744,"PRT",38,1983,"ï»¿ I should like to begin by congratulating the President  the representative of a country of the Group of Latin American States  with which we have traditional ties of friendship  on his election. I wish also to present my compliments to the former President and to welcome the admission of a new Member State  the republic of Saint Christopher and Nevis. It is with a sense of responsibility and deep concern that once again I see the Assembly starting its work at a time when in several parts of the world there are more situations of violence and tension  brought about in clear disregard of the norms and principles established in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Such disregard leads to a general climate of suspicion which makes it more difficult to achieve understanding among the peoples of the world. Despite the fact that Europe is not exempt from periods of greater or lesser tension  we must recognize that  in the midst of a world afflicted by hotbeds of tension and violence  Europe is the one place where efforts to find peaceful solutions have been relatively lasting and fruitful and where there is a climate of confidence and co-operation among the peoples. The just-concluded Madrid meeting on security and co-operation in Europe  held as the follow-up to the Helsinki Conference  deserves mention  not only because of the work actually accomplished and the indications that the way has been opened to the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act/ but also because it will make possible more serious and sincere co-operation and understanding. Two aspects of paramount political importance must be stressed in particular. At the Madrid meeting  33 European countries as well as the United States and Canada confirmed the agreements reached in the 1975 Helsinki Final Act. The meeting was also able to strengthen and broaden the determination and the spirit of the Helsinki document  to evaluate the present situation and lay down ways of improving it by establishing principles and formulating rules intended to regulate various national policies so as to make possible unrestricted practical co-operation among participating countries and to ensure within those countries the exercise by their respective citizens of their political and civil rights. Furthermore  and of no less importance  the meeting proved that dialogue is possible between States with differing political and social structures so long as the political will and mutual credibility exist. Within the context of the dialogue established and the political will shown  I should like to emphasize the decision to organize at Stockholm the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. That conference will take place soon and will be a step towards mutual trust and disarmament in Europe. Arms control is a decisive factorâon both the regional and the world levelâin the attainment of the climate of security and trust essential for the development of stable and fruitful international relations and thus for the cultural  social and economic progress of peoples. As we approach the end of 1983  arms control takes on special relevance in terms of the security of Europe and the development of closer East-West relations. We are thinking of the need for a minimal balance in the European theatre. The nuclear escalation is a cause of special and profound concern. We believe that nuclear weapons can and must be dispensed with  but on the basis of equitable agreements which would maintain an adequate balance of power at the regional and world levels  and not on the basis of unilateral options. Decreased dependence on nuclear force is imperative for the existence of a constructive peace policy. Recent developments in the strategic arms reduction talks and in the Vienna negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions lead us to believe that the possibility of achieving significant results remains open. If these two processes and the negotiations on intermediate- range nuclear forces are not obstructed  the prospects for the success of the Stockholm Conference  arranged in the context of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  will certainly be increased. Portugal affirms the need to arrive at an acceptable compromise at Geneva which will result in military balance and the reduction of arms and armed forces to the lowest possible levels  while guaranteeing the objectives of peace and security in Europe. The recent inexplicable destruction of an airborne Korean aircraft  which resulted in the death of 269 innocent people  did not help to persuade the world public of the existence of goodwill or inclination to engage in dialogue. In perpetrating that act the Soviet Union committed a crime against humanity without precedent in the history of commercial civil aviation and jeopardized the cause of detente. It is therefore urgently necessary that it give a satisfactory explanation to the international community. Portugal will endorse all measures leading to the strengthening of commercial aviation security and to the introduction into the Chicago Convention s of norms which will prevent military aircraft from attacking civilian airplanes carrying defenseless passengers. The vitally necessary reactivation of the principle of collective action by full use of the mechanisms provided for in the Charter of the United Nations presupposes the contribution of all Member States to the search for compromises and solutions which will eliminate the various hotbeds of tension. It was precisely the desire to participate in international efforts likely to give the United Nations the active role it should have in the preservation of international peace and security that led Portugal to attend this year's International Conference on the Question of Palestine and the International Conference in Support of the Struggle of the Namibian People for Independence. In both cases my country's presence reflected its commitment to co-operate in the clarification of possible means of negotiation which could contribute to the achievement of one of the main purposes of this Organization. My country advocates the accession of Namibia to independence on a just and realistic basis. Portugal has on many occasions expressed its unequivocal opposition to all acts which could slow down the process intended to assure the Namibian people that it will be able to determine its own future in a sovereign and free manner. Therefore  we cannot but feel apprehensive at the delays in the practical implementation of the plan set out in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  to promote the rapid implementation of which the Council unanimously adopted its resolution 532 (1983) of 31 May 1983. The delay in carrying out the political decisions which resulted from a previously achieved international consensus intensifies the danger of the outbreak of new confrontations  with unforeseeable consequences for international stability. The Namibian people and the countries of the area cannot go on paying the price  in human lives and in the resources necessary for their development  of the perpetuation of situations which are a clear violation of the most fundamental human rights. The Portuguese Government and Portuguese public opinion are particularly sensitive to the suffering resulting from the repeated acts of aggression and from the illegal occupation of a part of the territory of Angola and Mozambique  countries with which we have the deepest sympathy in their efforts to resist any policy of repression and intimidation. Respect for the national identity and for the right to development of those countries  which are so deeply threatened by the situation prevailing in the area  is a priority objective of the co-operation which Portugal has offered them  an offer which extends also to the other States of the area. Such co-operation covers all areas  bilateral and multilateralâin the latter case  with particular relevance to the objectives set out at the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference. Our initiatives are not aimed against any country; they are in the interest of peace and development in the area. The centuries-old relations of my country with the African continent justify the attention which we devote to its political  social and economic development. It was particularly gratifying for us to follow the recent efforts of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Addis Ababa in June  the results of which reaffirmed the traditional African ability to seek solutions to common problems through collective dialogue. The proposed agreement on the Western Sahara problem is most encouraging for the attainment of peace in other areas of the continent where the use of force jeopardizes the viability of the peaceful co-operation essential to the advancement of African peoples. Therefore we hope that the same spirit of conciliation and solidarity will prevail in the present conflict in Chad  bringing about African solutions for African problems. The Palestinian problem is at the core of the Middle East crisis  and its solution is a pre-condition in the search for a global  just and comprehensive solution that will guarantee the right of all peoples in the region to live in peace within universally recognized and respected boundaries. It is urgently necessary that the situation created for the Palestinian people be brought to an end and that they be guaranteed the effective exercise of their right to self-determination. My Government has tried to encourage all formulas that might lead to understanding and conciliation and open up prospects which will make it possible to break the vicious circle of violence and overcome the psychological barriers of mistrust and intransigence. It is in this context that the participation of Portugal in the recent International Conference on the Question of Palestine must be considered. In our opinion  the results of the Conference represent another significant step towards a global solution of the problem that will  within the United Nations and in the context of the international legitimacy frequently recognized by the international community  make possible a basic understanding that will lead to serious and concrete negotiations among all parties involved in the conflict  with due respect for the security of all countries of the area. The condemnation of the use of force  so often used in this area  entails Israel's withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the breaking up of settlements established in those territories  as well as the departure from Lebanese soil of the foreign forces not entrusted with an international role. The international community of States has a duty to restore to Lebanon the legitimate and universal right to territorial integrity and to the free exercise of national sovereignty. Portugal will continue to support all diplomatic activities and efforts aimed at the full implementation of all pertinent resolutions of the Security Council  in the conviction that only peaceful and negotiated solutions of the problems afflicting the region can stop the present escalation of violence and avert the implicit danger to international security  namely  that resulting from a disproportionate involvement by the super-Powers. My Government has followed with concern the tensions created in Central America by the peculiarities of a political evolution determined by a large number of factors  in particular the extremely unfavorable social and economic conditions. The need to avoid in this part of the world also the extreme recourse to the threat or use of force makes the search for political solutions urgent. These will have to take into account the social and cultural realities of the Latin American peoples and their yearning for pluralist models of society and must also respect the principles of non-interference  the inviolability of the frontiers of the countries in the region  and the reduction of the accumulation of conventional weapons. Portugal therefore supports the efforts of the Contadora Group and all initiatives aimed at the establishment of a climate of mutual trust  dialogue and non-confrontation which will allow all interested parties to safeguard their legitimate interests by means of active negotiation. The elementary norms of international law enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  which ought to be respected by all Member States  continue to be infringed on in countries such as Afghanistan and Kampuchea  where the continued intervention of foreign military groups hinders the free exercise of the sovereign will of their respective peoples. The oppression unleashed in those countries to stifle their legitimate aspiration to freedom and national independence has provoked the flight of refugees to neighbouring countries  with dire consequences for their social and cultural balance and an ever-increasing risk of the armed conflict spreading. We sincerely hope that the signs already perceived of a political solution to these problems will find concrete expression  and we support the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to that end  not forgetting the positive participation of the neighbouring countries  especially those giving shelter to refugees  in their attempts to promote the cause of peace. The cause of peace has not yet found an echo in Iran and Iraq  which are still locked in armed conflict. I renew here my appeal to them to cease hostilities and search for a settlement of their differences by peaceful means. My country's firm devotion to the principle of the peaceful and negotiated resolution of conflicts using all the mechanisms provided for in the Charter of the United Nations led Portugal to be a sponsor last year of a resolution adopted by the Assembly requesting the Secretary- General's intervention in the question of East Timor. Portugal continues to believe that the framework outlined in resolution 37/30 of 23 November 1982 is suitable and therefore respects the Secretary-General's decision to defer to the next session of the General Assembly the effective fulfilment of the mandate he received to find a solution to the problem. The international community  whatever its interests  cannot suppress the right of a people to its cultural  social and political identity or violate decisions of the United Nations. The General Committee  when deferring the debate to the thirty- ninth session of the General Assembly and keeping the subject on its agenda  was offered no opposition  a fact which cannot but be considered as a clear reinforcement of the role of the United Nations in the treatment of the item and of the mandate of the Secretary-General  who has now substantially broadened his basis of legitimacy and his effective possibilities of actions. We hope that next year the Secretary-General will be able to take the appropriate action and that it will not meet with uncalled-for resistance by any Member State. Portugal will continue to have an open mind and will give its total support to the Secretary-General's actions. Recent news of the increase of military operations in East Timor and of the difficulties raised concerning the intervention of the International Red Cross justify a growing concern on the part of Portugal and of the world public. Indonesia  because of its past role in the process of decolonization and in the creation of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  should cease immediately all activities which are not in accordance with international law and should adopt a position consistent with the principle of self-determination enshrined in the Charter. Portugal  which undertook a vast task of decolonization  would wish  as administering Power and in co-operation with the Secretary-General  to see the process completed in relation to East Timor  for the greater prestige of the United Nations and the universal heritage of decolonization. The dramatic situation of a people whose right to existence is unequivocally threatened cannot be met with silence or with hypocrisy. The coherence of principles and not mechanism of powers must guide the conduct of Member States in judging this question. The thirty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is being celebrated this year  a fitting occasion on which to remember that the Organization is above all an institution at the service of mankind. Thirty-five years is a short period of time in terms of history  but the experience acquired with regard to the need to protect fundamental human rights is of the utmost importance. The passing of time has conclusively confirmed what the Universal Declaration already anticipated  that is  that such basic matters as the peace  security and prosperity of the world are strictly related to the recognition  protection and advancement of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In the field of human rights such a perspective lays on the Organization a dual responsibility: the definition of principles and the enunciation of a code of conduct on the one hand  and the supervision of their effective implementation on the other. With regard to human rights in particular  the law that we would wish to see become the rule must be universal. All States are called upon to play a role in the establishment of that law. The Government of Portugal has already shown in practice its deep commitment to the achievement of that goal  as Portugal has become a party to the main international instruments concerning human rights. The work of the United Nations in the creation of a code of conduct in the Held of human rights  while of the utmost importance  is not sufficient. We believe that there are still several gaps to be filled. I am thinking of the right to life  enshrined in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and of the possibility of elaborating in the framework of this Organization a second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights with a view to abolishing the death penalty. As a pioneer in this matter  Portugal has very actively supported this initiative and will continue to do so. The conference held this year in the context of the Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination is undoubtedly an event of great significance to the international community and deserves from us a twofold evaluation. On the one hand  our participation in the conference and our favorable vote on the documents indicate Portugal's support for its traditional conviction with regard to all international efforts to eliminate racism and racial discrimination  On the other hand  we regret that the introduction of elements extraneous to the goals initially agreed upon for the Decade made it impossible to take advantage of this opportunity to create a consensus of the international community on the abolition of apartheid. Even though we wish  in the name of values of co-existence historically acquired and defended  to see the apartheid system completely eradicated  we cannot support formulations in the Programme of Action adopted it the conference which do not aim primarily at favoring and stimulating the necessary changes in South African society. Divided  we shall not serve the elimination of racism or the abolition of racial discrimination. As for the preparatory activities for the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women  the international community has wisely taken the path of consensus. When speaking of international activities to eliminate discrimination based on sex  I cannot fail to mention the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women  which enshrines as international law the principle of equality between men and women. The Portuguese Government follows with the greatest interest the evolution of this important international instrument and expresses its satisfaction at seeing a Portuguese woman among the experts members of the committee which controls its implementation. The world economic situation and its political repercussions are also a cause of concern to my Government. The complex picture of the world economy reveals contradictory signals. There are signs of recovery in some industrialized economies  but unfortunately the main features of the world's worst economic crisis since the Second World War persist. The interdependency of the global economy has today become a clear reality  which is finally beginning to be recognized at the highest political level. The recession in the industrialized countries led to the stagnation of international trade and the reduction of the flow of capital to the developing countries. Those negative effects in turn caused the increase of unemployment and the worsening of the crisis in the? more developed economies. Whilst it spares no country  the recession has affected the least developed countries more dramatically. The global problems affecting us urgently demand a global approach and global solutions. From the outset Portugal has supported the holding of global negotiations which would allow comprehensive and integrated discussion of the various questions. We continue to support this project  and we hope that the results of the important meetings which took place this year  such as the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  at New Delhi  the Summit of Industrialized Nations at Williamsburg and the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development will be translated into concrete results  paving the way to a real improvement in the world economic situation. My Government believes in joint  concerted action aimed at restoring economic growth and full employment in a more just world economy and at revitalizing the North-South dialogue. It is necessary to create conditions for a healthy and lasting expansion based on awareness of mutual interest and interdependence. The harmonization of economic policies must be carried out so as to reconcile the efforts of each country and to ensure their real effectiveness in trying to achieve a revitalization of the global economy  promotion of employment  increased production  stabilization of the financial market  strengthening of the financial system in general  maintenance of open trade relations and the normalization and increase of the flow of capital and transfer of resources to support and improve the development process. My country  which is at an intermediate stage of economic and technological development  has striven for recognition of the existence of different real levels of development. Such recognition is essential and would be beneficial. Portugal is simultaneously donor and recipient of assistance essential to national development. We therefore understand not only the difficulties affecting the more developed economies  but the needs of the developing world. The problem of energy  which has extremely adverse consequences for my country's balance of payments  the need for investment and technology  the effect of certain protectionist measures and the difficulties of the international financial system constitute limitations to which Portugal is particularly sensitive and which hamper the implementation of measures necessary to our development process. Portugal's adherence to the European Communities is one of the first objectives of my Government's policy and is actively supported by the Portuguese people. But whilst it is true that political  economic and geographic ties closely bind my country to Europe and make our integration entirely valid  Portugal also believes that"" its presence and active participation in the European Communities will give a new dimension to its relations with countries and peoples from other continents to which we are no less bound by indestructible historic and cultural ties. I stress our relationship with Africa  which we consider especially importantâin particular  with the Portuguese-speaking African countries. The horizons opened up to us are vast  and we congratulate ourselves that the existing potential is being translated into solid reality. This co-operation has had a predominantly bilateral basis  but  given the economic dimensions of our country  we have also tried to resort to and increase the means of trilateral co-operation  not just with third donor countries but also with international institutions on the basis of previous agreements between the recipient countries and Portugal. Taking into consideration the fact that in an interdependent world information is a decisive factor in the economic  social  cultural  moral and spiritual development of societies and States  it is vital that the international community create conditions which permit an increasing free exchange of information and an improvement in the world system of communications without any hegemony leading to loss of character. The Portuguese Government understands  and cannot but support  the collective yearning  many times voiced in international forums  for a new world order of information and communication based on the development of a human and technical infrastructure favoring constructive dialogue and co-operation between Governments  regions  local communities and citizens. Portugal considers that freedom of opinion and freedom of expression constitute the basis of all democratic societies  inasmuch as they are the guarantors of respect for other fundamental rights of man. It is the duty of States to provide the institutional conditions which will permit freedom while respecting plurality of opinions. After being values and objectives which Portugal defends and  indeed  implements  my Government would like to have them shared by a larger number of States  since their affirmation  enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  is one of the fundamental duties of the Organization.  The persistence of situations of conflict  in violation of universally accepted international law  confers particular importance on the collective efforts at objective evaluation of hotbeds of tension in the present international scene. That is why I do not want to end this intervention without referring to the heavy responsibility resting on the United Nations; precisely because it is the most universal of all international organizations  and especially on its Secretary-General  whose report is once again proof of the distinguished and well-balanced way in which he has carried out his mandate. 233. The efforts made here we determine the real possibilities of co-operation among nations  co-operation which  given the increasing ties of interdependence  is ever more essential for international security and prosperity and for a corresponding climate of justice  peace and harmony between people. Let us be more loyal to the United Nations. Let us fight for the establishment of a world order of law  which is a permanent aspiration of all peoples of the earth. Let us make of this institution a real instrument of harmony  and not a systematic stage for confrontation. Let us be faithful to the Charter of the United Nations."
"111",5790,"PRY",38,1983,"ï»¿238.	Mr. President  my first words willbe to express  on behalf of the delegation of Paraguay  the great pleasure with which we learned of the election of the Vice President of the Republic of Panama  Mr. Jorge Illueca  to preside over this session of the Assembly  which is undoubtedly the most important world forum  the proceedings of which will be so positively marked by the intelligent leadership which we are entitled to expect from his distinguished talents.239.	The problems of the world are complex and a matter of concern  which makes the work of this forum a very difficult undertaking  if we are to keep the dialogue going and stimulate interest in solutions which will not only be just but will also strengthen confidence in the Organization and warrant the hopes and expectations of the peoples. The President has the most eminent and distinguished qualifications and comes from a noble background and we have every hope that his wise conduct of the proceedings will ensure the success of this thirty- eighth session.240.	Thirty-eight years have elapsed since the San Francisco Conference and the world has not yet rid itself of problems  nor could it have been expected to  because  given the human condition  that would be Utopian. Nevertheless  we have to recognize that a solid moral scaffolding has been erected and that violations  negative facts  regressive conduct and opposition to the norms for coexistence within the global community have not gone unnoticed. They give rise to reactions  arouse criticism and condemnation  or generate solidarity  depending on the situation. As a result  there has been a definition and a deepening of a universal conscience in the future of which we must believe in order to increase our efforts on its behalf and to prepare the advent of a more coherent future  better structured around the ideals of justice  liberty  equal opportunity for all nations and an open spirit so that together we can reduce material inequality within the framework of co-operation and integration.241.	One source of tension follows another  problems multiply and become more complicated  danger assures alarming proportions threatening to spark unforeseeable conflagrations. However  above this is the desire for peace and the determination not to slacken the efforts to reach agreements which can solve problems or conflicts with the least sacrifice. This favourable attitude towards peaceful understandings is confirmed even in a negative sense when these problems or conflicts drag on endlessly but are kept at controllable levels  awaiting an opportune moment to be rooted out. It is a reality worth studying because no situation can last indefinitely in this way  since the patience to hope and trust can be rewarded by cruel disappointment and frustration  which lead to desperate remedies.242.	In the 38 years of the Organization's existence there have been many local conflicts which have disturbed an era which  in global terms  may be defined as one of peace and development  in spite of discrepancies and contradictions which have not always been merely anecdotal or superficial. Therefore  we must recognize that it is necessary to do much more to overcome local and regional conflicts  and at the same time promote co-operation  so that by multiplying our efforts  development in peace will become an encouraging characteristic of countries and regions  particularly those which need to do so much more to raise themselves to a decent level within the world community. In this process  which should not be delayed âand this will not be the first time this has been saidâ industrialized countries  particularly the super-Powers  which together form a privileged minority in the world family of nations  bear particular responsibilities  ranging from creating a climate of tranquillity and confidence to assistance and co-operation  to make up for inadequacies and shortcomings and to allow the developing world  which embraces so many nations in different continents  to embark on its liberation from misery  ignorance  disease  the daily grind of subsistence living  its economic dependence on primary commodities  so that they can put into effect their plans for integrated modernization with greater ease and with more economic support.243.	With respect to Paraguay  we are not expressing ideas of frustration or dissatisfaction. Quite the contrary; in my country the process of economic and social development has been proceeding satisfactorily for several decades  so that if we must now face negative changes in the world situation  at least our country does not feel its paralyzing effects  because the momentum gained and the changes we have achieved have placed the country in a better position to face up to challenges. This is the essential merit of the Government of General Alfredo Stroessner  whose development policy has aroused the interest and participation of the citizenry  with the side effect of affirming peace and consolidating political stability. In this atmosphere governmental action and private initiative have worked in greater harmony and become more effective  leading to a better utilization of our limited resources. This reality  which is confirmed by facts and by the general atmosphere of the countryâ secure and confident  without ups and downsâis what has lent our situation credibility and attracted international co-operation  to which we attribute great importance. Indeed  we should very much like that co-operation to continue.244.	But basicallyâand this too must be recognizedâ there has been a will to act and a decision to begin. That has won the sympathy and respect of the organizations of co-operation and development financing  both at the world and at the regional level. Economic growth in Paraguay has been the highest in Latin America  achieving a rate of 5.81 per cent between 1980 and 1982  but it has now come up against the world economic crisis. However  if the necessary assistance is still forthcoming  and with additional support from the development of our own economy  the Republic of Paraguay hopes to measure up $o its task and stand the test without postponing its expectations of a new stage of modernization of its infrastructure  with an increase in cattle production  the initial achievements of industrial development  new prospects of regional integration in the Southern Cone and the availability of abundant electrical energy from the binational hydroelectric station at Itaipu  being built with Brazil  whose first generators will go into operation next year. We know that even with these certain factors things will not be easy  but we are talking about positive achievements of permanent value  and it is our conviction that circumstances will change for the better throughout the world  which will mean for my own country the opening up of yet another stage  in better conditions and with better prospects.245.	This capacity for peace  this dedication to development in a climate of political normalcy  free from the corrosive harassment of extremist violence and political and social disruption  make it possible for the Republic of Paraguay  to this body with full confidence to proclaim in this Organization and our certainty that v. Ah time  events and experiences will strengthen the peaceful instruments of its action  without which our illusive security would have been even more problematical; indeed it might have succumbed to the effects of some perfidious crisis.246.	As a world Organization  it is becoming increasingly representative of the whole world and the number of Member States is constantly growing. Now we welcome the admission of a newly independent State  which in this way has quite rightly won a seat among equals in the Organization and the Assembly. I am referring to Saint Christopher and Nevis  to which we extend our best and warmest wishes  for two reasons: because a star has now been added to the constellation of the United Nations and because at the same time the family of American nations has been extended and strengthened.247.	However  storm clouds are gathering and becoming ever more ominous. I am speaking about the arms race  which with modem technological advances can only give rise to very serious and well-justified fears. There is the possibilityâwhich is reason for some hope although it has not been explicitly corroboratedâthat the two super-Powers desire to limit their nuclear weapons. That  of course  would bring relief to the rest of the world. For this is the reality and this is the place to say it  in the midst of the General Assembly: the reign of atomic science and its mind-chilling projections in the sphere of war and destruction are exclusive to the two super-Powers. A very small number of industrialized nations do have a share in this  but beyond that limited circle  all the other nations and the seething mass of humanity inhabiting them do not have enough resources to ensure their own survival if there were the nuclear catastrophe that we so wish to avoid.248.	The arms race of some developing countries is equally senseless. Their programmes in this field do not seem to be inspired by purely defensive considerations. Conventional armamentsâbut armaments that are highly sophisticatedâare piling up in the arsenals of countries whose primary needs are obviously in other areas. Although we do not wish to belittle the security and sovereignty of nations  which deserve great respect and the closet attention  we cannot possibly disregard the fact that in speculating with these values and trying to reach for priorities that are out of step with reality  countries are sacrificing to the acquisition of weapons which they cannot use efficiently  or even keep in good condition  the elementary needs of their peoples: the elimination of poverty  which is the first step for the mobilization of the collective conscience in pursuit of economic and social development.249.	Whatever the level of armament  once it becomes the subject of an uncontrolled or frenzied or over- provocative arms race  it can only serveâas my delegation maintained on another occasionâto awaken suspicion  fear and sterile rivalry among nations. As was quite rightly said at that time  the mere accumulation of arms and competition between States for the acquisition of arms are already the beginning of war-mongering  which could lead us to painful experiences.250.	The Republic of Paraguay  whose history contains bloody proof of the effects of two international wars  has a people that  while it does not fear war  loves peace and is incapable of bearing sterile grudges. Its constitutional Government  headed by a far-sighted soldier-statesman  General Alfredo Stroessner  interpreting these essential elements of the Paraguayan national spirit  has laid stress  in his leadership  on development  on the physical integration of the territory  on agrarian reform  on increasing cattle production and on democratic participation by the people in determining the direction of the country's policy. He has done this in an awareness that this is the best bulwark for peace  the first element in the development of nationsâdevelopment being also understood as the strengthening of its international identity and the augmentation of its capabilities of winning international respect and consideration.251.	With a legitimate constitution  the fruit of the free deliberation of all the political parties in the 1967 national constituent assembly; with a republican  democratic and representative Government  which periodically goes to the people so that they can exercise their sovereign right regarding the make-up and the establishment of a Government with a plurality of options and votes; and with all the momentum gained from a stage of fruitful coexistence  the Republic of Paraguay has in recent years achieved unprecedented development  through an effort in which there has been a significant aggregation of the initiatives and actions of the Government  the direct participation of the people in the most varied forms of co-operation  and civic action by the armed forces in the work of establishing the infrastructure  such as bridges  roads  communications networks  in campaigns for health and literacy and the settling of peasant families in regions recently included in development plans or in previously empty lands. Integration of the Gran Chaco of Paraguay  in the implementation of its development programmes  in support for new settlements for the formation of stable populations and cattle-raising homesteads  the civic action of the armed forces is of vital importance. We would highlight the specific participation of the navy along the banks of the River Paraguay  of the army in the various activities of our vast interior  and of the air force in anticipation of roads and telephone and even telegraph facilities to deal with the liaison and communications requirements of the new development centers.252.	As permanent evidence of its position in the international community Paraguay included in its constitution of 1967 article 9  which provides that: The Republic recognizes the principles of international law; it condemns wars of aggression or of conquest and any form of colonialism or imperialism; it accepts the pacific settlement of international disputes by juridical means; and it proclaims its respect for human rights and the sovereignty of people. It hopes to live in peace with all nations and to maintain friendly cultural and trade relations with them on the basis of juridical equality  of non-intervention in internal affairs  and of the self-determination of peoples.  253.	In keeping with that position  my delegation would like to state that Paraguay supports all efforts to smooth the rough places and facilitate contacts so that parties in an international dispute can deal with it on a bilateral basis  if possible  since that is the most direct and effective way  or so that resort may be had to multilateral action  which can never be an obstacle to direct settlement but  on the contrary  may facilitate it  because of the presence of a friendly and conciliating influence.254.	In this sense it is only fair to emphasize the diligence  persistence and firmness with which the Secretariat  especially the Secretary-General  the illustrious Peruvian Mr. Javier P4rez de Cuellar  has promoted and stimulated all initiatives to bring the most difficult problems to the negotiating table and to recommend peaceful solutions through organs of the United Nations or with the good offices of a group of nations or through direct contacts with the object of narrowing differences. This is a task which is never easy and often seems impossible  but the Secretary-General has an indefatigable will in the interest of universal peace and concord. The delegation of my country wishes to express its gratitude for this and to urge the Secretary-General to continue placing his great talents and dedication at the service of the United Nations for the sake of a better and more just world.255.	However  no matter how much faith and optimism there may be in projecting against a calm background the overwhelming responsibility of the United Nations and the delicacy and complexity of its functions  it is necessary to highlight the insistence with which new problems present themselves  the persistence of others in spite of considerable efforts to solve them and the complications which can so easily cause conflicts  although limited in their origins and apparently easy to settle  to become very thorny and dangerous.25f. By way of illustration  to give evidence of the interest with which the Republic of Paraguay views the world's problems  my delegation would like to refer to certain questions which compelled it to take a stand in delicate  serious but always important circumstances.256.	I refer first to the question of the Malvinas  over which the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland waged  in the icy land of the archipelago bearing that name and in southern waters  a brief but bloody war. The question was broadly debated  first in the Security Council and then at the thirty-seventh session.257.	The Republic of Paraguay took part in the debate on the item in both organs of the United Nations. Nothing could better illustrate the position of my country than the statement made by Mr. Luis Gonzalez Arias at the thirty-seventh session: The long pacifist tradition of my country  as well as our feeling of solidarity with friendly nations  impelled my delegation to join those that requested the inclusion in the agenda of the item entitled 'Question of the Malvinas Islands'  as well as to co-sponsor draft resolution He continued  referring to Paraguay: As a founding Member of the United Nations  and respectful as we are of the principles and purposes set forth in the Charter  we feel the responsibility and the duty to participate in the debate on this item in order to contribute to the search for a peaceful solution . . . The basis for voting followed: As is well known  the United Nations began its consideration of this item in 1965  during the twentieth session of the General Assembly  for the purpose of resolving in a peaceful manner the sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas Islands between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom  as was convincingly reflected in the terms in which General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX) was drafted. The invocation in certain paragraphs of resolution 2065 (XX) of the principles contained in resolution 1514 (XV)  which is recognized to be the basic resolution on decolonization  clearly established that the principle of self-determination was not applicable in the dispute over the Malvinas Islands because those Islands are an occupied territory and thus the principle of territorial integrity is the overriding factor  although provisions must of course be made for protecting the interests of the British population inhabiting the Islands. The draft resolution before us today  submitted by 20 Latin American countries  contains almost the same arguments and terms that were used in resolution 2065 (XX). The draft resolution is an attempt to maintain the balance between the interests of both parties and to initiate negotiations under the good offices of the Secretary-General for the purpose of finding a peaceful solution to a difficult situation that has already existed for a century and a half. It does not seek to impose solutions contrary to the principles of the Charter  and it affords broad discretion for the negotiation of all relevant aspects of the question  as envisaged ever since the beginning of this initiative in 1965.  Examining the nature of the problem  my delegation  with regard to its own vote  went on to explain: There can be no doubt that we are dealing not with a problem of self-determination  but rather with a dispute of a territorial nature between two States  and as proof of that statement  we have the adoption by a very large majority of resolutions 3160 (XXVIII) and 31/49. The historic facts of the possession of the Malvinas are known to all  and I shall not go into a detailed analysis of them  although they are relevant in the overall context of the negotiations. This was pointed out by Mr. Gonzalez Arias in formulating this conclusion: There can be no attempt now to change the basis on which the negotiations have gone on from the beginning  nor can we agree that time can compensate for the initial inadequacies of one party's title. My country has never recognized the use of force or military occupation as a means of acquiring territory. Nor can the passage of time change the illegitimate nature of such an act. To accept such acts would be to perpetuate colonial situations  and in so doing we would be denying the true meaning of resolution 1514 (XV)  the scope and interpretation of which  I must repeat  have been fully clarified by United Nations practice  not only in the case of the Malvinas  but in other similar cases. We sincerely believe that the negotiations can yield positive solutions. We believe in the maturity of the two countries involved in this conflict. The bitter lesson of the military confrontation in the South Atlantic should serve to make it understood once and for all that the use of force cannot and with not lead to just or final solutions.  [72?Mf.  /wrap. g/M? 723.]258.	The Republic of Paraguay stands by the resolution for which it voted  which consisted of three points. First  it was requested that the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom resume negotiations in order to find as soon as possible a peaceful solution to the sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas Islands. Secondly  the Secretary-General was asked  on the basis of the resolution  to undertake a renewed mission of good offices to assist the parties to find the solution called for in paragraph 1 and to take the necessary measures to that end. Thirdly  the Secretary-General was asked to report to the General Assembly at its thirty-eighth session on the progress made in the implementation of the resolution.259.	I turn to the reunification of the two Koreas. By the very nature of this problem  which fundamentally affects the Korean nation  a single nation in the historic sense  it may be asserted that a successful  lasting solution can be found only through direct negotiations between the authorities of South Korea and North Korea  without outside interference. The Republic of Korea has taken this position officially and has repeatedly expressed its readiness for dialogue  so the solution should be sought through negotiations exclusively between Koreans. We regard as positive the response of the international community to this position  which has the merit of a conciliatory precedent for dialogue  but we must realize that the question has not been on the General Assembly's agenda for the past seven years. Whatever may have been the obstaclesâand here we see a lack of interest by one of the partiesâthe problem should be dealt with in a way that its importance merits  and a solution should continue to be sought.260.	From the human point of view we must bear in mind the sufferings of millions of Koreans who were separated from their families when the two Koreas were divided. It has been estimated that 10 million people are in this situation  which has not changed. The last initiative to alleviate the suffering of separated Korean families dates back a decade  to the conference of the Red Cross of South Korea and the Red Cross of North Korea. Begun in 1972  its proceedings were suspended in 1973  and since then there has been no progress towards putting an end to this distressing problem  whose major difficulty lies in the very fact of the division of Korea into two ideologically antagonistic States and the differences in their situation in the international community.261.	For the sake of peace and of human rights  which embrace the Korean nation over and above divisions  the delegation of Paraguay believes that we should encourage the Secretary-General's initiative in his noble mission of good offices to promote dialogue between the two Koreas. This task has its antecedents in his visit to North Korea on 2 and 3 May 1979 and to the Republic of Korea from 4 to 6 May.262.	Because of the persistence of the problem and the obstacles raised by other factors  a State with 40 million inhabitants and a volume of trade of $50 billion remains outside the United Nations  despite participating as a full member in 55 international organizations  including 14 specialized agencies of the world Organization. This situation  which is logically indefensible  is part of the problem  to which a comprehensive solution is the most desirable  since it would resolve everything. But the best way to bring this about  free from outside interests  can only be direct communication between Seoul and Pyongyang  with the good offices of the Secretary-General.263.	The shooting down of a South Korean airliner is an event which profoundly moved the world. It was just one more link this year in the chain of dramatic events which have marked the life of the Korean people for years  sorely afflicting the Republic of Korea in particular.264.	The shooting down by Soviet Air Force aircraft of the Korean Air Lines jumbo jet on a routine flight between New York and Seoul is still the subject of hot debate and categorical denials. From its absolute denial of any knowledge of or participation in the incident  the Soviet Union went to the other extreme of acknowledging the incident. At the Madrid follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the Soviet Foreign Minister stated that whoever violated the frontiers of the Soviet Union knew what to expect. The peremptory tone of that statement makes one think of a deliberate  horrifying act. But he went further with regard to this particular case  saying that the aircraft that committed the incursion did not obey orders to fly towards a Soviet airport  but tried to escape  and the Soviet interceptor carried out the orders from the higher command to put an end to the flight. Drawing from an indefensible situation general ethical and political principles  which require a different base to have any validity  the Soviet Foreign Minister threatened that if anyone raised his hand against the Soviet Union's spiritual  social and civic values  if there was any premeditated attempt to exacerbate international tension  such actions would receive he response they deserved. That is to put things in the passive  and no one summed up the thoughts prompted by the statements of the Soviet Foreign Minister better than the United States Secretary of State  George Shultz  who said that the Soviet Union's concept of defensive methods made one think that such acts could be repeated. He added  in a most impressive comment  that there were many ways of defending Soviet territory  but they must be compatible with human rights.265.	Given the high level of technology achieved by the Soviet Union  it is inexplicable and unbelievable that it was unable to make a complete and correct identification of the South Korean commercial airliner in order to coordinate it with the schedule of its normal flights and with the number of passengers it normally carries. These data are not secret  but information which is routinely available.266.	These circumstances make the various explanations provided unlikely and show the true value of the Soviet Foreign Minister's words. In the version which admits that the shooting down of the jumbo jet and the resulting death of 269 passengers of various nationalities were a  mistake   it was maintained that the Soviet pilots took the aircraft for a reconnaissance aircraft. According to Viktor Linnik  a counselor in the department of international information of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  in a statement published by the Madrid press   They never thought it was a civilian aircraft. If they had known  the decision would have been quite different. I am absolutely certain of that.  That is not what the Soviet Foreign Minister says  nor is it what logic dictates  considering the sophisticated means of aerial and remote sensing at the disposal of a super-Power such as the Soviet Union.267.	As soon as he learned of this incredible and terrible event  the President of the Republic of Paraguay  General Alfredo Stroessner  sent the following message to the Secretary-General: The people and Government of Paraguay join with me in rejecting and vigorously condemning the barbarous crime perpetrated against the peace-loving  free Republic of South Korea by the Soviet air force. We denounce before the highest world body  of which Your Excellency is Secretary-General  this new  infamous act of aggression against mankind. We ask you  Sir  to make public our denunciation and condemnation of the unpunished murder of the nearly 300 innocent passengers who were travelling on board the Korean Air Lines Boeing 747. 268.	At the same time  President Stroessner sent a message to the President of the United States  Ronald Reagan  which read as follows: Communist barbarism has claimed further innocent victims  among them a member of the Congress of your nation  Mr. Larry McDonald  who was lost in the destruction of the South Korean KAL Boeing 747 passenger aircraft at the hands of the Russian air force. In the face of this heinous and unprecedented crime against humanity by the Soviet Union  and of the grief suffered by your people and your friendly country  I express  on behalf of the Paraguayan people and its Government  over which I preside  our most vigorous condemnation and rejection of this brutal act  as evidence in this tragic circumstance of our sympathy and solidarity with Your Excellency and with the noble American people. 269.	A third message was sent by President Stroessner to his South Korean counterpart  M:. Chun Doo-Hwan. That message stated: The savage crime committed by Soviet communism  of which mankind itself was the victim  has filled the Paraguayan people with horror. In the name of that people and of the Government of which I am President  and on my own behalf  I wish to convey to you our solidarity and sincere condolences. We vigorously reject this new act of barbarism committed by Russian terrorism  and we condemn the murderous aggression which sacrificed so many innocent lives through the destruction of the peaceful commercial Boeing 747 aircraft of Korean Air Lines. 270.	There is no need to make any further explanation of the position of Paraguay with regard to this horrifying incident  which is incomprehensible from any standpoint.271.	With regard to Kampuchea  since Viet Nam invaded that country in 1978 very little progress has been achieved  either internally or militarily  towards the true liberation of that country.272.	Since 1979  when the question was first considered by the General Assembly  at its thirty-fourth session  the Republic of Paraguay has taken an unswerving position  which may be summed up in the following terms.273.	First  the current Government in Phnom Penh is illegal  because it was imposed by force by an invading army.274.	Secondly  while Paraguay never recognized the communist regime of Pol Pot  it is that regime or its successor which is entitled to a seat in the General Assembly because of the simple fact that the Assembly has never revoked its decision to recognize it as the de facto Government.273. Thirdly  the Republic of Paraguay supports the recommendation of the International Conference on Kampuchea  in which it participated  that a political settlement be reached which should provide  infer for the complete withdrawal of all foreign troops  the neutrality of the country and the holding of free elections under United Nations supervision for the formation of a new Government.276. Fourthly  the Republic of Paraguay sees as a positive step the formation  in mid-3982  of a tripartite Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea under the presidency of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.277.	Fifthly  the position of the Republic of Paraguay is consistent with its past record on the question  inasmuch as its delegation participated in the debate on it and was among the sponsors of resolution 37/6  which was adopted by the Assembly by an overwhelming majority.278.	The Republic of Paraguay attaches to the question of Afghanistan a great political and even historical importance  because it concerns the first clear-cut case of invasion and military occupation by the Soviet Union of a neighbouring country whose tradition  culture  religion and race have very little in common with those of the invading State. The Soviet Union has been unable to show incontrovertibly that it has not violated  at the least  the principles of the self-determination of peoples and of non-interference in their internal affairs  principles which are the very essence of international coexistence and are a facet of the equality of nations in the eyes of the lawâ thus challenging the fundamental premises of the United Nations.279.	The position of the Republic of Paraguay on the tragedy of the Afghan nation remains unchanged and may be summed up as follows: first  unreserved condemnation of the Soviet invasion and military occupation of Afghanistan; secondly  support for the demand for the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops; thirdly  support for the world information programme on the Afghan question  in order to make public opinion more aware of this subjugation aspect of international communism  translated into action in the case of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union itself; fourthly  support for the good offices of the Secretary-General; and fifthly  support for a peaceful solution of the conflict.280.	With regard to the question of the Middle East  my delegation believes that this conflict  by virtue of its complexity and the many clearly discordant elements which combine to make it more dangerous and explosive  poses a serious threat to world peace. Over the years  this problem has taken a variety of forms  and it is one of the oldest in the history of the United Nations. At its various stages or situations  the Republic of Paraguay has unfailingly contributed its views and its vote  remaining unswervingly true to the principles of the United Nations.281.	In its present state  the Middle East conflict requires close attention and the utmost wisdom on the part of the Secretary-General in order to prevent the crisis from reaching the point of no return and to keep open the option of negotiations. It is of the greatest importance that the super-Powers too should proceed on these lines  for the sake of world peace and common security.282.	In any case  with the problem evolving rapidly and in circumstances of highly justified expectations because of the turn taken by the conflict  the Republic of Paraguay wishes to restate on this occasion its support for any solution or solutions proposed that are in keeping with the principles of the United Nations  so that the peoples and nations concerned in this explosive affair can see their aspirations met  in keeping with the justice of their demands  so that international law can find new points of support for its valid and practical implementation in a world which so urgently needs to be kept safe from any bellicose inclination which could throw it into the abyss of destruction.283.	There are many other situations. Some are as important as that in the Middle East  but for the sake of brevity my delegation will confine itself to reaffirming the unchanging position of the Republic of Paraguay in the defense of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We shall accordingly remain unswervingly loyal to the resolutions of the Organization and the efforts of the Secretary-General in the constant search for peaceful solutions which unite and strengthen  without leaving ill effects.284.	I have already anticipated certain references to disarmament  but my delegation wishes to highlight certain further aspects  to make some comments and to confirm its position on the problem of arms and its ideal remedy  which is disarmament.285.	First  it should be borne in mind that the Republic of Paraguay was a sponsor of General Assembly resolution 37/71  concerning Additional Protocol I of the Treaty of Tlatelolco to both of which my country is a party. That resolution contained an appeal to the nuclear Powers which have not yet done so to ratify Additional Protocol I. This year  consistent with its unchanging position  Paraguay was among the countries which called for the inclusion of a new item on the agenda for this session on the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.286.	The arms race  on which my delegation has already taken a stand  has reached outrageous proportions in the last decades. It has been stated that last year military expenditures exceeded the sum of $800 billion; we can imagine what a dizzying peak could have been reached were it not that the world is passing through a grave economic crisis which is internationally imposing drastic financial restrictions  a situation which affects even the basic priorities of most nations.287.	This is a phenomenon which shows no signs of shrinking or receding but on which we must constantly dwell  appealing to and urging the super-Powers and the industrial Powers to give the easing of tension and disarmament a permanent place in their concerns and initiatives  so that achievements on this decisive level of world security can be reflected and have a moral influence at other levels  secondary  perhaps  yet still important to world peace and the tranquillity of nations. In particular  an end should be put to the paradox of countries which are devoured by elementary subsistence needs but are still squandering their resources in a frenzied arms race to produce the most sophisticated conventional weapons  a race which can only bankrupt them.288.	The position of the Republic of Paraguay has been and remains one of supporting all efforts aimed at a rational reduction of arms expenditures  keeping them at levels compatible with defence and world security. Disarmament must be the result of joint efforts  proportionate and properly balanced among all parties which seek this objective  and consequently any proposals for unilateral disarmament  or disproportion disarmament  are out of order and would raise doubts about the good faith of those advocating them.289.	On the problem of refugees  my delegation first wishes to say that for humanitarian reasons and in order to avoid further aggravation of this problem which has involved so much human suffering  it is concerned that the resolution adopted in 1981 has not yet been implemented. It was decided to set up a group of experts to make recommendations on this serious problem of refugees  but it has been stated that the regional groups have not been able to agree on the distribution of posts. That is deplorable  because it means that side issues are impeding the attainment of a higher aim which is in the highest interests of the Organization.290.	My delegation urges the relevant parties to overcome the difficulties  which seem illusory or based on self- interest  so that the work of the group of experts can begin  work which can be of great help in solving the problem which  for whatever reason  has tended to get worse and may very well become an instrument of political speculation and international pressure  particularly when it affects territories neighbouring the countries from which the refugees flee  so that the resentments aroused are added to the humanitarian and economic problems generated by these situations.291.	As to the world economic crisis  I would point out that we are advancing into the Third United Nations Development Decade without having achieved the aims which inspired  two decades ago now  the declaration of these Decades with specific goals and principles.292.	In 1960  the need for an international development strategy was discussed. The General Assembly proclaimed the 1960s as the first United Nations Development 	during which period the greatest international financing efforts were to be centered especially on the underdeveloped countries. But that proposal did not include any effective plan to co-ordinate the different national policies and to bring about generally positive results. Ten years later  for the decade of the 1970s  the General Assembly  at the time that it proclaimed the Second United Nations Development Decade  also approved the International Development Strategy to serve as a guide for the plans and policies of Governments.293.	At the request of Venezuela  there was included in the agenda of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly an item entitled  Launching of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development  and decision 35/443 was approved  in which the President of the Assembly was requested to continue unofficial consultations with a view to arriving at an agreement for the launching of these negotiations within the framework of the Third United Nations Development Decade. Up to the last session of the General Assembly no progress had been achieved on this  but regardless of what is reported this year  it is appropriate to emphasize the legitimate interest of the developing nations in particular in a more effective handling of this problem  since they are less capable of defending themselves against a prolonged world crisis. Efforts must be made to avoid any dislocation that would jeopardize what has already been achieved  if not in reducing the gap between them and the rich countries  at least in maintaining in operation the development plans which are vital for them and which should not be subjected to any further interruptions or postponements.294.	My delegation has a particular interest in the subject of new and renewable sources of energy  because of experiences which place the Republic of Paraguay in a privileged position in the world in terms of the development of new and renewable sources of energy.295.	First I should like to make some comments on the history of this item in the Organization. In 1978  under resolution 33/148  the General Assembly decided to convene an international conference on new and renewable sources of energy  which was held at Nairobi three years later  in 1981. Paraguay participated in that conference.296.	Subsequently  at the thirty-sixth session  the General Assembly endorsed the Nairobi Programme of Action for the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energies and  among other things  decided to establish an interim committee to which was entrusted the initiation of that Programme. However  unfortunately  one year later  at the thirty-seventh session  in 1982  the General Assembly noted that nothing had been done  and therefore it established the Committee on the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy  recommending the immediate initiation of the Programme to which I have referred. The Committee remains open to participation by all Member States.297.	My delegation would like to emphasize the support of Paraguay for all the actions of the Organization for the establishment of machinery to ensure the securing o resources and technologies to promote the carrying out of specific projects within the Nairobi Programme. It is to be hoped that at this session the Committee will be able to offer something new with regard to the progress of its work.298.	The Republic of Paraguay for years now has been carrying out with the utmost seriousness a programme of energy production to free itself from thermal factories  which are insatiable devourers of valuable forestry resources  whether wood or charcoal  or which  in a country that has no oil  require very expensive imports  greater each year  if they require oil to function. The experience of the country has been encouraging in these respects  and the Government decided in the mid-1950s to establish a hydroelectric energy project  using the different levels of an internal river  the Acaray. With financial assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank and with the generous support of Brazil in carrying out the project  the work was completed within the planned time limit and had the intended effects. Clean hydroelectric energy totally replaced that which had been produced by thermal means  and the gainer in all this was the ecology of the country. Sources of pollution were eliminated  and forestry was restored in the areas of Asuncion  which had been the most deforested. The original factory of Acaray was duplicated  and another dam was built at a higher level to increase the water reserve.299.	Apart from the national hydroelectric energy programme  within which other projects are still being developed  the Republic of Paraguay  together with the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Argentine Republic  by means of treaties it has with each of them  participates on an equal basis in the gigantic project at Itaipu  which is almost finished  and a similar one at Yacyreta. The first  which is the largest of its kind in the world  is soon to begin energy production with the installation  which is now almost ready  of its first turbines  which will number 18 in all and will produce more than 12 million kilowatts. As regards the Yacyreta project  undertaken jointly with Argentina  after many difficulties and postponements and with a great deal of support work and infrastructure which has already been completed  the work now seems well on the way. It enjoys the political support of the parties  and it is necessary for the development of a broad region of the Southern Cone of America and will stimulate new forms of integration. Therefore it is to be hoped that it will have the support of the wealthy countries and international financial agencies  since such is well merited in view of the fact that its energy production will be approximately half that of Itaipu and the fact that when the work is completed and production begins it will constitute an invulnerable insurance against inflation and the passage of time.300.	My delegation cannot omit a special reference  however brief  to the subject of trade and development  which it believes to be of great importance. In this connection  for obvious reasons  since it is a land-locked country  Paraguay awaits with interest and will follow with great attention the evaluation of the report of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development '  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  and the examination of the draft resolution entitled  Specific action related to the particular needs and problems of land-locked developing countries .301.	On this subject  my delegation wishes to emphasize the good relations it maintains with its large maritime neighbours  which have made possible the satisfactory development of agreements which will give Paraguay access to the sea. The purpose is to continue improving understandings and bring about better means of integration through communications and river  rail and road transport  through which my country will have easier access to the ports of three countries: Argentina  Brazil and Uruguay.302.	As for the report on the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  the Republic of Paraguay confirms its position and expresses its confidence that the difficulties in arriving at concrete and satisfactory results will finally be overcome.303.	Access to scientific and technological knowledge and mastery thereof are indispensable for countries' development. The Organization is understanding this more clearly  although the results are not yet fully satisfactory. Consequently it continues to be a subject of high priority  and therefore we would stress the need to broaden and intensify international co-operation in the area of science and technology for development and to give particular attention to the development of these technologies as they apply to the conditions of the developing countries.304.	In order to put the programme into effect  the General Assembly decided in 1979 to establish an Intergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Development  but this Committee  as was to be expected from the nature of the problems for which it was to propose solutions  particularly those connected with financing  was involved in long and difficult negotiations. We still need to produce a plan with the consensus necessary to ensure that it is practical and viable  and in this regard my delegation trusts that the timely directives of the Secretary-General to stimulate the necessary studies will promote the success of this initiative  which will be to the credit of our Organization.305.	UNDP is of great interest to the developing countries  and therefore priority should be given to solving the financial crisis which is hampering its development. The Committee of the Whole of the Governing Council has explained the position as follows. First  there is a crisis of expectations  since it had been hoped to reach an annual growth rate of 14 per cent  as laid down in 1979 by the General Assembly in resolution 34/106. Secondly  there is an accounting crisis  in view of the unexpected depreciation of the currencies in relation to the dollar. Thirdly  there is a crisis of remunerations  because of the high cost of providing experts for the developing countries.306.	It is to be hoped that the report of the Governing Council on the problems facing UNDP will contain sufficient elements to provide for a viable solution to the problem at this session of the General Assembly.307.	In connection with special economic assistance and help in cases of disaster  my delegation wishes to place on record the gratitude of the Government of the Republic of Paraguay  which on 27 May 1983 asked UNDRO to appeal for the solidarity of the international community to help those who suffered from the severe floods caused by the exceptional rise of the Paraguay and Parana Rivers.308.	Through consultation with the resident representative of UNDRO and UNDP in Asuncion and the authorities of the Paraguayan Government  a list of necessities was drawn up and was duly covered by contributions from the Government and international assistance  not to mention the solidarity and co-operation received from the entire Paraguayan people in the emergency  because of which a disaster psychology did not spread at any time. The UNDRO representative sent especially to Paraguay had occasion to verify on the spot the operational capacity achieved for the necessary help to be given.309.	With regard to the convention against mercenaries  whose preparation has been long and difficult  the item was included in the agenda of the General Assembly for the first time in 1979. Since then it has been considered every year  given the importance attached to it by various nations and groups of nations with often conflicting criteria.310.	In relation to the various draft conventions submitted for the consideration of the ad hoc Committee created in 1980   the position of the Paraguayan delegation  on express instructions from the national Government  has always been one of wholehearted support for the adoption of a legal text on the subject. In particular  with regard to the primary item of the definition of  mercenary   it highlighted the need for a more current concept of this word  bringing it more into line with the general realities of our time. Thus a mercenary will not be just a foreigner who participates for pay in a fight that has nothing to do with him  but also one who for ideological reasons enlists as a volunteer in the internal struggles of other countries. Such attitudes are contrary to the peoples' right to self-determination and the principle of non-intervention in their internal affairs. In support of this position of my delegation  I quote paragraph 1 of article I of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  which reads as follows: All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic  social and cultural development. 311.	With regard to the law of the sea  the Republic of Paraguay  which is situated more than 1 000 kilometres from the nearest port  has followed with constant interest the evolution of the law of the sea. As long ago as 1971  at the General Assembly of the Organization of American States  my country set down its position in the following terms: The Republic of Paraguay is a landlocked State  and geographical and historical circumstances have deprived it of the extraordinary benefits of enjoying a coastline. Nevertheless  Paraguay has the right to enjoy the freedom of the high seas  unrestricted navigation thereon  fishing resources and the subjacent resources and the air space over it. And  to the extent that States with a coastline arbitrarily increase their sovereignty by increasing their territorial sea  they are thereby arbitrarily limiting the rights of the Republic of Paraguay and all other land-locked States. 312.	Therefore  my delegation considers that the year 1982 was of surpassing importance in the history of the development of the law of the sea. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which began in 1973âa decade agoâconcluded its work. On 10 December 1982 in Montego Bay  the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  the fruit of such arduous and long-drawn-out work  was opened for signature. Paraguay signed the Final Act  confirming its commitment to participate actively in the establishment of a more just juridical order for the seas.313.	We have left the subject of terrorism to the end of our statement. Terrorism is one of the thorniest problems of our time and is frequently to be found at the root of other more serious conflicts because they have international implications. This is confirmed by the fact that in the face of the extraordinary resurgence of acts of terrorism in the 1970s  the General Assembly decided to include on the agenda of its twenty-seventh session an item on measures which could be adopted to prevent terrorist activities. Since that timeâthat is  1972  the year which saw the setting up of the Roc Committee on International Terrorismâthe item has come back to the Assembly every two years except for 1973 and 1977; but in fact there has been no clear-cut progress.314.	In the Sixth Committee  in which this item is traditionally considered  there continues to be a strong divergence of opinion over the definition of terrorism and the emphasis which should be placed on suppressing this phenomenon and eliminating its underlying causes. With respect to the latter  the vagueness and the political propaganda are the factors making agreement more difficult. As we know  there are countries and groups of countries which believe that what the Assembly should recommend is that Governments take measures to eliminate the causes of terrorism  thereby implicitly justifying it as an element of political struggle for as long as these causes persist  causes which may be real but also may be pretended for propaganda purposes.315.	However  we must recognize that this lack of agreement in arriving at an international convention on terrorism and ways of combating it adds another problem  which is all the questioning and criticisms encountered by the anti-terrorist struggle on the part of countries and sectors which allow it as a valid political element. Hence  for lack of clear and uniform criteria and for lack of a universally accepted agreement  the situation benefits terrorism  against which there are no sanctions  and is prejudicial to government authorities  so frequently accused of sinister violations.316.	My delegation would like to set on record once again the categorical rejection by the Government of the Republic of Paraguay of terrorism and of all forms of extremism and violence as contrary to democracy and peace. Paragraph 3 of article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that: The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures. 317.	This essential stipulation for democracy is incompatible with terrorism  whose pernicious effects frequently aggravate the causes on which it is based before these causes are eliminated.318.	Finally  again with regard to terrorism  we may invoke  only to despair of its lack of effect  the norm laid down in article 30 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  since no person or group of persons can invoke it  to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein ."
"112",5855,"QAT",38,1983,"ï»¿106.	It gives me great pleasure to extend to you at the outset of my statement  Sir  my warmest congratulations on the well-deserved confidence shown in electing you President of the thirty-eighth session. You are most worthy of and qualified for tins important responsibility. I am sure that your long experience and your skill will be of immense help in your noble task of guiding the session towards the desired goals  for the attainment of which we shall all exert our sincere efforts.107.	T  gives me pleasure also to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  for the manner in which he led the work of the last session. In so doing he earned our appreciation and esteem.108.	I should like also to express  with great respect  our thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General for the honest and sincere efforts he steadily makes to attain the Organization's goals. Like the rest of us  his belief in those goals has a noble and human dimension  on the basis of which all the obstacles and problems blocking the road to their attainment can be overcome. Perhaps the best evidence of the Secretary-General's enthusiasm and determination is his report on the work of the Organization in which he realistically describes the problems besetting the international communityâproblems that have weakened and shaken it  indeed almost pushing it to the abyssâthe effective and constructive role that the United Nations must necessarily play and the worthy remedies he proposes for those problems.109.	I also extend the warmest welcome and congratulations to the State of Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission to the United Nations as a new Member. We wish it all success in contributing to the achievement of the noble goals of the United Nations.110.	Years pass and international problems remain unchangedâif they do not become worse and more complicated. The situation in the Middle East remains unchanged  as does the situation with regard to the Iran- Iraq war. The situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea continue to deteriorate and tensions in Central America increase  as does racial oppression in South Africa. And all that is in addition to the economic and social deterioration that has beset the world.111.	It goes without saying that the super-Powers bear the greatest share of the responsibility for all these circumstances  for on every occasion they work for the advancement of their own special interests at the expense of the common international interest. The world has witnessed the super-Powers exploiting these situations  not in order to resolve them but  rather  as part of the strategic balance of those super-Powers.112.	The impotence of the United Nations in regard to resolving these issues is a true reflection of the international situation; the international Organization is being increasingly pushed to the margin of events by the superpowers instead of being allowed to act as the basic and principal mechanism for solving them.113.	The best example of this is the Palestinian question. The world is aware that everything that happens in the Middle East is a natural and expected result of that question  which is the core of what is known as theMiddle East problem. The best evidence of the international community's awareness of the importance of this issue is the convening of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  at Geneva  under the auspices of the United Nations  to prove to the world as a whole that the use of force to occupy the territory of others and usurp it from its people and to expel that people to various parts of the world does not mean that it will be silenced or that this is the end of the road for it.114.	The State of Qatar fully supports the content of the Geneva Declaration on Palestine and the Programme of Action for the Achievement of Palestinian Rights adopted at that Conference  calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem; the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to return to their homeland and have their property restored  to self- determination and to establish an independent State; recognition of the PLO as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people; and stopping the creation of new Israeli settlements and removing those already built in occupied Arab territories.115.	One of the biggest challenges facing the United Nations is Israel's continuing racist policy against the Palestinian people and its continued use of the policy ofapartheid through consistent aggression to reinforce its attempt to distract the world with new adventures to cover the old.116.	American support for Israel in its continued disregard of United Nations resolutions  especially those of the Security Council  and its continuous military and financial support have made Israel a force for the implementation and application of American strategy in the Arab world at the expense of the legitimate interests of the States of the region. It goes without saying that only a just stand by the United States on this issue could restore balance and establish peace in the region.117.	The Israeli aggression against brotherly Lebanon will be an everlasting disgrace to Zionism. Israel  by its inhuman action  has caused the splitting up and destabilization of an Arab country. The continued presence of its troops on Lebanese territory is evidence of its aggressive nature and its inhumanity.118.	In the name of the State of Qatar  I call upon the international community to do all it can to condemn the Zionist entity for this heinous action and to force it to withdraw completely from all Lebanese territory  instead of supplying it with machinery for war and destruction and providing it with political cover for its disgraceful aggressive policies. We appeal for the implementation of Security Council resolutions calling for immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and the cessation of its interference in the internal affairs of that country and incitement of civil strife among the Lebanese people.119.	We stand with all firmness for Lebanon's independence  unity and territorial integrity  so that it may again know stability and prosperity.120.	The worthy efforts of brotherly Saudi Arabia  the use of its good offices to secure the unity of Lebanon and the outstanding results it has achievedânamely  the agreement on a cease-fire between the conflicting parties and the movement from the dialogue of arms to the negotiating tableâtestify to the ability of the international community to overcome problems and remove obstacles when its intentions are forthright and sincere. While praising the sincere efforts of Saudi Arabia  we look forward to the support of the family of nations for those efforts  so that stability may return to the whole of Lebanese territory and to all segments of the Lebanese population.121.	The ongoing battles on the boundaries of our region are a source of continuing concern. Those battles have entered their fourth year  causing a great deal of destruction. Their escalation threatens not only the warring countries but also the region as a whole  a region of vital importance to the world at large.122.	Through the Gulf Co-operation Council we have made great and sincere efforts  through the repeated contacts undertaken by Sheikh Sabah AI-Ahmad Al- Jaber Al-Sabah  Deputy Prime Minister  Foreign Minister and Information Minister of the State of Kuwait  and Mr. Rashid Abdullah Al-Nuaimi  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates  with the two warring countries. Similarly  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations have made great efforts in this respect. We still hope that those efforts will be successful in ending the state of war.123.	While appreciating the positive attitude displayed by the Government of Iraq in order to reach a solution to this problem  we express from this rostrum the hope that our Muslim neighbour  the Islamic Republic of Iran  will respond to those efforts in order to achieve a solution that will end the shedding of Muslin blood and allow the two countries to devote their attention to the reconstruction of what the war has destroyed and to contribute to international peace and security.124.	The State of Qatar categorically rejects the use of force to settle disputes. It believes in the right of all peoples to self-determination. Based on that stand  we hope for the success of the United Nations efforts to bring back normal life to Afghanistan and to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign forces from this friendly Muslim country  allowing its people to choose the political and social system that best suits it and to live in the manner it chooses and desires.125.	Similarly  with regard to the situation in South Africa and Namibia  in keeping with our belief in the principles of the United Nations we condemn the policies of apartheid and racial segregation practiced by the ruling racist regime in South Africa against the national majority. We reaffirm our support for the people of South Africa and their right to national independence and for the just struggle of the Namibian people for independence and self-determination under the leadership of SWAPO  its sole legitimate representative. We also reaffirm our support for and solidarity with the frontline African States in their stand against repeated South African aggression.126.	The current international economic conditions are a natural by-product of the economic policies pursued by the super-Powers and the industrialized countries. Those policies are based strictly on a narrow regional outlook and not on the interests of the international community. They do not take into account the inter-dependency and interaction necessary for the flourishing of the international economy as a whole.127.	The continuance of these trends and the failure to take into account the common international good will result  as it has in the past  in a negative impact on the international community in a way that may be incurable in the future and may cause the collapse of international economic relations.128.	The current international economic situation has had .a negative impact on the oil market  which in turn has affected the countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and made it impossible for them to accept any new financial obligations. Therefore the State of Qatar does not see the necessity for the creation of new financing mechanisms. We should instead concentrate on strengthening existing mechanisms and restructuring them in accordance with ongoing international economic changes. Despite this  the State of Qatar  together with its brothers in the Gulf Co-operation Council  makes every effort to aid the developing countries and endeavours to increase the channels of co-operation with them  considering this to be a noble and humanitarian goal.129.	The problems facing developing countries  ranging from inflation to the increase in the prices of imported goods  in addition to the debt problem  do not escape our notice.130.	All the problems and issues that I have surveyed may constitute human worries that could be cured with good will and the placing of the common interest above everything else. However  the most dangerous of all problems for mankind is the insane race towards the production and ownership of the tools of mass destruction  whether nuclear or hydrogen bombs.131.	What harm would it do us if we utilized these great capabilities in the service of man  to improve his life  secure his future  reclaim the land  and narrow the gap between rich countries and those still developing? We are called upon to face up to a real challenge represented in the relationship between disarmament and development. Are we able and willing to accept this challenge?132.	We attach great hopes to this Organization. We sincerely trust that we shall all be successful in realizing those hopes  so that we may create a society in which all will enjoy security  stability and peace. 	"
"113",5901,"ROU",38,1983,"ï»¿112.	 It gives me particular pleasure  Sir  to extend to you heartfelt congratulations on your election to the office of President of the General Assembly and to greet you as the representative of a country with which Romania maintains close relations of friendship and co-operation.113.	I should also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm to the Secretary-General the appreciation and support of the Romanian Government for his work in the interests of international peace  co-operation and understanding.114.	The present session of the General Assembly is taking place against a background of complex and contradictory problems of international life  which have aggravated the world situation. The peoples of the world are deeply concerned about the rapid escalation of the arms race  primarily the nuclear arms race  the perpetuation of conflicts and hotbeds of tension and the emergence of new ones  and the widening of the gap between the rich and poor countries.115.	Lifeâindeed  realityâdemonstrates that logic  political realism and the spirit of co-operation are being increasingly replaced by growing mistrust  tension and confrontation. Artificial factors have been exacerbated. Differences that are ideological in nature  deriving from differing social and political systems  have been transferred to the area of inter-State relations  and some local conflict situations have been placed in the context of disputes between the opposing blocs. The struggle for spheres of influence and zones of domination is intensifying. 116. It can be said that we are today witnessing in the international arena a grave undermining of the policy of peaceful co-existence  which has been unanimously accepted by all the peoples of the world as the only alternative to the outbreak of a conflagration. Given this reality  which creates a menacing atmosphere in international life  being a serious threat to the sovereignty and freedom of many nations  it is more than ever necessary to act with increasing determination against the policy of force and diktat; for halting the growing confrontation and resuming the policy of cooperation  detente and peace; and for the establishment between States of new relations based on full equality of rights  strict observance by all States in all circumstances of national independence and sovereignty  non-interference in the internal affairs of others  mutual benefit and the right of each people to decide its own destiny.118.	We are convinced that in the world-wide confrontation between these diametrically opposed tendenciesâ on the one hand  that of domination  aggression and diktat  and on the other that of the determination and justified aspirations of the overwhelming majority of States to enjoy independence  freedom and peaceâwe can and must see the triumph of the policy of reason  of right over might  and of international understanding and security.119.	Because of their responsibility for the fate of mankind and the sacred right of peoples to existence  life  freedom and peace  all States are duty-bound to act in a constructive and co-operative spirit  which should be reflected in the debates  the results and the resolutions of this session of the General Assembly. States must contribute effectively to halting the trend towards confrontation  to substantially improving the international atmosphere and to solving  in the interests of the peoples  the serious and complex problems today confronting mankind.120.	Starting from the basic and irreversible premise of the Romanian people  its vocation for peace and cooperation  the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania  Nicolae Ceausescu  has stated:""We deem it necessary to act now  through concrete measures  to lessen international tension and to resume the policy of detente  and not to take any action which could aggravate the international situation  so that all States act with the highest responsibility towards their own peoples  the general cause of peace and international security"".121.	The time elapsed since the previous session has shown without a doubt that the worsening of the international situation  the growth of the danger of war  the increase in tension among States and the deepening world economic crisis are generated primarily by the intensification of the arms race  first of all the nuclear arms race.122.	A lucid analysis of the present situation  as well as United Nations documents  reveal an alarming fact  namely  that the world has reached such a level of armaments  has accumulated such a quantity of all types of weapons  particularly nuclear weapons  that the very existence of civilization and even of life on our planet is in danger.123.	In these circumstances  the fundamental problem of our time is to prevent war  safeguard peace  halt the arms race  move towards disarmament  above all nuclear disarmament  and establish a military balance  not by accumulating new armaments but by reducing existing armaments to the lowest level possible.124.	It is in Europe that there is the greatest concentration of armaments  including nuclear armaments. It is in Europe that the two opposing military blocs face one another  blocs created  as is well known  during the period of the ""cold war""  blocs that foment mistrust and confrontation. The situation demands strong and consistent measures to eliminate the bloc policy  to reduce the military activities of the two blocs  to narrow the geographic area of military competition  to eliminate the nuclear danger from the widest possible areas and to ensure the widest possible military disengagement.125.	At present the crucial problem for Europe is the danger of the deployment this very year of new medium- range missiles  which would open the v ay to the escalation of the arms race and increase the danger of war  above all nuclear war  thus threatening the life of all the European peoplesâindeed  life itselfâand human civilization.126.	Romania considers that there is no justification for accepting as a fait accompli the deployment of new nuclear missiles. On the contrary  everything should be done to avoid this very serious step while there is still time and while it is still possible. States and Governments that decide to deploy new missiles on their territories will assume a great responsibility towards their own peoples and  indeed  towards humanity as a whole.127.	Romania believes that through new efforts  through negotiations carried out in a spirit of co-operation and of great responsibility on both sides  it is possible to reach an appropriate agreement which would put an end to the deployment of new missiles and ensure the withdrawal and destruction of existing missiles.""128.	Proceeding from this basic premise  the President of Romania  Nicolae Ceausescu  recently sent messages to the President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  Yuri Andropov  and to the President of the United States  Ronald Reagan  [see	urging them to do everything possible to ensure that no new nuclear weapons be deployed. Romania has proposed that  in the event that by the end of this year negotiations have not reached positive results  there be agreement to postpone the deployment of new medium-range missiles at least until the end of 1984 or the beginning of 1985  and that negotiations be continued. In the meantime  the Soviet Union should  in the spirit of its earlier statements  guarantee that it would stop the deployment of new medium-range missiles  stop modernizing them and unilaterally reduce the number of those deployed in the European part of Soviet territory. In addition  the President of Romania has proposed  in the event that no agreement is reached on these proposals  at least the non-deployment of medium-range missiles in the territories of the Federal Republic of Germany  the German Democratic Republic  the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and other States  as an intermediate measure pending the conclusion of a final agreement in the framework of the Geneva negotiations.129.	Bearing in mind that the subject of the Soviet- American negotiations concerns the security and life of all European peoples  we consider it necessary that the other European States also participate in an appropriate form in these talks  or that direct negotiations be initiated between the countries parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the member States of NATO on the question of medium- range nuclear arms.130.	In general we are of the view that  since what is involved is the safeguarding of the vital interests of peace and security of all peoplesâindeed  their very lifeâall States have the right and duty to express themselves and make their contributions to the efforts to stop the arms race and achieve concrete disarmament measures  primarily for nuclear disarmament. In this regard  we believe that all States are duty-bound  because of the obligations entered into under the Charter  to co-operate in a responsible manner to ensure the effective use of the framework provided by the United Nations and the Committee on Disarmament to bring about the cessation of the arms race and disarmament.131.	It is now more than ever necessary to do everything possible to put an end to the policy of armaments  to defend the vital right of human beings and peoples to existence  independence and peace. This requires determined efforts to achieve without further delay concrete and meaningful new steps towards nuclear disarmament  in particular cessation of the production of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of existing stockpiles until they are completely eliminated  freezing the development and deployment of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction and the definitive prohibition of all nuclear armaments and other weapons of mass destruction.132.	The acceleration of the arms race is a major factor in the deepening world economic crisis. It feeds war propaganda  generates among the popular masses a psychosis of uncertainty and insecurity and creates distrust and suspicion in international life. The peoples must be told the plain truth that nuclear weapons are weapons of death and destruction  not weapons of peace and security  and that we cannot wait until nuclear weapons are used  because then it will be too late. We must not disregard the fact that there can always be irresponsible individuals ready to pull the trigger  or that by an unfortunate accident the nuclear destruction of the human race could be unleashed.133.	Proceeding from the premise that the annual growth in arms expenditures  the increase in geometric proportions of all types of armaments and the deployment of new nuclear missiles is detrimental to all countries and cuts deep into the budget allocations for social needs  the development of science  education  art and culture and the protection of the environment  Romania stands firmly for a reduction in military expenditures.134.	It is a truism that the pace of the arms race very seriously pollutes the international atmosphere and makes people's lives a real nightmare. Confronted with the option of life or the nuclear holocaust  the European peoples and the peoples of all continents commit themselves with increasing determination to the struggle for disarmament and peace. Now  before it is too late  millions of people of all ages  of various philosophical and religious convictions  are taking part in impressive peace movements and demonstrations  saying a resolute ""No"" to nuclear weapons and calling for an end to the arms race. To ignore the will of the peoples  not to listen to the forceful voice of world public opinion  is to go against the course of history and of reason and means poisoning the international atmosphere.135.	The strengthening of international peace and security requires that effective measures be agreed upon and implemented to achieve nuclear and conventional disarmament and to substantially reduce armaments and military forces  in order to increase confidence among States. While stressing the particular role and responsibility that attaches primarily to the powerfully armed States which possess nuclear arsenals  we also consider it necessary that all interested States participate directly in disarmament negotiations and have an opportunity to express themselves  so that no one is unaware of their wishes and their aspirations.136.	In the opinion of the Romanian Government  measures to halt the arms race and achieve disarmament should be taken in circumstances of mutual confidence and equal security  ensuring a military balance at ever lower levels and under strict international control  in order to guarantee full compliance by all States concerned with all the obligations assumed by them. Proceeding from this concept  Romania has strongly supported the establishment  within the United Nations framework  of an international body invested with the right to control and monitor the full implementation of measures agreed on to halt the arms race and achieve disarmament.137.	As a European country that has consistently worked for security and co-operation in our continent  Romania welcomed the results of the Madrid meeting which make it evident that even in complex and difficult international conditions there is no problem  however complicated  that cannot be resolved through negotiation when all concerned show political wisdom  a constructive spirit and a wish to co-operate  and when the primary interest of the people and of the peace and security of the whole world are borne in mind.138.	We regard as particularly positive the fact that at the Madrid meeting a consensus was reached on convening the Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe and that it was agreed to organize a number of meetings ensuring a continuation of the process initiated in the capital of Finland.139.	It is now extremely important to continue and consolidate the results obtained in promoting security and the development of co-operation in Europe. To this end  Romania has proposed that direct negotiations begin between the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the States members of NATO on the freezing and reduction of military expenditures  on disarmament and on the elimination of the danger of war. Bearing in mind the share of these States in world military expenditures and armaments  the conclusion of an agreement among States participating in the two military alliances would be an important contribution to the process of general disarmament. As far as Romania is concerned  it has decided to freeze its military budget at the 1982 level until 1985.140.	An important contribution to military disengagement and the strengthening of security and confidence among States would be the creation of nuclear-weapon- free zones in various parts of the world. The Romanian proposal on making the Balkans a zone of peace and good-neighbourliness  friendship and co-operation  free from nuclear weapons  foreign troops and military bases  is part of this effort.Ml. Events show that the anachronistic and profoundly dangerous policy of the use or threat of use of force in inter-State relations and of recourse to pressure and interference in the internal affairs of other States are a source of conflict and tension and unrest in international life. Such factors fuel the arms race and generate attacks on the peace  security and progress of peoples and their vital rights and aspirations.142.	The supreme interests of peoples  peace and international security demand the resolute elimination of the policy of force and the threat of force in every form and manifestation  the cessation of military actions and armed conflicts and the settlement of all disputes between States exclusively by peaceful means  by negotiation.143.	It is in the spirit of this position of principle that Romania believes that international bodies  above all the United Nations  must play a more active role and make a more effective contribution to bringing about and speeding up settlement of situations of tension and conflict solely through negotiations.144.	The inclusion in the agenda of the General Assembly of an item on the peaceful settlement of disputes between States  and the adoption by consensus at the last session of the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes are  of course  important positive steps which confirm the timeliness of efforts in this Held and demand a clear commitment by all States Members of the United Nations to continue to work together to achieve this basic goal.145.	Romania  along with other States  has presented a detailed proposal to this session of the General Assembly to set up within the framework of the United Nations a special body for good offices  mediation and conciliation the purpose of which would be to assist in preventing new military confrontations and in settling peacefully  through negotiation  conflicts and any other problems between States.146.	The same preoccupationâthe desire to contribute to strengthening peace and security at regional and international levels by developing relations of co-operation  mutual respect and understandingâis reflected in Romania's initiative on enhancing good-neighbourliness among States. The debates at recent sessions of the General Assembly have created appropriate conditions for beginning to develop this concept of good-neighbourliness and reaching agreement on the principles  ways and means for putting into practice such relations among all States.147.	Romania is deeply concerned over the persistence of serious hotbeds of tension and conflict in various parts of the planet. Of particular concern is the situation in that so heavily affected region  the Middle East.148.	The conflict in this area  including the disturbing situation in Lebanon  must be settled starting from the central priority problem  namely  ensuring the rights of the Palestinian people. In this respect it is necessary to begin negotiations as soon as possible. Romania  as is known  has come out in favour of organizing an international conference under United Nations auspices  with all interested parties participating  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the Soviet Union and the United States of America  in order to arrive at a comprehensive  lasting and just solution of the Middle East conflict. Such a settlement presupposes the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territories occupied after the 1967 war; the solution of the Palestine problem on the basis of the right of the Palestinian people to self- determination  including its right to establish its own independent State  and the guarantee of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the region.149.	At the same time  we advocate maintenance of the cease-fire in Lebanon  national reconciliation  the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon and respect for the independence  sovereignty  national unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon.150.	I should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm from this rostrum Romania's solidarity with and active support for the position and initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its efforts to ensure the peaceful and independent unification of that country.151.	In the spirit of Romania's traditional policy of supporting the struggle of peoples for freedom and independence  I should like to express once again the militant solidarity of the Romanian State and people with the Namibian people in its struggle to achieve independence without delay on the basis of United Nations resolutions. We also support the abolition of the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination in South Africa and the adoption of measures to force the Pretoria authorities to end once and for all their aggressive actions against neighbouring States.152.	The international economic situation  marked by increased signs of crisis  has brought about a profound upheaval in trade relations and economic co-operation among States which has had a negative effect on all States  but particularly on the developing ones by helping to perpetuate and broaden the gap between the rich and the poor countries.153.	Of particular concern are certain trends such as the extension of protectionist measures and discriminatory practices  the growing disproportion between the prices of raw materials and of manufactured goods  the increase in the external debt burden of developing countries and high interest rates for development loans  the reduction in aid programmes and hampering access to modem technology.154.	Given the growing interdependence between rich and poor countries  overcoming the economic crisis requires not only an upswing in the economic activities of the developed countries  but also a revitalization of the economic development process in the developing countries and the creation of the proper conditions for enabling those countries to regain their dynamic role in the world economy and in the growth of international trade.155.	It is the view of Romania and of its President  Nicolae Ceausescu  that the present negative situation in the world economy and particularly the seriousness of the economic situation of the developing countries urgently require establishment of genuine co-operation between developed and developing countries  based on the principles of equality and equity. This would ensure a speedy and lasting general recovery in the world economy  a resumption of the development process in the developing countries and the taking of concrete steps towards the establishment of a new  more just international economic order which would take account of the interests of all nations. In our view  that is a fundamental prerequisite for ensuring general economic stability and for improving the international political climate.156.	I wish to stress in particular the gravity of the developing countries' external debt to the developed countries  which has become a fundamental world-wide problem. A solution of that problem depends on halting the deterioration of the situation in the developing countries and in achieving world economic stability. We consider it necessary to cancel the debts of the poorest countries and to reduce the debts of other countries proportionately with their per capita national income and reschedule them over a longer period of time  interest- free or at a low rate of interest. As an interim measure  one could consider postponing the external debts of developing countries for two or three years  interest-free or at a low rate of interest  and then to hold negotiations between borrower and lender countries in the framework of a conference to find adequate solutions.157.	Regenerating economic growth in the developing countriesâwithout which a lasting and general recovery is not possibleârequires  among other things  a substantial flow of financial resources from the developed countries to the developing countries. This could be achieved  first and foremost  through an annual reduction in military expenditures of from 10 to 15 per cent.158.	The North-South negotiations carried out thus far  including those at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development this year  have not produced significant results. Overcoming the economic crisis and re-launching the growth process in the developing countries urgently require genuine economic dialogue between developed and developing countries.159.	To facilitate this dialogue it would be useful to establish within the United Nations a mechanism open to all Member States for the examination of the major economic problems facing the international community in the fields of raw materials  energy  trade  the external debt of developing countries  and money and finance.160.	In any event  it is necessary to agree on an appropriate negotiating format drawing upon the experience of other complex international negotiations  such as those which took place at the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  and to start urgently negotiations on major economic problems to find generally acceptable solutions which could contribute to the lasting recovery of the world economy  to the elimination of underdevelopment and to the establishment of a new international economic order.161.	Among the items to be considered at this session is that concerning the flow of qualified personnel out of the developing countries. The group of experts convened by UNCTAD  at the initiative of the Group of 77  has begun work and will hold at least two more meetings. We consider that UNCTAD should continue these efforts with the participation of all countries with a view to agreeing upon a set of principles  guidelines and norms concerning the drain of personnel  and upon an integrated programme of action in this field  which could eliminate the harmful consequences of this phenomenon for the developing countries.162.	With the observance of 1985 as International Youth Year  with its motto ""Participation  Development  Peace""  the problems of the younger generation will  with good reason  attract ever increasing attention from States and international public opinion. This should be reflected in the concerns  the debates and the decisions of the present session of the General Assembly.163.	The holding in 1983 of five regional meetings on International Youth Yearâamong them the European meeting  of which Romania had the pleasure of hosting  at Costliestâmarks a new stage in the effective preparation of the Year.164.	The Specific Programme of Measures and Activities to be undertaken prior to and during the International Youth Year  the additional recommendations on its implementation and the reports of the five regional meetings  submitted to the Assembly at this session and set out measures at the national level  as well as action to increase international co-operation in settling specific problems confronting the younger generation today. Moreover  there are a number of other valuable suggestions and proposals put forward by Member States in the General Assembly  in the Advisory Committee for the International Youth Year  in the regional meetings and in other forums which deserve further consideration  with all due attention and in a receptive spirit.165.	It is now for the General Assembly to adopt the decisions necessary to intensify preparations for International Youth Year and to ensure adequate observance of this important event at the world-wide level  under the auspices of the United Nations  as well as to ensure that youth-related issues have a place within the general framework of United Nations concerns which is commensurate with the important role of the younger generation in the world of today and of tomorrow and that those issues are adequately followed up.166.	Life and the realities of today demonstrate that the issue of strengthening the role of the United Nations and of effectively using the potential and the framework of the world body for the settlement of the major problems of humanity has never been so pressing as it is now.167.	At this crucial moment for the whole of mankind  the solution of complex issues of international life increasingly requires the active participation  with full rights  of all States irrespective of social system or size  first and foremost of small and medium-sized countries  the developing and non-aligned countries which represent the huge majority of the peoples of the world.168.	We believe that the time has come to give profound consideration to specific means for ensuring  through the United Nations  the implementation of the fundamental purposes proclaimed by the Charter. We are thinking primarily of proposals to improve United Nations activities substantially  further to democratize its bodies  structures and functions  to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations and to adapt it to the requirements and realities of today's world.169.	We consider it necessary that the terms of reference of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization should be simplified and made more precise  so that that Committee might concentrate on major proposals and submit to the General Assembly specific proposals  adopted by consensus  for improving the effectiveness of the United Nations and its contribution to the maintenance and consolidation of world peace and security.170.	The peoples of the world  deeply concerned over the complex developments in the international situation  look with confidence and hope towards the United Nations and look forward to the results of this session of the General Assembly. It is essential to act even more resolutely to change the course of international events and to adopt a new policy which could ensure for all peoples the fulfilment of their aspirations for a better and more just life and for a policy of peace and international co-operation.17L In this spirit  Romania is carrying out a broad range of international activities  focusing on developing its relations with all socialist countriesâfirst of all with its neighboursâand on expanding its relations with developing countries  non-aligned countries and other States  in the spirit of the principles of peaceful coexistence.172.	I should like to reaffirm the determination of the Romanian delegation to contribute  together with other delegations  to finding practical solutions  solutions which are as effective as possible  to the numerous important issues on the agenda of this session  so that through common effort and in a constructive spirit of co-operation we shall be able to ensure the triumph of reason  of the policy of understanding  detente  security and peace  and of respect for the national independence of all peoples. "
"114",5947,"RUS",38,1983,"ï»¿58.		First of all  allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the important post of President of this session of the General Assembly. Your wealth of experience  including your profound knowledge of the Organization  is an excellent guarantee of the effectiveness of the work of the General Assembly.59.	I should like to take this opportunity to convey our gratitude to our friend and comrade Mr. Imre Hollai  the representative of the fraternal Hungarian People's Republic  for his skilful conduct of the proceedings of the General Assembly last year.60.	We would also like to welcome the entry into the United Nations of a new State  Saint Christopher and Nevis.61.	There are today 158 Member States of the United Nations. It is worth recalling that this reality of the contemporary international scene has quite a definite political meaning.62.	The solution to the crucial problemâthe problem of war and peaceâdepends precisely on the States Members of the United Nations  on the way they construct relations among themselves and on the way they act in the world arena.63.	Under the Charter of the United Nations these States have pledged to ""live together in peace with one another as good neighbours"".64.	If only all of them abided by that Charter provision It would not then be necessary so vehemently to voice the urgent need to defend peace and to dispel the storm clouds gathering over it.65.	That is what the Soviet Union is once again doing today.66.	Our planet is practically caving in under the unprecedented burden of arms with unheard-of destructive power. Should it happen that those arms are actually used  the very survival of human civilization will be in question.67.	The situation is compounded by the fact that the forces heating up the international atmosphere in order to further their pathological ambitions have now sharply intensified their activities.68.	The reckless actions of those forces  combined with the enormous potential of lethal weapons  have produced  figuratively speaking  an explosive mixture which has added an entirely new dimension to the threat to peace.69.	Given the present situation  the task of preventing war has now acquired particular urgency.70.	At a time when all mankind is threatened with a nuclear catastrophe it is the duty of all those who have anything to do with the political decision-making process to put concern for peace above all else.71.	This is what the peoples of the world are entitled to demand of their political leaders  their Governments and parliaments and  of course  international organizations  above all the United Nations  which is designed to be ""a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations"" in maintaining international security.72.	On all continents the people's anti-war movement is growing and its activities in the struggle to preserve peace are increasing. This is only natural  for people cannot and will not live today in a permanent state of anxiety about tomorrow.73.	The course pursued by some Members of the Organization is contrary to the age-old human yearning for a peaceful life embodied in the purposes and principles of the Charter and to the interests of the peace-loving majority of States. The credo of the architects of this course is revealed by the Washington-imposed decisions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization bloc. Their policy is aimed at achieving military superiority  a vantage point from which they wish to dominate and dictate to others.74.	It would appear that the nuclear arsenals of the United States and NATO are filled to capacity  and yet the assembly lines continue to chum out military hardware in a kind of frenzy. Every item of military hardware that exists is being either increased or replaced by another even more destructive.75.	Armaments programmes costing many billions are being approved one after another. Whatever objections are raisedâand they are being raised in this regard by sober-minded politicians and authoritative public figures in the United States itselfâthe United States Administration has but one thing to say: there is not the slightest doubt that we must arm and preferably two or three times over.76.	There have been fierce clashes over deployment of the MX strategic missile and  indeed  as to whether it is necessary at all  but the decision was both to deploy the MX and to develop the Minutemanâyet another intercontinental missile.77.	There were arguments over whether or not to build the B-l bomber. The decision was to go ahead with two new types of strategic bomber  at the same time.78.	Other kinds of nuclear and other systems are also being put into mass production. The barbaric neutron weapon and new chemical weapons are being stockpiled. Next on the list is the development of systems for waging warfare in and from outer space.79.	Under the pretext of an alleged shortage of nuclear weapons in areas where they already exist  attempts are being made to add to them  and where they do not exist  attempts are being made to deploy them.80.	The intention has been expressed to move nuclear weapons as close as possible to the borders of the Soviet Union and its allies  to introduce into Western Europe new American medium-range missiles  that is to say Pershing II and cruise missiles.81.	To the south and to the east the land and waters are also being saturated with nuclear weapons. A11 this is taking place over a wide geographic area  from Diego Garcia to Okinawa  across the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.82.	In order to justify the unchecked escalation of their militaristic preparations they are deliberately whipping up war hysteria and do not stop short of staging the crudest provocations.83.	We  for our part  have already set forth our view  based on principle  of the incident involving the intrusion of the South Korean aircraft into Soviet airspace.84.	It is impermissible for anyone to infringe the sovereignty of States  and this includes the inviolability of their borders. This is a universally recognized rule of international law and is fully consistent with the Charter of the United Nations. Anyone that attempts to violate our borders must know that he will have to bear the full responsibility.85.	We have expressed our regret at the loss of human life. The initiators of this anti-Soviet act of provocation are entirely to blame for this tragedy. No matter what scurrilous slander or dishonest devices they resort to  they will never be able to cover up their tracks and conceal the true aims of their crime.86.	To the impartial observer there cannot and should not be the slightest doubt as to the nature of these aims. An act of sabotage against peace was committed to further militaristic policies and the inflation of military budgets.87.	In an attempt to change in their own favour the military-strategic situation in the world they invoke the security interests of the United States and its allies.88.	It is the right and duty of each country to protect its own security  just as it is its right and duty to work for the strengthening of universal peace.89.	But nowadays international and national security are interrelated to a greater extent than ever before. Neither can be reliably ensured when the United States and NATO are spurring the arms race and pursuing a policy based on a ""position of strength"".90.	Such a policy  however it may be packaged  is the exact opposite of a policy which ensures international security.91.	Certain quarters in the United States have become partial to ringing phrases. Of late a formula that has gained currency at the highest level is ""peace through strength""  which means  of course  the strength of the United States. This has been proclaimed as its policy.92.	In both ancient and modern history there have been quite a few attempts to be the strongest and to rule the world. It is common knowledge how these all ended.93.	Through costly experience mankind has distilled a different notion of what should be the basis of peace and security: the renunciation of the threat or use of force and peaceful co-operation among States. That is what inspired the creation of the United Nations. That is the one and only foundation upon which peace can rest.94.	The myth of the ""Soviet threat""  invented to deceive the peoples  is being used on a particularly wide scale today. In his own time V. I. Lenin aptly characterized those who ""shout about red militarism . . . pretend that they believe this absurdity and throw charges of this kind right and left""  making use of their ""skill in concocting false arguments and in throwing dust in the eyes of the masses"".95.	Since the Great October Revolution peace and friendship among peoples has been the sign of our socialist State. We remain faithful to that sign.96.	There has been a great deal of talk about the USSR being ""excessively armed"" and having military superiority. It has been claimed that the West needs to dose the existing gap. Yet the factsâand the West is just as well aware of them as we areâconfirm beyond doubt that in all areasâstrategic nuclear arms  medium-range weapons in Europe  the conventional armed forces of NATO and of the Warsaw Treatyâthere is approximate equality between the two sides.97.	Statements about national security interests are riddled with falsehoods. They are turned inside-out so that those interests conflict with the security interests of other countries and peoples.98.	Those who like to hold forth about the sanctity of international obligations and to preach morality in relations among States are violating elementary norms of decency  showing disrespect not only for statesmen and States but also for the United Nations. Moreover  as was pointed out in a recent statement by Mr. Andropov  this question as to whether this international Organization  whose task it is to maintain peace and security  can be located in a country in which an unbridled militaristic psychosis is spreading and the good name of the Organization is being insulted.99.	The contenders for the role of master of the destinies of the world brazenly proclaim as a sphere of their vital interests any particular area of the world they take a fancy to  an area perhaps that is even thousands of miles away from the United States. They are prepared to stake such claims all over the globe.100.	Thus  the sphere of the United States ""vital interests"" includes for example  the Middle East  where new anti-Arab deals and designs violating the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are being pushed through. Step by step the United States is forcing its presence  including its military presence  on that region.101.	Israel is being encouraged to continue its policy of aggression. Tel Aviv has absolutely no wish to end its adventure in Lebanon. Palestinian refugees in that country are being subjected to acts of genocide. Lebanon has been forced into accepting a capitulation agreement. Attempts are being made to turn the State of Lebanon into a United States-Israeli protectorate and virtually to dismember that country.102.	Constant pressure is being exerted on Syria to make it change its steadfast course in Middle East affairs.103.	As a result  the Middle East continues to be a focal point of the danger of war  while a peaceful settlement remains out of reach. All this is damaging to both the vital interests of the peoples of the region and the interests of international security.104.	The Soviet Union consistently advocates the elimination of the consequences of the Israeli aggression  supports the legitimate rights of the Arab peoples  including the right of the Arab people of Palestine to establish a State of their own  and advocates a just and comprehensive settlement and the convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation on an equal footing of all the parties concerned  including the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.105.	The hegemonistic policy of ""vital interests"" is well matched by the tools used to implement it. They include the ""central command"" set up to carry out interventionist operations against almost 20 sovereign States in the Middle East  in South-West Asia and on the African continent.	106.	The ""rapid deployment force""  whose mission is to prevent internal changes in various countries if such changes are not to Washington's liking  is in a constant state of readiness. It can be said that the creation of such forces has become a vogue among NATO powers. The events in Chad show where this can lead.107.	What about the extensive worldwide network of United States military bases? They too are being equipped for use against peoples and countries fighting for their freedom and defending their sovereignty. The areas where this struggle is going on are being surveyed for sites for new military bases.108.	Aircraft carriers and battleships are being dispatched to the shores of those who are unwilling to submit to foreign diktat. Modern ""gunboats"" ply the waters off the coasts of many independent countries.109.	Libya has been chosen as a target for a show of force in the Mediterranean.110.	A United States armada is stationed in the Indian Ocean. It is no accident that Washington is opposed to the proposal of the non-aligned countries to turn that region into a zone of peace and is impeding the convening of an international conference on the Indian Ocean.111.	The Soviet Union cannot ignore the threat to its security emanating from that quarter  especially since the United States has broken off and refuses to resume the Soviet-American talks on the limitation and subsequent curtailment of military activities in that region. Our country has been and remains in favour of the withdrawal from that area of all naval forces not belonging to the littoral States and supports the idea of creating a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean.112.	Large United States naval contingents are concentrated off Central American countries  along both the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts. Land and air forces are being concentrated.113.	The purpose of all this must be clear to everyone. The whole policy of the United States serves but one purpose: that of containing the liberation movement of the peoples  to obstruct the process of the strengthening of national independence and democratic change in Latin American countries.114.	At the same time the United States authorities dismiss the very idea that they assume the overt role of policeman. They prefer to call it ""assistance to fiends"". Yet their friends include anti-popular regimes steeped in blood and infamy.115.	They are shielding the military junta in El Salvador from the wrath of the people by supplying it generously with money and weapons. They are sending their military advisers there to supervise repressive operations being carried out by the puppet regime.116.	Brutal pressure is being brought to bear on Nicaragua  whose people have taken a strong stand in favour of the progressive development of their country. Nicaragua is being threatened from the sea  gangs of mercenaries and pirate aircraft are infiltrated into its territory  and neighbouring States are incited to hostility against it.117.	Washington will not succeed in concealing the fact that it is organizing aggression against Nicaragua  thus posing a threat to peace in Central America and exacerbating the international situation in general.118.	No amount of demagoguery about the  'scheming of Moscow and Havana"" will hide the true causes of the growth of the liberation movement in the countries of the region: imperialist oppression and the poverty of the masses. Do they really expect anyone to swallow their bait? Latin America and the world at large are fully aware of the actual state of affairs.119.	Washington does not like the fact that the Cuban people are following the path of socialism they themselves have chosen. Cuba's independent policy and its role in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries go against the grain. Cuba is being subjected to open threats and subversive actions.120.	Interference in the internal affairs of Central American States must be unconditionally stopped. The proposals put forward by Nicaragua and supported by Cuba open up the possibility of easing tensions and bringing about a political solution of the existing problems. The course pursued in particular by Mexico and other countries of the Contadora Group also appears to be positive in that respect.121.	There has been much effort to make things look as if the current aggravation of the international situation dates back to well-known events in Afghanistan.122.	One might assume that even those who were inclined to take that assertion on trust are now beginning to see through its absurdity. The enemies of the Afghan people will not reconcile themselves to the fact that the Afghan people have decided to rid themselves of medieval darkness and have begun building a democratic society.123.	The situation around Afghanistanâand I am stressing the external aspects of the problemâcan be settled on the basis of the proposals made by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  which proposals the Soviet Union fully supports. Military incursions into Afghanistan as well as any outside interference in its affairs  must be stopped.124.	The talks being conducted through the representative of the Secretary-General are of positive significance. They would be more fruitful if the Pakistani side were to display greater political foresight.125.	The policy pursued by outside forces is behind the aggravation of the situation in South-East Asia. That policy is aimed primarily against Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea  whose peoples are defending their independence and are engaged in building a new and peaceful life. There have been persistent attempts to pit against the countries of Indo-China their neighbours  the States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations.126.	The Soviet Union has been and remains on the side of the people of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea. We support the proposals to turn South-East Asia into a zone of peace  good-neighbourliness and co-operation  and we support the initiatives of the three countries of Indo China to open a political dialogue among the States of the region. 127.	Those who are blowing the so-called Kampuchean question out of proportion are not acting in good faith. The people of Kampuchea have chosen the political system for their country and they themselves choose the ones to make friends with and to rely upon.128.	Alarming shifts are taking place in the policy of Japan  whose ruling circles seem to be pleased with the role currently assigned to it as NATO's partner in the Far East. The accelerated militarization of that country adds to tensions in the Far East.129.	This policy can hardly be in the interests of Japan itself and it certainly does not help Japan to develop good relations with neighbouring States.130.	Our country stands for the development of Soviet- Japanese relations on the basis of the principles of good- neighbourliness and cooperation  but of course this presupposes reciprocity.131.	The fact that the Korean question remains unresolved does not enhance the stability of the situation in the Far East. The proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea providing for the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and the creation of the conditions for the reunification of that country by peaceful means  without outside interference  offer a suitable basis for the settlement of this question. The USSR is in sympathy with this position and supports it.132.	With the connivance of Western Powers and in the shelter of their neo-colonialist policies  the racist regime of Pretoria has been making aggressive moves against neighbouring States in southern Africa. These include  primarily  the undeclared war being waged against the People's Republic of Angola. Such criminal acts should be condemned and stopped.133.	The United Nations and the Security Council must bring to bear the weight of their authority in favour of the early decolonization of Namibia  which is still being blocked by South Africa and its protectors. We are confident that the Namibian people will throw off the fetters of colonialism and win freedom and independence for their country  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization their patriotic vanguard.134.	The people of Micronesia  which the United States is unlawfully attempting to hold on to and to convert into a United States military springboard in the western Pacific  are entitled to express their will freely.135.	Britain is pursuing a course aimed at the entrenchment of the colonial status and the militarization of the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands  while refusing to negotiate in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations.136.	A consistently realistic analysis leaves no doubt that the source of the increasingly alarming trends in the international situation resides  as pointed out in a recent statement by Mr. Y. V. Andropov  in the militaristic policy of 6he United States  which is posing a grave threat to peace. The essence of that policy is to try to ensure dominant positions in the world for the United States without taking into account the interests of other States and peoples and to block and reverse the objective process of the world's development.137.	Such a policy is bound to destabilize the world situation still further and to disrupt normal relations among States. Indeed  what guarantee is there that such an adventurist course will not have irreparable consequences?138.	The conclusion that must follow is that practical steps are needed to prevent the worst from happening. The dangerous shift in world developments must be redressed so as to bring about an improvement in international relations.139.	The Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist community are doing everything in their power to achieve that goal.140.	The socialist society  as one which is confident of its creative potential  has no need of an arms race or war. It has demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate its advantages in the process of peaceful competition with capitalism  and it is our conviction that the future belongs to socialism.141.	However  we do not seek to impose our world view on anyone  and we believe that ideological differences should not be allowed to affect relations among States. This is a behest of Lenin  and our country will continue to abide by it.142.	In his statement of 28 September Mr. Andropov said:""The transfer of ideological contradictions to the sphere of inter-state relations has never benefited the one who resorted to it in external affairs. This is simply absurd and inadmissible at present  in the nuclear age. Transformation of the battle of ideas into military confrontation would be too costly for the whole of mankind."" Those forces in the United States and some other NATO countries which shape their foreign policies shrink from nothing in painting a distorted picture of the international situation and laying the responsibility for the exacerbation of that situation at the door of the Soviet Union.143.	Every possible propaganda means has been mobilized to that end. Statements have been pouring forth in torrents from platforms large and small  spewing out uncivilized invective and insults. That technique is used to camouflage their own policy  which is against the interests of the peoples.144.	They will not succeed in casting aspersions on the socialist system and on our civic  social and moral values. No amount of malicious slander can possibly lessen the honest and peaceful policy of the USSR and of the entire socialist community. We and our allies firmly repudiate these calumnies and will give them the response they deserve.145.	The development of friendly relations among States  the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems  strict respect for the right of peoples to independence and social progressâthese are the immutable principles upheld by the socialist countries in their foreign policy.146.	On the basis of a common world outlook and unity of purpose  these States fully co-operate and co-ordinate their policies in the interests of strengthening the foundations of international peace. They are asserting themselves as a powerful factor which has had a positive impact on world events.147.	The countries of the socialist community have made the prevention of nuclear war the centrepiece of their foreign policy.148.	Who among responsible leaders and sober-minded  thinking people in general could fail to agree that this is the most urgent task of our time?149.	There have already been so many speeches made on this subject  here in the United Nations and elsewhere  since the advent of nuclear weapons  but a solution has yet to be found.150.	The degree of progress in limiting and reducing nuclear arms will largely determine the nature of the international situation in the forthcoming period.151.	The present moment is particularly crucial with regard to the situation developing in the matter of the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe.152.	The plans of the United States to deploy  under cover of a NATO decision  new nuclear missiles in some Western European countries have long been poisoning the political atmosphere on that continent and beyond. The implementation of these plans would have an adverse effect on the entire European and international situation and would significantly exacerbate nuclear confrontation.153.	We believe that plans and ideas with regard to what is to be done with nuclear weaponsâboth in their totality and as regards nuclear systems in Europeâshould be reversed.154.	The Soviet Union has supported the most radical solution  that is  that all such nuclear systems  both medium-range and tactical  should be removed from Europe. This would really be the zero option. However  NATO has pointedly made it clear that it is not ready to accept this.155.	We have proposed that the deployment of any new medium-range systems in Europe be cancelled and that all existing systems  both of the USSR and of NATO  be reduced by approximately two thirds; in other words  two thirds of the road towards totally ridding Europe of these weapons would have been covered.156.	Surely  it is quite clear what the Soviet Union is calling for in proposing this far-reaching step  which it is of course understood would not be the last word in the solution of this problem.157.	Why  then  has such a furor been created around the supposed desire of the USSR to gain the advantage in medium-range nuclear systems?158.	Why has it been concealed that the Soviet side is prepared  as has been repeatedly stated at the very highest level  not to have in Europe a single missile  a single aircraft or a single warhead in excess of what NATO countries would have? _159.	Where is the objectivity in this approach? Any politician who claims to be objective is supposed to know at least the basic relevant facts and to make an honest assessment of them.160.	Recently the Soviet Union demonstrated once again its desire to reach agreement. Our initiative envisages that once a mutually acceptable agreement has been reached  including the renunciation by the United States of the deployment of new missiles in Europe  the USSR  while reducing its own medium-range missiles in the European part of our country to a level equal to the number of missiles possessed by Britain and France  would eliminate all the missiles affected by that reduction  including a considerable number of SS-20 missiles.161.	This renders totally groundless allegations that the USSR intends to retain the SS-20 missiles which are affected by the reduction  merely relocating them from Europe to the East.162.	Progress at the talks is being held up by the United States position  which in practice amounts to a demand for unilateral disarmament by the Soviet Union while the arsenals of medium-range nuclear weapons of the NATO countries would remain intact.163.	This position is merely disguised by talk about some flexibility on the part of the United States at the Geneva talks  Another instance of this so-called flexibilityhas just materialized  and the deception contained in it has become clear this time too. Mr. Andropov has stated: ""To leave aside details  the essence of the so-called new move in the United States position  which is billed as 'superb'  boils down to a proposal to agree  as before  on how many Soviet medium-range missiles should be eliminated and how many new American missiles should be deployed in Europe in addition to the nuclear potential already possessed by NATO.""In brief  it is proposed that we talk about how to help the NATO bloc to upset to its own advantage the balance of medium-range nuclear systems in the European zone. And this move is presented brazenly as something new."" 164.	The unacceptability of such an approach is so obvious as to indicate only one thing: a persistent reluctance on the part of our negotiating partners to search for a solution based on equality and equal security and their intention to station their missiles on European soil at any cost.165.	Whether or not agreement is to be reached depends on the United States and on NATO as a whole. The current round of Soviet-American talks on the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe is crucial in this sense.166.	If Washington's position remains so unconstructive  if Washington goes so far as actually to deploy new United States missiles in Europe  then we of course will have to take countermeasures to preserve the balance of forces on both a European and a global scale.167.	It is to be hoped that Washington and other NATO capitals will ponder again and again the existing situation and the grave consequences which would result from another twist in the arms race.168.	The Soviet Union and the Warsaw Treaty States do not seek military superiority  but they will not allow anyone to acquire military superiority over them. They have invariably advocated equality  and equality at the lowest possible level.169.	The USSR proposals in the negotiations on the limitation and reduction of strategic arms are also based on the same approach. They call for  among other measures  a substantial reductionâa reduction by more than a quarterâof the total number of strategic delivery vehicles with a concurrent reduction to agreed equal limits of the aggregate number of nuclear weapons carried by these delivery vehicles. Our proposals arise from an interest in strengthening overall military strategic stability while strictly observing the principle of equality and equal security.170.	In the negotiations on the limitation of reduction of strategic weapons the United States has taken a one-sided approach. The position of the Washington Administration is actually aimed at promoting  rather than halting  the strategic arms race in areas where the United States sees advantages for itself.171.	The fatal consequences of a nuclear war are not to be regarded as fictional conjectures. Its flames would not spare a single country or people.172.	This is the unanimous view of the most eminent scholars and competent military and civilian experts.173.	There is and can be no justification for any actions that push the world towards the abyss  or for doctrines and designs based on the admissibility of a nuclear war and the possibility of winning it.174.	Guided by these considerations  the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of an important and urgent item entitled ""Condemnation of nuclear war"". 177. Such war must be condemned resolutely  unconditionally and for all time as the most hideous of crimes that can be committed against the peoples. We propose that States Members of the United Nations declare as criminal acts the formulation  promotion  dissemination and propagating of political and military doctrines and concepts designed to substantiate the ""legitimacy"" of the first use of nuclear weapons and in general the admissibility of unleashing nuclear war.178. The USSR is submitting a draft declaration on this point to the Assembly for its consideration. Its adoption would contribute to generating a political climate which would make more difficult the actions of those who are devising plans calling for the first use of nuclear weapons.179. The approval of this declaration  following the Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear Catastrophe adopted in 1981 on the initiative of the Soviet Union  would be a major move by the United Nations towards removing that threat.180- The condemnation of nuclear war should be effectively backed up by practical steps to curb the nuclear arms race.181.	In this context a freeze on nuclear weapons by all States which possess them would be an extremely timely and truly tangible measure. The idea of such a freeze has been winning ever-increasing support in the world  in both nuclear and non-nuclear countries.182.	Our country proposed some time ago  in the course of negotiations on the limitation and reduction of strategic arms and on the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe  that both strategic weapons and medium-range weapons in Europe be immediately frozen for the duration of the negotiations.183.	Now the Soviet Union is submitting an urgent and important question entitled ""Nuclear arms freeze"" to this session of the General Assembly for its consideration.184.	Our proposal is for a cessation  under effective verification  of the build-up of all components of nuclear arsenals  including all kinds of delivery vehicles and weapons  a renunciation of the deployment of new kinds and types of such weapons  the establishment of a moratorium on all tests of nuclear weapons and of new kinds and types of delivery vehicles  and a halt in the production of fissionable materials for the purpose of creating arms.185.	A simultaneous quantitative and qualitative freeze on nuclear weapons by all nuclear Powers is the best way to achieve this goal. Our country is prepared to agree that initially this be done by the USSR and the United States on a bilateral basis as an example to other nuclear States.186.	Giving practical effect to this initiative would markedly raise the degree of trust among the nuclear- weapon countries and would make it possible to move decisively towards breaking the vicious circle of the arms race. This would also promote the reduction and  eventually  the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.187.	We express the hope that States Members of the United Nations  above all the other nuclear Powers  will take a responsible and constructive stand on our proposal and will support it.188.	The Soviet proposal entitled ""Conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the use of force in outer space and from outer space against Earth"" submitted to the current session for consideration  has been prompted by concern for preventing the militarization of outer space  an issue which is becoming extremely important.189.	Positive action on this initiative  which is a follow- up to our 1981 proposal made here at the United Nations for a treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space  would be in keeping with the urgent task of ensuring peaceful  and exclusively peaceful  use of outer space in the interest of and for the benefit of all people.190.	Specifically  the idea is to have a comprehensive ban on the testing and deployment of any space-based weapons designed to destroy targets on Earth  in the air or in outer space.191.	At the same time  provision is made for the complete renunciation of the development of new anti-satellite systems and the elimination of existing systems. If it would be of any help  we are also prepared to conduct separate talks on anti-satellite systems  including talks with the United States on a bilateral basis.192.	The obligation assumed by the USSR not to be the first to place any kind of anti-satellite weapons in outer space is yet a further manifestation of its desire to see the problem of such weapons solved in a radical way. This unilateral moratorium declared by our country is to last for as long as other States  in particular the United States  refrain from placing anti-satellite weapons of any kind in outer space.193.	The initiatives we are taking at this session are a logical extension of our foreign policy  based as it is on principle  and of the convincing peace-oriented proposals that the Soviet Union has been putting forward in recent years.194.	Among the many other steps taken by the Soviet Union in the key areas of international life  I would like to single out the following.195.	There is the obligation by the USSR not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. If such an obligation were assumed by all the nuclear Powers  this in practice would be tantamount to a prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. Our appeal for this remains in force.196.	There is also the proposal for a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. This is consistent with the task of preventing the possibility of developing new kinds of nuclear weapons and of strengthening the non-proliferation regime. The Committee on Disarmament should as a matter of priority take measures with a view to producing the draft of such a treaty.197.	Furthermore  there are proposals for banning neutron weapons as well as for preparing an international convention on the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons.198.	These and other Soviet initiatives aimed at limiting the arms race and bringing about disarmament deserve the most serious attention.199.	I would like to make special mention of the joint proposal of the socialist countries for a treaty on the mutual non-use of military force and the maintenance of peaceful relations between the States of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic alliance. The obligation not to use weapons of any kindânuclear or conventionalâthat is to say  not to use force at all  would help to dispel mutual fear and distrust. The initiative is gaining increasing prominence in European and world politics.200.	It has always been our view that the problem of security on the European continent should be treated with particular circumspection. It is precisely here in Europe that the two militarily most powerful groupings of States âthe Warsaw Treaty and NATOâare facing each other. 201.	In view of all this  not a single move in Europe leading to the easing of tensions and the positive development of relations among States could be redundant or superfluous.202.	It is time to break the deadlock in the talks on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe  where the level of military confrontation is particularly high. The draft agreement submitted at Vienna by the socialist countries creates real conditions for narrowing the gap between the positions and for reaching agreement.203.	The Conference on Confidence- and Security- building Measures and Disarmament in Europe scheduled for next January at Stockholm will play an important role in enhancing European and international security. The USSR  to the extent it can  will seek to ensure that the work of the Conference is fruitful and lives up to the expectations placed in it by political circles and broad sectors of public opinion in European and other countries.204.	The Soviet Union attaches great importance to preserving and expanding its diverse ties with the countries of Western Europe. We intend to continue to maintain relations with them along the lines traced by the. Helsinki Final Act in a spirit of trust and co-operation.205.	The successful conclusion of the Madrid meeting of representatives of States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is quite rightly viewed as an indication that the policy of detente  which has been so beneficial for all the peoples of Europe  has a great deal of vitality.206.	Even though there has been a coolness in relations in the current international situation  this proves that despite considerable divergences in their policies  States with different social systems are capable of solving together problems that are not at all easy to solve  and of searching for and finding areas of agreement.207.	We would like to believe that appropriate conclusions will be drawn from this  and not only as regards Europe and relations among European States.208.	This November marks the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The whole history of Soviet-American relations makes it abundantly clear that whenever these two States have followed a course of mutual understanding and co-operation  their peoples as well as universal peace and security have gained thereby.209.	It has been our invariable view that the maintenance of normal stable relations between the Soviet Union and the United States is in their mutual interest  and we are in favour of their overall improvement and peaceful co-operation.210.	It is not through any choice of ours that Soviet- American relations are currently marked by tensions which also affect the international situation.211.	Today  the urgency of the problem of preventing the threat of war requires that each State be fully aware of the degree of its responsibility and to reaffirm  both in word and in deed  its commitment to the policy of peace. The Soviet Union is in favour of combining our efforts on the broadest possible basis in order to achieve this noble goal.212.	In the service of peace there is room for action by every country  regardless of its social system  its level of economic development  its size or its geographic location.213.	Such an important State as the People's Republic of China can do a great deal to ease international tension and eliminate the danger of nuclear war.214.	The Soviet Union is ready for a political dialogue with China on questions of bilateral relations  as well as on central problems connected with strengthening peace and international security. The positive development of Soviet-Chinese relations  which should be constructed with due account being taken of and mutual respect for the interests of each side and  naturally  without detriment to third countries  would benefit our two peoples and promote a better political climate in the world arena.215.	We welcome the growing activity of the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America in defending international peace. They need lasting peace to solve the difficult problems of their national and social development.216.	The results of the non-aligned forum held this year at New Delhi have once again demonstrated the anti-war and anti-imperialist orientation of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries.217.	The policy of peace of India  the current Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement  enjoys well-deserved prestige. The Soviet Union and India are linked by bonds of friendship and close co-operation which are highly valued by both sides.218.	The Soviet Union pursues a course of principle with regard to the elimination of all manifestations of inequality and exploitation  the building of confidence in economic ties between States and the establishment of just international economic relations.219.	The peoples of developing States have a real awareness of the magnitude and nature of our assistance in helping them to overcome their economic backwardness. In this area the Soviet Union is doing more than any developed capitalist country.220.	The Soviet Union supports the demand for the early launching  within the United Nations  of ""global negotiations"" on major economic problems  as envisaged in decisions of the General Assembly  and also the idea of the convening  within the framework of the United Nations  of an international conference on these subjects.221.	We have been and we remain sympathetic to the developing countries which are striving to do away with the tyranny of monopoly capital and free themselves from neo-colonialist exploitation.222.	Our country is firmly on the side of those who  to this very day  are fighting for their freedom and independence  those who are being forced to repel the aggressor or being threatened with aggression. This stand is inseparable from our struggle for lasting peace on Earth.223.	In the present alarming international situation there is also need for the mobilization of the entire impressive potential of the United Nations as an instrument for maintaining international security. The Soviet Union has supported and will continue to support consistently and resolutely United Nations efforts to remove the threat of nuclear war  curb the arms race  eliminate the existing hotbeds of international tension and prevent the emergence of new ones and to develop relations of peace and co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.224.	No matter how complicated the situation  real possibilities exist for overcoming the difficulties of this period in international relations. Mr. Andropov stressed in his statement of 28 September:""The Soviet leadership does not hesitate about which line to follow in international affairs in the present critical situation . . . Our course remains aimed at preserving and strengthening peace  lessening tension  curbing the arms race and expanding and deepening co-operation between States. This is the unfailing will of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  of all Soviet people. These are  we are convinced also the aspirations of all peoples.""225.	We appeal to all States to draw sensible conclusions in the existing situation  conclusions that are in keeping with the most profound aspirations of the peoples  and above all to exert efforts urgently to solve the problem common to all mankind  that of eliminating the risk of nuclear war.226.	People must feel secure about their future. "
"115",5994,"RWA",38,1983,"ï»¿40.	The thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly is meeting at a time when the international situation hardly affords any grounds for optimism. In a world which is in the grip of a persistent economic crisis  peace continues to be seriously threatened by numerous sources of tension and even by overt conflict.41.	It would  in fact  be unrealistic and illusory to proclaim that since the thirty-seventh session the international community has made any significant and substantial progress towards achieving the objectives stated in the Charter of the United Nations. The advent of a world of peace and security for all peoples  unfortunately  still remains a pious hope  despite the laudable efforts made by the Organization  efforts which have been taken up and supported by all countries which cherish peace  freedom  justice and equality and which are anxious to promote active solidarity among peoples.42.	Economically  the international situation is in a continuing state of stagnation  with a crisis which has been transformed into recession and which has been further aggravated by monetary fluctuations  galloping inflation  unemployment  trends toward protectionism  deterioration in the terms of trade and the pressing burden of external indebtedness for the developing countries  not to forget food shortages which afflict certain parts of the world  haunted as they are by the spectre of hunger  poverty and even total deprivation.43.	Against the background of this international economic crisis  the socio-economic situation and prospects are particularly gloomy for the least developed among the developing countries.44.	Politically  the international community is suffering from the anxieties created by the dangers which continue to threaten world peace and security because of growing tensions and the fact that various parts of the world are caught up in endless conflicts.45.	It is in the light of all this  Mr. President  that it will be your task to direct the work of the Assembly whichâand this is the hope of the delegation of Rwanda âat its present session will help further to promote the objectives which the United Nations has set for itself. While emphasizing my delegation's willingness and wholehearted desire to co-operate for this purpose  like those who have spoken before me I should like to convey to you our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the present session  an event which is both evidence and a solemn tributeâevidence of the confidence placed in you  and a tribute to your outstanding qualities and your competence and to the active part which your country has always played in the Organization.46.	May I also pay tribute to Mr. Imre Hollai  the President of the thirty-seventh session  who discharged his responsibilities with praiseworthy skill and judgment  thus further enhancing the prestige which his country already enjoys in the comity of nations.47.	May I reiterate to the Secretary-General the deep gratitude which the Government and the people of Rwanda feel for his constant efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations as an instrument to promote peace and solidarity among nations.48.	I should also like to take this happy occasion to welcome to the Organization the newly independent State of Saint Christopher and Nevis. Its admission as the 158th Member demonstrates the Organization's universality and brings us even closer to one of its fundamental goals  which is the liberation of peoples suffering under the colonial yoke.49.	As we do every year  we have come together here at the Headquarters of the United Nations to evaluate what has been done since the last session in the search for appropriate solutions to the problems of major concern to the international community  in both socio-economic affairs and political affairs.50.	At the very outset I would like to express the very warm and sincere thanks of the Government and the people of Rwanda to all those partners  friendly countries and international bodies which have supported the Rwandese Republic in its development efforts. Their support is particularly appreciated since it has had a positive impact by improving the living conditions of the people of Rwanda and at the same time has made a concrete contribution to promoting the ideal of solidarity and interdependence  which the international community sorely needs.51.	Turning to the economic situation of the world  the present situation is such that the gap between the rich and poor countries unfortunately continues to grow. This negative development goes hand in hand with a number of difficulties that make the socio-economic prospects of developing countries particularly gloomy. their balance- of-payments deficit continues to grow and their growth rates have slowed down  while official development assistance continues to stagnate at a level well below the 0.7 per cent target of gross national product set by the United Nations.52.	There is little need to recall that such difficulties are not mere transitory phenomena but  rather  symptoms of profound structural imbalances. These imbalances require fundamental reforms that will make it possible to avert the danger of the world economy's being at the mercy of events and plunging the poor countries into an inextricable situation and making their efforts at development pathetically inadequate.53.	It is essential to promote solidarity and effective interdependence within the framework of international co-operation. This need was already quite plain in 1974  when the international community proclaimed its desire to restructure international economic relations by launching the idea of a new international economic order to be given final form through global negotiations.54.	Nearly 10 years of painstaking efforts towards that end have now elapsed without any significant results. Indeed  it must be recognized that the North-South dialogue is deadlocked. Even the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  produced only very limited and meagre results  although in the eyes of the third world it ought to have been the high point of that year in terms of the North-South dialogue.55.	None of the specific steps intended to promote the economic recovery of the developing countries was announced id/the context of the financial transfers that would make such a recovery possible and avoid any exacerbation of the crisis for countries heavily dependent on external markets and on their raw materials  the prices for which are constantly falling. No decision was reached with regard to compensatory financing to offset the reduction in export earnings.56.	In this context the developing countries  and in particular the least developed countries  continue to feel that they are the poor relations in the North-South negotiations  because those who hold the whip hand have made no substantial concessions.57.	International solidarity must be shown to a greater degree in the form of increased financial assistance. The transfer of capital and technology from rich to poor countries should be considerably increased  both in volume and in quality  to meet the ever-growing needs.58.	It is in everybody's interest that rich and poor alike realize that only through solidarity can the continuing development of the industrialized countries and the effective economic growth of the poor countries be assured. It is the rarest wish of the Rwandese Republic that the international community should act in such a spirit of solidarity to establish fairer and more balanced economic relations  for it attaches great value and importance to the willingness to define and concretize a constructive policy to that end.59.	Rwanda also hopes that such willingness would lead in a very short time to the new international economic order that the peoples represented in the Organization so keenly desire. Rwanda  since it is directly involved  also hopes that special attention can be paid to the least developed countries  particularly those that are land-locked. In addition to the difficulties they are facing as a result of the general world crisis  such countries have to overcome the very specific problems created by their special situation.60.	It was in this context that the Government of Rwanda welcomed with enthusiasm the convening in Paris in September 1981 of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. Although the recommendations and resolutions adopted by that Conference gave us a glimmer of hope that the special socio-economic conditions of that category of countries would be improved  we are forced to acknowledge today that the encouraging statements made at that time have not yet been followed by specific action.61.	The Government of Rwanda thus remains convinced that international economic and trade relations should be put on new bases. My delegation hopes that at this session the General Assembly will at least make it possible to reach some agreement that will help to revive global negotiations in the framework of the North-South dialogue.62.	The operation of the Common Fund for Commodities  the creation of which was welcomed as a significant gesture in the context of that dialogue  is today at a standstill for lack of adequate financing. The necessary arrangements should be made to ensure that commodity and raw material prices are both guaranteed and remunerative  contrary to the present trend  which is for them to be kept artificially low  while at the same time the prices of exports from the industrialized countries continue to rise  thereby causing a constant deterioration in the terms of trade to the detriment of the poor countries.63.	Rwanda believes that in the efforts to ensure the establishment of a new international economic order it is essential to promote the effective solidarity of the industrialized countries with the third world  that within the framework of that solidarity the goal of devoting 0.7 per cent of the gross national product to development assistance should constitute a commitment to be honoured without further delay.64.	Rwanda also believes that it is essential to develop and strengthen horizontal co-operation among developing countries. It was with that particularly in mind that the Rwandese Republic endorsed the recommendations contained in the Lagos Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Monrovia Strategy for the Economic Development of Africa  adopted in 1980 by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  and that it actively supports the goals of the regional and subregional organizations to which it belongs  while at the same time maintaining bilateral relations of co-operation with various other third world countries.65.	At the thirty-seventh session the delegation of Rwanda welcomed the adoption in April 1982 by a majority of States Members of the Organization of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. My delegation would now like to reiterate its appreciation of the tireless and concerted efforts that led to the final consensus document. The Rwandese Republic  which is pleased to be among those countries that adopted and signed it  hopes that the provisions dealing with land-locked countries will receive the necessary attention and consideration  particularly with regard to rights of transit.66.	At the beginning of my statement I said that in the present political context peace is not resting on as sound a foundation as the international community would like. Sporadic crises  tension and constant conflicts disturb the peace in various parts of the world. The initial enthusiasm for the policy of detente appears now to have dampened. The prospects are particularly gloomy because the impact of the crises that have taken place goes well beyond the regions directly affected and  at another level  the disarmament negotiations are moving at a snail's pace.67.	In southern Africa the persistence of apartheid a wicked and odious system based on a racist policy  and the illegal occupation of Namibia as well as the constant attacks by South Africa against its neighbours are all matters that gravely endanger peace in that region  where a continuing explosive situation hampers the promotion of international security. When will the racist minority Pretoria regime finally heed the voice of reason and stop exploiting and oppressing an entire people that is only fighting for recognition of its most elementary and fundamental rights?68.	Deaf to the numerous appeals by the international community  the South African Government is typically becoming increasingly arrogant in the face of the legitimate claims of a whole population that has risen up against its policy based on dyed-in-the-wool racist principles.69.	The same arrogance can be observed in its policy towards Namibia  where  playing for time and constantly resorting to delaying tactics  South Africa continues its illegal occupation while  at the same time  systematically obstructing any initiatives to secure the self-determination of the Namibian people through constructive dialogue and in acceptable conditions.70.	Although it was 17 years ago that the General Assembly decided to put an end to South Africa's Mandate over Namibia	Pretoria continues to ignore that decision. Although the United Nations is actively involved in seeking a negotiated solution to the Namibian question  and although the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] has made considerable concessions to that end  the South African Government has upped the ante  demanding new conditions and imposing supplemental clauses before Security Council resolution 435 (1978) can be implemented. The aim of all this  although it is not admitted  is to restrict the real impact of an authentically free electoral process in Namibia. The negative  arrogant and intransigent attitude of South Africa has disgusted all those nations which  cherishing peace  freedom and justice  are convinced that the Namibian people is entitled to self- determination and independence in a united Namibia.71.	The Government of Rwanda believes that the plan drawn up by the United Nations is the only proper context for the settlement of the Namibian question. This plan must be swiftly implemented  without any modifications that would in any way restrict its scope. The attempt to introduce into it elements extraneous to the Namibian questionâfor example  making the independence of Namibia dependent upon considerations that are nothing more or less than flagrant and outright interference in matters involving the sovereignty of another countryâ is a manoeuvre designed to delay pointlessly the outcome of a historically inevitable process.72.	The countries which originally advocated the United Nations plan for Namibia should give more effective support to the initiatives to put an end to the merciless oppression afflicting the Namibian people  which the racist minority South African regime keeps in the fetters of an anachronistic colonialism.73.	The delegation of the Rwandese Republic wishes to express again its unflagging support for the Namibian people  which  under the leadership of SWAPO  its sole authentic representative  is exercising its right to self- defence in order to regain its dignity and win its rights to self-determination and independence.74.	The front-line countries  particularly Angola  Botswana  Lesotho and Mozambique  enjoy the same support from us. South Africa is constantly blackmailing those countries by the use of brute force through its constant attacks and acts of sabotage  which have created an atmosphere of unrelieved tension throughout southern Africa.75.	Rwanda pays tribute to those countries for the self- sacrifice and determination they have displayed to ensure that legitimate aspirations based on the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations may triumph in this test started by the racist minority regime that rules in Pretoria. In this trial of strength the morality for which the freedom fighters are willing to lay down their lives will finally usher in a new eraâan era of peace and stability  which the countries of southern Africa so direly need.76.	Still on the subject of Africa  another people is attempting to secure its right to self-determination. I am referring to the Saharan people  which has been struggling since November 1975  militarily  politically and diplomatically  to achieve recognition of that right. My delegation hopes that the parties to the conflict  Morocco and POLISARIO  will waste no time in getting down to negotiations  resolutely and in good faith  in accordance with the recommendations put forward by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity during its nineteenth session  held last June at Addis Ababa. Deeply wedded as we are to the universal principle of the right of all peoples to self- determination  the Rwandese Republic ardently hopes that this fratricidal conflict will be rapidly settled in that spirit  so that peace can be restored to that region and the Maghreb peoples can give a concrete example of their solidarity and their brotherhood in the struggle for social and economic progress.77.	For some 20 years now  an African country  Chad  has been devastated by a fratricidal conflict whose fluctuations have been of constant concern to the OAU and the United Nations. The perpetuation of this conflict is a heavy burden on the development of that country  which is using up its strength on internecine struggles  whereas it needs the contributions of all its sons and daughters to carry out the reconstruction and rehabilitation of its economy  devastated by so many years of warfare.78.	This work of reconstruction and rehabilitation is really a wager that the entire Chadian people has to win if its future is to be safeguarded. This presupposes that the Chadians will overcome the differences which maintain and foster the struggles for influence and the sterile quarrels. This presupposes also that they will engage in dialogue and reconciliation  which they have been encouraged to do by all those countries that respect the sovereignty of every State and are faithful to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes.79.	In that spirit  the Government of Rwanda associates itself with the repeated appeals to the protagonists in the Chadian tragedy to demonstrate a spirit of pragmatism and tolerance and to work out a political solution that would recreate the dynamic unity of Chad and put an end to the trials imposed on an entire people  which has paid such a high price for the dissension that has divided its vital forces and threatened its country with total disintegration.80.	In the Horn of Africa  the tension which was extremely high and disturbing a few years ago has now been somewhat reduced  and this should make it possible for the parties involved actively to seek ways and means likely to promote the complete restoration of a climate of peace to that region. In this connection respect for the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of States  respect for the territorial integrity of States and the peaceful settlement of disputes should make possible a compromise solution.81.	For some 30 years now the Middle East has been a hotbed of tension beset by constant crisis and tragic events which have as their background the martyrdom imposed on the Palestinian people and the fundamentally negative and dangerous policy pursued by the State of Israel against the Arab countries. That State  of which the least that can be said is that it has not learnt much from its own history  has defied the decisions of the United Nations and paid little heed to the precepts of international law. Thus Israel obstinately refuses to recognize the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine; it has flouted the sovereignty of Lebanon  annexed Arab territories and increased the number of its settlements thereon. Its unavowed design is to exterminate the Palestinian people in a fight to the finish.82.	Israel will not  however  by deploying its heavy war machinery replace international morality and ethics by brute force. It will not succeed in repressing the spirit and indeed the heroism that have prompted the valiant Palestinian people to struggle for the recognition of their rights  with the support of all countries that cherish peace and justice. It is not by intolerable harassment  torture  expulsion  intimidation  blackmail and every kind of atrocity or by an arrogant and intransigent attitude that the State of Israel will find peace. Peace is conditional upon recognition of and respect for the fundamental and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  in particular the right to self-determination and the right to a homeland in which to establish the governmental structures of their choice. There can be no peace in the Middle East without a just and comprehensive settlement that takes full account of the rights of the Palestinian people and without the restoration of all Arab territories occupied by force by Israel.83.	In this respect the necessary arrangements should be made to put into practice the principles contained in the Geneva Declaration on Palestine and Programme of Action for the Achievement of Palestinian Rights adopted by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held from 29 August to 7 September 1983 at Geneva   under the auspices of the United Nations. It should be recalled that in the Programme of Action laid down by that Conference it is recommended that at the present session the General Assembly should designate a  Year of Palestine  in order to make international public opinion aware of the problems of that people.84.	The Geneva declaration on Palestine advocates  inter alia the convening of an international conference under United Nations auspices to work out a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict. The PLO should be able to participate in that conference on an equal footing with the other parties involved in the conflict  and the solution proposed should take into account the inalienable and fundamental rights of the Palestinian people.85.	The PLO  which has b a recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  has set itself the goal of winning  cognition of and respect for their rights. In the struggle e it is waging for that purpose  the PLO will always be able to rely on the support of the Rwandese Republic  which believes that such support is a moral duty incumbent on all countries that cherish peace and justice.86.	The State of Israel is obstinately pursuing an unacceptable policy  despite the relevant decisions of the United Nations. Thus Lebanon  a country which has become the constant whipping-boy of Israel  is the scene of perpetual crises  and its territorial integrity and sovereignty are continuously threatened  the Government of Israel having  it would seem  set itself the goal of placing Lebanon under its tutelage. The United Nations would lose some of its credibility were it to remain impotent in the face of this situation  which gravely compromises any initiative to bring peace to an area very sensitive for international security. It is high time for the diaspora imposed on the Palestinian people to end; it is high time for the policy of terror and apartheid which the Israeli Government has persistently imposed on the Middle East  with an arrogance that the international community has constantly denounced  to be terminated.87.	In the same region  the war pitting Iraq against Iran has been going on for four years now  with a growing list of human victims and material damage. The Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries have sent frequent mediation missions to the two belligerents without succeeding in inducing them to enter into a cease-fire or persuading them to reach a settlement by peaceful means. Each of the two parties has had a number of opportunities to put forward its point of view and explain its position concerning the circumstances at the root of this fratricidal conflict.88.	Rwanda  which like other States Members of the United Nations is deeply concerned at the persistence of this war that is sapping the strength and energies of two brother peoples  continues to hope that Iraq and Iran will allow themselves to be convinced of the need to find the path of harmony  rather than wallow in hatred and destruction  and that they will appreciate the true value of the honour that attaches to those that pursue peace  solidarity and interdependence. The delegation of Rwanda wishes to associate itself once again with all those who for four years now have been urgently demanding that these two countries united by the same Islamic faith and the common ideal of non-alignment put an end to a conflict that has lasted too long by accepting a mutually agreed arbitration likely to promote the settlement of their dispute.89.	At the end of 1979 a crisis exacerbated international tension  dealing a rude blow to the policy of detente. Since then  the situation which has crystallized in Afghanistan has made the struggles for influence worse  thus constituting a serious threat to international peace and security. Although the majority of Member States has clearly advocated the total and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from that country so that the Afghan people can settle their domestic issues in full sovereignty  that crisis persists.90.	In South-East Asia  the tragedy which the people of Kampuchea have suffered for almost five years is also continuing  against the backdrop of foreign interference which may well touch off the entire region.91.	Rwanda believes that in the case of both the Afghan crisis and the question of Kampuchea the solution is to be found in respect for the sovereignty of States and non-interference in the internal affairs of others and that it must be sought on the basis of the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes.92.	At each session of the General Assembly the delegation of Rwanda recalls the problem of divided nations  while at the same time expressing its conviction that it is for the peoples directly concerned to seek the ways and means of regaining their unity  free from any outside interference or pressure. In this spirit  the Rwandese Republic believes that it is through open and constructive dialogue in an atmosphere of understanding and trust that the Korean nation will be able to secure the reunification of its homeland  for which a prime prerequisite is the absence of any outside interference.93.	The Government of Rwanda believes that the spirit which at present informs relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic is likely to promote a continuing dialogue and co-operation that will make it possible to attenuate the effects of the division of the German nation and may even lead eventually to its reunification.94.	Rwanda believes in the need to create a more tranquil climate in the international community  so that all peoples can devote more of their time and effort to promoting development. For that reason  initiatives to encourage detente must not exclude the third world  because the tensions which arise there often encourage external interference and struggles for influence.95.	At every session discussions in the Assembly reflect the misgivings and uncertainties of Member States about the future of mankind  in view of the uncertain prospects resulting from the continuing economic crisis and the persistence of various conflicts and tensions. With the spiralling arms race and the stockpiling of increasingly sophisticated weaponry  mankind is now living under the threat of a deadly new holocaust which in the present context is no mere flight of fancy.96.	In the opinion of the Government of Rwanda detente  if genuine  positive and effective  has two meanings: it will represent greater security so necessary for harmonious development  and it will be a factor that will help to bring peoples closer together and permit a more active solidarity.97.	At a time when the world economy is in complete disarray and when the developing countries are becoming poorer with each passing day  one of the major causes of the growing gap between the third world and the industrialized countries is the fact that immense resources and potential are devoted to the creation of nuclear arsenals and the production of new weapons of mass destruction. Disarmament is a fundamental factor in the search for appropriate solutions to the problems involved in establishing more harmonious relations in the international community  relations based on the freedom and sovereignty of peoples within a framework of co-operation and solidarity. If security is to be promoted  it must start with dialogue  and in this spirit the major Powers should put an end to the arms race  embark with determination on disarmament efforts and encourage effective use of technology for peaceful purposes so as to promote development for the benefit of all mankind and to reduce the poverty which is the daily lot of most of the world's population.98.	Two special sessions of the General Assembly have been devoted to disarmament. It is now time for specific steps to be taken in order to frame a peace strategy and reverse the present trend towards escalating the arms race  in which immense financial  material and scientific resources are squandered  and which at the same time involves a grave risk that the entire human race may be exterminated.99.	I have briefly touched upon the major problems which the international community is facing at the present time. All these are challenges which the Organization should help to meet.100.	In the economic sphere  the North-South dialogue seems to have reached a deadlock. The global negotiations have become bogged down in procedural wrangles. The situation of the developing countries is worsening  while the sums devoted each year to armaments have exceeded the alarming figure of $600 billion and more than 1 billion persons are living below the poverty line  with an income of less than $150 a year. How can we allow such a scandalous paradox to continue? The international community must meet the challenge of development by creating a new international economic order.101.	In the political sphere  it must be recalled that although a conflict may be confined to a single geographical area  it nearly always has international repercussions. It is a threat to peace  it disrupts international relations  it looms large in everyday events and gives rise to conflicting interpretations  it is necessarily a factor of division. This is true of the crisis which is tearing the Middle East apart and of the hotbeds of tension or open conflicts in Africa  Asia and Latin America  as well as the conflicts imposed on peoples which quite legitimately are seeking to promote  safeguard or strengthen their independence.102.	In the light of all those acts of hostility and continuing confrontations  international organizations remain impotent and paralysed and are unable to guarantee the peace and security that the world so sorely needs. What can be done? Should we sink into despair? No  we must not give up or indulge in excessive pessimism. Let us remember that  during its 38 years of existence  the Organization  through the tireless and concerted efforts of its Member States  has been able to achieve enough to justify continuing along this path which leads to the noble aims which guided its creation. The United Nations must continue by its actions to promote confidence and hope in the future of the world  to strengthen interdependence  complementarity  co-operation  dialogue and trust among peoples.103.	It is in this spirit that the Rwandese Republic  at this great annual gathering of international diplomacy  intends to participate actively in the work of the present session and to spare no effort in helping to promote the aims set forth in the Charter  so that we can achieve the international order whose image that document holds up to all peoples of the world  in an atmosphere of equality  complementarity and solidarity  and increased peace and justice."
"116",6039,"SAU",38,1983,"ï»¿102.	  It gives me great pleasure  Mr. President  to begin my statement by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your election to that responsible office is an expression of the esteem of the international community both for you personally and for the prominent position of your country among the nations of the world.103.	I also wish to join those of my colleagues who have preceded me in expressing admiration and gratitude to Mr. Imre Hollai  President of the thirty-seventh session  for the skill with which he conducted its proceedings.104.	Our appreciation goes also to the Secretary-General  who has to carry out his heavy responsibilities in the difficult circumstances now confronting the countries and peoples of the world. The wisdom  foresight and objectivity with which he conducts United Nations affairs deserve our respect and support. We wish him all success.105.	I also wish to join the heads of other delegations in welcoming Saint Christopher and Nevis as a new Member of the United Nations  now to participate with the other Member States in achieving the noble objectives of the Organization.106.	The General Assembly is reconvening this year in the shadow of an international community still burdened with conflicts  turmoil and intrigues  of an international situation still characterized by tension and anxiety  of political problems still awaiting solutions and of economic crises which are choking the countries of the world.107.	We come here every year to the General Assembly to face this long list of issues  problems and tensions  like someone searching for the light at the end of the tunnel. We seek ways and means of finding common ground in confronting these problems. We make pledges and promises to protect the independence of our countries  to refrain from interfering in each others' affairs and to respect the sovereignty of each State and its right to choose freely the form of government it desires. We fervently endeavour to adhere to the lofty purposes and principles which form the basis of the Organization.108.	Fortunately the keen interest we sensed on the part of world leaders this year in participating in the deliberations of the General Assembly and their statements about the need to deal seriously with the problems under consideration and to adhere to the Charter of the Organization are all an indication of the value attached by States and peoples to the important role of the United Nations.109.	As Members of the Organization  we are all pledged to adhere to the Charter and to be in earnest in implementing its provisions. The super-Powers bear a special responsibility in this regard. The fact that they are superpowers possessing considerable resources of power and means of defence and influence given them no special rights. Power does not confer rights; rather  it imposes duties and responsibilities.110.	It is the duty of those Powers to establish the basis for just and efficient international co-operation and to protect the interests and independence of small States  rather than dividing them into spheres of influence. History provides ample proof that a division of the world into spheres of influence among conflicting forces leads  in the final analysis  to the outbreak of world wars  with the resulting catastrophes and destruction.111.	All this confirms that world peace cannot prevail and international relations cannot be established unless the contemporary international political order is based on the principles of right  equality  justice and the rule of lawâall of which constitutes a complete and indivisible framework.112.	The Islamic world  through the Organization of the Islamic Conference; the Arab world  through the League of Arab States; and  from within those two groups  the group comprising the States of the Gulf Co-operation Council  have played and continue to play constructive roles in strengthening and developing cooperation among the States members of those organizations  in accordance with the basic rules which brought them together and unified them  and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  international laws and practice and the principles of right and justice. These organizations strive for prosperity and progress among their member States  thereby fulfilling the purposes of the United Nations and reaffirming the principles of its Charter.113.	We hope that the Secretary-General of the United Nations will intensify his efforts to ensure co-operation with the Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Secretary-General of the Arab League  in accordance with General Assembly resolutions that have recommended increased co-operation among them  in the interest of international co-operation and world stability.114.	His Majesty King Fahd Ibn Abdul Aziz has confirmed the Kingdom's keen desire to lend its full cooperation at the international level  within the United Nations and its organizations and agencies  and to abide by the Charter of the United Nations  supporting its endeavours and combating any attempts to weaken it and reduce the rule of law  as happens when attempts are made to replace it by the force of arms and by terrorism.115.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has anchored its dealings with other States on solid grounds. These grounds are: the principle of national sovereignty  absolute rejection of any attempts to tamper with that sovereignty  and dealing with others on the basis of equality and refraining from any intervention in their internal affairs.116.	While my country supports all the efforts of the United Nations to reduce tension and conflict in various areas of the world  it condemns all attempts at external covert or overt intervention that can threaten the security and stability of other States. In this connection  we should learn from past experience and realize that these external adventures will backfire and in the end have adverse effects for those engaging in them.117.	It is regrettable that there should be a deep gulf  a wide gap  between the commitment to the principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the actual conduct of international relations. This has rendered more frequent the resort to force  violence and military superiority in settling disputes  instead of adhering to the principle of legitimacy and searching for concepts of right and justice. This regrettable development has led to a loss of prestige for the international Organization  which is a reflection of the hopes of mankind for a society where security  peace  justice and the rule of law prevail. 119. This dangerous situation makes it necessary  indeed urgent  for all the members of the international community to consider serious and responsible measures to reaffirm the commitment to the original principles of the Organization and to strengthen its lofty aims and objectives.120   The United Nations has adopted dozens of resolutions relating to Israel's naked aggression against the people of Palestine  including resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly since 11 December 1948 providing that the Palestine refugees should be permitted to return to their homes if they choose to do so and that compensation should be paid to those choosing not to return. Resolution 194 (III) has been followed by dozens of resolutions on the same line  but Israel has refused to implement any of them. Israel has also refused to implement the resolutions confirming the rights and legitimate interests of the Palestinians living in the territories occupied by Israel. In this regard  a cause for concern is the extent of Israel's defiance of these resolutions  which has led the United Nations to reaffirm its past resolutions by adopting new ones every time the Palestine question comes up for discussion.121.	This dangerous defiance has a negative effect on the credibility of the United Nations itself; the prestige of the international Organization  which embodies the hopes and aspirations of peoples and nations for peace  will be severely shaken if it contents itself with adopting resolutions and recommendations. The viability of the United Nations as a reliable and effective safety-valve for maintaining peace and security in the world and establishing the basis of justice in international co-operation depends to a great extent on its ability to assume its role  not merely by adopting resolutions but also by ensuring their implementation.122.	The United Nations has repeatedly stressed the necessity of safeguarding the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and has in its resolutions condemned Israel for its role as an aggressor and its occupation of Arab lands. But the result has been that the Zionist entity has not moved one inch away from its policy of aggression. There can be no better example of that than the naked Israeli military occupation of Lebanon and the resulting deterioration of the conditions in the area.123.	In that way Israel has given conclusive proof that it does not wish to listen to the unanimous calls of the international community. After all this  we must ask: Does the United Nations have any alternative to proceeding from the level of condemnation to the level of tangible measures that would put an end to this aggression  which violates all international obligations  principles and laws?124.	That question is put to the United Nations. If it wishes to regain its credibility  its resolutions must be taken seriously. That cannot be done if the resolutions are not implemented.125.	The continued denial by Israel and those who support it of the right of the Palestinian people to live in freedom  security and peace in its own country will result in catastrophe for those who created the problem.It is also necessary to warn against the dangerous measures that the Zionist entity has taken and continues to take in Al-Quds  which is recognized as a Holy City by more than 1 billion Moslems all over the world. Foremost among these measures are those taken to judaize the Holy City and to change its features  as well as the excavations under the Masjid Al-Aqsa and the adjacent demolitions  which are likely to undermine its structure. If the won J wakes up one morning to the news that the Masjid Al- Aqsa has been damaged or completely destroyed  the violent reactions by the Islamic world will have dangerous effects  effects that will not be confined to the security and stability of the area but that will extend far and wide.126.	The dangerous developments and repercussions arising from the events in the Middle East crises  added to the inhuman practices of the Zionist entity in Al-Quds and the rest of the occupied territoriesâin particular  the persistence in establishing settlementsâprovide most impressive proof of the futility of the hope of establishing a just and lasting peace in the area as long as Israel plans aggression and expansion and as long as the international community does not respond to those plans with more than resolutions of rejection  condemnation and denouncement. On our part  we  as Arabs  have established that we advocate peace  and we continue to reiterate our desire for peaceâpeace based on justice and not peace imposed by force and subjugation.127.	The Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez  confirmed the firm Arab approach to peace based on justice  peace that guarantees the security and safety of all the States in the region  including the Palestinian State  and secures the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Those rights include the right of return and self-determination and the establishment of its own State on its own land. Such a peace cannot be established without the participation of the Palestinian people through its sole and legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization.128.	This approach has recently been endorsed in the texts adopted at the International Conference on the Question of Palestine held at Geneva  which affirmed the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the establishment of security and peace. These texts appeal to the international community to end military  economic and political aid to Israel in order to prevent its continued aggression.129 As in past years  the General Assembly has before it this year for consideration and for the adoption of positions and resolutions a long list of problems involving Zionist aggression and crime.130.	We hope the international community will demonstrate its objectivity and its determination to require each Member State to enforce its resolutions or suffer the sanctions stipulated in the Charter.131.	We demand of the great Powers  to which the Zionist entity owes its creation and continued existenceâ and we demand of the United States of America in particular  which bestows upon Israel considerable means of power and a great portion of its means of livelihoodâ that they take action to deter Israel  since the danger has now grown to an extent that poses a threat to the security and stability not only of the region: but of the world at large.132.	The problem of Lebanon today is the result of continued and recurring Zionist aggression. Israel's aggression and invasion of Lebanon under the eyes of the international community has stirred up internal conflicts nourished by Israel  thus creating further complications. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  in co-operation withLebanon and with sister States and friends  is doing its utmost to prevent a further complication of the problem and to protect Lebanon's integrity  freedom and independence and to secure the resumption of normal life.133.	At a time when the Arabs prove to the whole world their good intentions  their movement towards peace and their keen interest in establishing the principles of legitimacy and respect for the international will  Israel gives one proof after another of its aggressive intentions  its expansionist objectives and its designs to pervade the region with chaos  instability  disturbance and dissension.134.	While the Arabs have offered to the world irrefutable proof of their desire for a just and comprehensive peaceânamely  the Arab peace planâIsrael has added to its chain of aggressive actions a new link which involves horror  violence and threats to security and stability on a scale not less than its previous actions. I refer to its brazen military invasion of Lebanon and horrible massacres that resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent children  women and elderly persons  a deterioration of conditions in Lebanon and a threat to security and peace in the region. Israel's aim was to abort all peace efforts and initiatives. Action in furtherance of that aim included its categorical and immediate rejection even of President Reagan's initiative  while the Arab States endeavoured  particularly through the Committee of Seven emanating from the Fez Summit Conference  to benefit from positive aspects of that initiative.135.	This happened at the very time when the intensive efforts of the Arabs to stop the fighting in Lebanon and to begin a national dialogue between the various Lebanese factions  as a prelude to the return of stability  national unity and full sovereignty  proved the Arabs' capability and determination to engage seriously in the issues of peace  while the continued Israeli military presence in Lebanon  the continued naked Israeli attempts to stir up dissension and  problems between the various Lebanese communities  and Israel's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs provide further proof of its evil intent and its aggressive objectives and purposes.136.	By its repeated attacks on Lebanon and its flagrant military invasion of that country  Israel intended to make Lebanon a feather in the wind  to make it unable to stand on its own feet or to make its voice heard  with no cause to occupy it except fighting  internal strife and the loss of life and property. Hut the courageous Lebanese people has proved its resilience and ability to rise to the challenge  even under the harshest and gloomiest conditions. An agreement has been reached on a cease-fire and on the initiation of a national dialogue in order to reach agreement and find a fundamental solution to the problem  based on respect for Lebanon's sovereignty  territorial integrity  political independence  Arab character  the unity of the people and Government  and the protection of the rights of everyone in the country on the basis of equality  respect  coexistence and co-operation.137.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  which made intensive efforts to achieve a cease-fire agreement and to begin a national dialogue between the Lebanese parties  hopes that the positive spirit which led to that agreement will grow deeper and firmer. At the same time  the Kingdom believes that the Israeli presence in Lebanonâan aggressive military presence resulting from an invasion by forceâwill remain the major cause of setbacks and deterioration in the situation. The Israeli perspective of the situation in Lebanonâor  rather  in the whole Middle East regionâemanates from dangerous racist and expansionist attitudes and relies on arrogance of power and a desire to dominate. Therefore  the ending of Israeli intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon and the full and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Lebanese territories are prerequisites for the return of normal conditions to Lebanon and for dedicating all efforts once more towards establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.138.	The war between the two neighbouring Muslim States  Iraq and Iran  has entered its fourth year  and it still inflicts on the two countries the highest price in lives and potential. There is no justification for its continuance  and there will be no victor  regardless of the outcome.139.	Iraq has demonstrated its complete readiness to forget the past  to stop the fighting and to preserve the lives of the Iraqi and Iranian peoples. It accepted the mediation of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations and the various international and bilateral endeavours  the latest of which was the endeavour by the States of the Gulf Co-operation Council  which we hope will be successful.140.	The application of the principles of our Islamic religion  accepted by the international community  requires that both Iraq and Iran stop the fighting and resort to reason to settle their dispute. The great Powers and the Security Council also bear a special responsibility in this regard.141.	We hope that Iran will respond to the call for peace and proceed in that direction.142.	The fierce war in Afghanistan  where for three years and nine months the Afghan mujahidin have engaged in a war of liberation against the Soviet military invasion  sets the greatest example of sacrifice and struggle.143.	This war also represents another face of aggression  that perpetrated by a super-Power against a State which to that very moment had had friendly relations with it and had maintained good-neighbourly relations with it for many years. That State was rewarded by invasion. We salute the Afghan	and we fully support the demand of the Afghan people for the withdrawal of foreign troops from its territory and the establishment of a system of government acceptable to it that would maintain its neutrality and preserve its beliefs and faith. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has fulfilled its responsibilities within the framework of the intensive efforts of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eliminate the means of the oppression and occupation suffered by the Afghan people in order to enable it to act freely and to assure its right to freedom  independence and the exercise of sovereignty in its own land  and to draw attention to the gravity of the Soviet armed invasion of Afghanistan and the need to stand firm against that aggression. That aggression constitutes a serious precedent that is not limited to violating the sovereignty of the Afghan people and depriving it of its right to self-determination and to choose the system of government acceptable to it  but extends to breeding instability in the region and threatening international peace and security 144.	We reiterate our appeal to the Soviet Union  as a super-Power sharing the responsibility for international peace  to set an example by withdrawing from Afghanistan and leaving the country to its people  so that it may recover the status of neutrality and live at peace with all its neighbours.145.	We also hope that the Soviet Union will appreciate the high moral and political price it must pay for its continued occupation of Afghanistan and its war against the Afghan people. The entire Moslem world and all nations that cherish freedom and peace support the rights of the Afghan people and demand that the Soviet Union withdraw from its land.146. I wish to reiterate my country's thanks to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the generous assistance it extends to the Afghan refugees and emigrants  at the expense of Pakistan's economy and potential. The number of refugees in Pakistan exceeds 3.5 million.147. The policy of racial discrimination pursued by the Government of South Africa is an ugly feature of the civilization of the twentieth century. South Africa stands with its Zionist ally in Palestine and partner in the manufacture of nuclear weapons and the exchange of terrorist expertise before the eyes of the world  with the aim of threatening the security of small States and terrorizing them. Each of them ties its fate to the other. Each of them is doomed to failure unless it recognizes reality and follows the path of justice.148.	We reiterate our condemnation of the racial policies of South Africa and its evil alliance with the Zionist entity in Palestine. We demand of the countries of the world that they take the position that corresponds with their international responsibilities and the principles which form the basis of the Charter of the United Nations. We also support the right of the Namibian people to independence.149.	The General Assembly  at its second special session devoted to disarmament  convened last year  emphasized the dangers faced by mankind because of the problem of armaments. The non-nuclear States expressed the desire to protect themselves against the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons  to prevent the testing of nuclear weapons  to ensure the cessation of the manufacture of chemical weapons and the destruction of arsenals of such weapons  and to establish zones of peace and nuclear- free zones in the Middle East  Africa  South-East Asia and other regions of the world.150.	We see how  nevertheless  the Zionist entity in Israel persists in the use of internationally banned weapons. The world has recently seen tens of thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese  most of them children  women and the elderly  falling victim to cluster and concussion bombs used by Israel during its aggressive invasion of Lebanon.151.	The United Nations could solve the problem of ending the arming of Israel  South Africa and other countries with weapons of mass destruction  particularly as this falls outside the realm of the extremely complex issues of international disarmament.152.	In the last few years the world has faced an economic situation characterized by continued economic recession  a deterioration in the terms of international trade  increased rates of unemployment even in the industrialized countries  a sharp fluctuation in the balance of foreign trade and payments  the increased recurrence of protectionism in the industrialized countries  and the adoption by these countries of a bilateral approach to solve their international economic problems. Naturally  the impact of these conditions on developing countries has been extremely serious and this has impeded then- developmental efforts.153.	These developments proved the nature and importance of interdependence and illustrated the fact that no country cam live in isolation from the rest of the world or shield itself from the economic problems confronting the world. They also showed the impossibility of any country or group of countries undertaking alone responsibility for resolving world economic problems. They have consequently confirmed the necessity and priority of broad international co-operation in dealing with international economic problems.154.	The increased tendency towards protectionism among the industrial countries represents a regrettable approach which world experience has proved to be futile and destructive to international trade. Consequently  a continuance of this tendency threatens the entire world with a return to the tragic and painful experiences of the 1930s.155.	We therefore call upon the industrial countries to repeal the protectionist measures adopted by them and to reaffirm their commitment to the system of free international trade. We call upon them to deal with economic and trade problems through existing international channels and in accordance with recognized international agreements and treaties.156.	It was natural that the international monetary system should face considerable difficulties as a result of the serious world economic developments in the past few years. We are convinced that although this system had demonstrated its ability to face difficult international conditions  it had also demonstrated the necessity and urgency of reforms which would enable it to respond more flexibly to the international economic and political changes that had taken place since its inception and to take better into account the development needs of developing countries.157.	It is evident that there is an organic interrelationship between the issues of trade  commodities  finance and development that calls for an integrated and comprehensive approach to these issues. It is truly regrettable that the repeated attempts to activate international economic co-operation and to launch a new round of comprehensive economic negotiations have not as yet borne fruit. However  we still since we believe in the importance of these negotiations and in the necessity of overcoming all procedural barriers to their initiation.158.	The developing countries have reiterated time and again their true desire for sincere co-operation in the interest of the welfare of the international community and have shown a considerable degree of flexibility and a definite tendency to pragmatism and objectivity in their approach to international economic co-operation for development. That tendency was particularly demonstrated in the resolutions adopted by the Seventh Conference of the Heads of State or Government of the Non Aligned Countries and in the Buenos Aires Platform adopted by the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 779  is regrettable that this positive spirit among the developing countries has not yet received a proper response from the industrial countries. Thus a golden opportunity for co-operation was missed at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.159.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has demonstrated its strong support for the efforts to develop and strengthen economic co-operation among the developing countries and for the strategy of collective self-reliance. I should like to reiterate from this rostrum our continued support for such efforts  which we consider an essential complement to the efforts to strengthen international economic co-operation.160.	I am convinced that the difficulties which hinder our efforts to activate international economic co-operation and to establish an international economic system based on justice must under no circumstances be a cause for despair. On the contrary  they should prompt us to continue our efforts tirelessly and relentlessly.161.	The tools of death and destruction possessed by the super-Powers have reached such a degree of perfection and precision that they could easily and instantly annihilate our civilization. Consequently  it rests with all of us to exert earnest and continuous efforts to prevent the resort to those weapons of mass destruction and to support world peace by every possible means. If that imminent danger and the tremendous balance of terror between the nuclear Powers  particularly the United States and the Soviet Union  is a deterrent to the transformation of crises into full-scale destructive wars  then such a preventive deterrent provides no certain guarantee for peace. There can be no guarantee except by initiating a process of disarmament  by destroying those lethal weapons and abandoning their production. That alone will not suffice. Nothing will be achieved unless there is a fundamental change in present attitudes  a relinquishment by the Powers monopolizing weaponry of their greed  an endeavour by every nation on Earth to choose co-operation and harmony in preference to feuds and conflicts  and the creation of a suitable environment wherein mutual trust can prevail.162.	Force may sometimes succeed in solving certain problems  but such success remains vulnerable. It will never reach the roots of problems. In the last analysis  those who seek fundamental solutions to their problems must acquire the necessary moral capability.163.	Peaceful coexistence between peoples is not just a political slogan or an economic necessity. It is a pressing need for humanity to achieve its goals of progress  prosperity and abundance.164.	As is rightly written in the Koran  ""As for the foam  it disappears like scum upon the banks  while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the Earth"". The All-Powerful God spoke the truth. "
"117",6076,"SDN",38,1983,"ï»¿31.	 Allow me at the outset  Mr. President  to extendto you our sincere congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Through you  we extend to the Government and people of Panama our congratulations on your assumption of this high office. My delegation is fully aware of your personal contribution as an able statesman and experienced diplomat to the activities of the United Nations system  and we are sure that your wisdom and ability will enable you to guide our deliberations successfully.32.	We also take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General. We are confident that the lucid report he submitted to this session on ways of enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations and its various organs will be discussed with vigor and seriousness during the debate.33.	I wish also to express our gratitude to Mr. Imre Hollai  who presided over the thirty-seventh session with distinction.34.	We welcome warmly to the United Nations the State of Saint Christopher and Nevis. We are confident that its contribution will enrich the work and activities of the Organization and foster efforts towards international peace.35.	As we meet in yet another session  we must pause to assess our achievements and failures in the face of the great challenges and major issues that have confronted the international community during the past few years. We hope that this exercise will prove beneficial in our current deliberations.36.	It is clear that this session is taking place at a time when the international situation is very complex and in a climate characterized by numerous hotbeds of tension  war  instability  mutual mistrust  foreign intervention in the affairs of others and the use of force. All this lessens the chances of peaceful coexistence and constructive co-operation between all countries and peoples  irrespective of their differing political and socio-economic systems.37.	One of the dangers facing our world is the acceleration of the arms race and the ever-increasing risk of nuclear war. Expenditure on nuclear and conventional armaments amounts to the astronomical figure of $800 billion annually. It would be more appropriate to channel this sum towards efforts to ensure development  international economic co-operation and peace among nations. We regret to note that the goal of arms control is still beyond reach. On the contrary  the production of more precise and destructive nuclear and chemical weapons increases steadily. Moreover  the scope of the arms race has been extended to include outer space  jeopardizing the very existence of mankind and civilization.38.	In the face of these imminent dangers  my country once again states its conviction that international peace and security can be guaranteed only by implementing a system of collective security and only if the Security Council effectively shoulders its responsibilities  in accordance with the Charter. It is also necessary to ensure comprehensive disarmament  especially nuclear disarmament  under effective international control. Specific measures should also be taken immediately  to ensure adherence to a ban on the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in any circumstances  and to conclude a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  coupled with specific safeguards by the nuclear Powers to ensure the security of non-nuclear States. The Sudan reaffirms its conviction that both Africa and the Middle East should remain zones free from nuclear weapons. We support all efforts aimed at transforming the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  and in that connection we hope that the Conference on the Indian Ocean  which has already been postponed several times  will be convened in the near future.39.	Although I have dwelled on the gloomy aspects of the current international situation  I must not neglect some positive developments that have taken place this year  in particular the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which was held at New Delhi last March. That Conference  which is the largest forum of heads of State or Government  placed emphasis on the serious threats now facing international peace and security. The New Delhi message reaffirmed the positive role that the Non-Aligned Movement plays in fostering international stability and in the establishment of a new international economic order.40.	We have also witnessed the reinvigoration of the Organization of African Unity through the convening of its nineteenth Assembly of Heads of State and Government last June at Addis Ababa after a two-year impasse. The holding of that Assembly was in itself an affirmation of the role of that important regional body in solving African disputes and therefore in strengthening the efforts of the international community for the maintenance of peace  security and international cooperation.41.	There is no need to emphasize the real threats posed by the situation in the Middle East to the peace and security not only of the peoples of the region but of the world at large. In the absence of a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian problem  which is at the core of the Middle East question  the situation has continued to deteriorate. Israel has continued its occupation of Arab territories and persisted in changing their identity  repressing their populations and denying the Palestinian people its natural and legitimate rights as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and affirmed in the various resolutions adopted since the birth of the Organization.42.	At the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez  the Arab States reaffirmed their commitment to peaceful solutions based on justice for all countries and peoples of the region. They thus offered a historic opportunity to ensure peace in one of the world's most sensitive and important regions. Regrettably  Israel elected to reject peace  continuing its disregard of all peace initiatives.43.	The international community has declared on many occasions and in various forumsâmost recently at the International Conference on the Question of Palestine held last summer at Genevaâthat a peaceful and lasting solution of the Middle East question cannot be attained without total and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem  and the exercise by the Palestinian people  under the leadership of their sole legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  of their legitimate and inalienable rights  including their right to the establishment of their own independent State. These conditions remain the solid basis for a peace based on justice  and not imposed by the force of arms.44.	Continued Israeli defiance of the will of the international community will lead to a new confrontation unless Israel is compelled  especially by its friends  to implement the resolutions of the General Assembly and he Security Council and to put an end to its aggressionand its occupation and annexation of the lands of others force of arms. The question of Palestine and the Saddle East will remain the acid test of the credibility of the Organization  which represents the aspirations of all nations to peace and security based on law  justice and respect for the legitimate rights of others.45.	Israel's designs have extended to Lebanon. That sister country was subjected to brutal Israeli aggression  which aggravated the problems of the region and constituted an attempt to destroy the unique social and political fabric of that country. In this connection we demand the unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in accordance with Security Council resolutions  which would permit the restoration of Lebanon's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  without any external interference. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to commend the recent efforts which culminated in a cease-fire agreement. We hope this agreement will be followed by the implementation of effective measures to ensure the maintenance of peace and stability.46.	The serious situation in southern Africa  perpetuated by the racist regime in Pretoria  has continued to arouse anxiety and concern in all countries and peoples around the world. The racist authorities have persisted in their policy of apartheid  a policy that has on many occasions been condemned by the international community as a crime against humanity  most recently at the Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  held last August at Geneva.47.	The Government and people of the Sudan condemn the South African regime's apartheid policies practiced against the majority of the population of South Africa  its aggression against neighbouring African States and its determination to maintain apartheid by force  including nuclear force. The Democratic Republic of the Sudan further warns against the racist regime's manoeuvres and its policy of so-called gradual change  granting limited constitutional rights to the ""Coloured"" population. Sudan will continue its unequivocal support for the freedom fighters in South Africa until freedom  equality and independence are achieved.48.	In Namibia  racist South Africa is still obstructing implementation of the peace plan endorsed by Security Council resolution 435 (1978). That regime's objective is to prolong its occupation of the region and its exploitation of its natural resources  in complete disregard of the will of the international community  which continues to see the Namibian question as one of its most important concerns.49.	The international community has followed with great attention recent developments relating to the question of Namibia  including the consultations held recently between the Secretary-General and parties concerned  in accordance with Security Council resolution 532 (1983) of last May. We appreciate that effort  and following its completion we deem it necessary that the Security Council commence the implementation of the peace plan according to an agreed timetable which would be binding on South Africa and which would not involve extraneous issues such as linkage of the independence of Namibia with the presence of Cuban troops in Angola. Independence is one of Namibia's basic legitimate rights and it should not be subject to conditions or compromises. It is a right that calls for urgent international action to exert pressure on the Government of South Africa to enable the Namibian people to exercise its right to self-determination under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SHK4PO]  its sole legitimate representative.50.	One of the African questions that are a source of concern to us is the question of Chad. The Sudan has followed the development of events in fraternal Chad with much anxiety  because of the close links that exist between our two peoples and the inevitable impact on us of whatever takes place in Chad. Since the Sudan has adopted the policy of good-neighborliness and non-intervention in the affairs of others as a cardinal principle of its foreign policy  it is only natural that we have been greatly concerned over the aggression against Chad  an aggression that violates that principle and threatens the sovereignty and independence of a Member State of this Organization.51.	The international community followed closely the deliberations in the Security Council on Chad's complaint of attempts to overthrow and replace a legitimate Government that is recognized by the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement and the OAU. It is truly regrettable that the Security Council  which is entrusted with the maintenance of international peace and security  was not able to discharge its responsibilities despite the fact that the aggression against Chad was a flagrant violation of the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of that country. That failure not only undermines the credibility of the Security Council  but also arouses the fears of many countries that do not possess the necessary power to deter foreign aggression. It will also encourage similar adventures unless a deterrent is found to preserve the independence  unity and territorial integrity of weaker countries.52.	The Sudan supports the efforts of the OAU to assist the Government of Chad  whose legitimacy was confirmed at the nineteenth session of the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government. We hope that  with the support of the OAU and of the international community  the legitimate Government of Chad will be able to settle its internal problems without any foreign intervention and to direct its efforts to problems of reconstruction.53.	With regard to the question of Western Sahara  we hope that the climate of reconciliation in North Africa will lead to the re-establishment of stability and security in that region and to the settlement of the issue through a referendum among the Saharan people. This would certainly bring about a peaceful and lasting settlement that would avoid bloodshed and improve relations among the States of that region.54.	The people and Government of the Sudan still follow with the utmost sadness and concern the more than three-year-old war between Iraq and Iran  a war that has defied all the international attempts to halt it and to resolve peacefully the conflict between the two neighbouring Moslem countries. It is regrettable that several Iraqi initiatives intended to halt the war have not elicited a positive response from Iran. Hoping that United Nations and other efforts will succeed in halting the war and peacefully settling the conflict  we call again on Iran to accept those peace initiatives in order to end the war  so that the human and material resources of the two countries may be utilized for the benefit of their peoples and of humanity at large.55.	The Sudan firmly believes that international conflicts should be settled peacefully through dialogue and negotiation  and without resorting to the use of force or aggression. As a result of this conviction  we have called for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and Kampuchea  to enable those peoples to enjoy then- basic and inalienable rights to liberty and self-determination. We have also called for a peaceful settlement of the conflict between North and South Korea and between the two communities in Cyprus  through dialogue and in accordance with the wishes and aspirations of their peoples  without any foreign intervention.56.	In Central America and the Caribbean we hope that current efforts  particularly those of the Contadora Group  will culminate in a successful  peaceful settlement enabling the countries of that region to realize the aspirations of their peoples to progress and prosperity.57.	As we review developments in the international economic sphere over the past year  we cannot help but feel more disappointment as we witness the passing of yet another year during which the international community was unable to deal with the serious threat to all countries posed by the devastating international economic crisis. Our disappointment is aggravated by two factors. First  the expected economic recovery  which alone was supposed to be sufficient to resolve international economic problems in general  and the problems of the developing countries in particular  did not prove capable of doing so. Secondly  although last year there was a serious effort on the part of the developing countries  at the New Delhi summit meeting and at the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  at Buenos Aires  to express their perception of the crisis and to propose clear  realistic and flexible ways of resolving it  the response of the developed countries  as reflected in the results of the Summit of Industrialized Nations  held at Williamsburg  and at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade  did not match the genuine and praiseworthy efforts of the developing countries  at a time when the international community fully realized the depth and seriousness of the economic crisis and the threat it poses to the prosperity of all nations and recognized that the developing countries in general and the least developed in particular  are more vulnerable to the impact of the crisis and less capable of withstanding its devastating effects and making the necessary adjustments to cushion them. We had hoped that international recognition of the seriousness of the crisis would provide a sufficient impetus to evolve ways of defusing the crisis through an independent and co-operative international effort addressing all aspects of that crisis  in other words  through the global negotiations proposed a few years ago by the developing countries and accepted by the developed countries  but nevertheless not yet launched.58.	The Sudan  like other developing countries  and the least developed in particular  suffers the negative impact of the devastating international economic crisis. To mitigate the effects of the crisis the Sudan adopted  on the one hand  the strategy of self-reliance and  on the other  the policy of bilateral  regional and international economic co-operation.59.	In evolving the strategy of self-reliance  the Sudan endeavours to utilize local capabilities and resources to implement its economic and social development plans and to broaden the base of political and economic participation through the adoption of decentralization and regional government. In the context of economic and technical co-operation among developing countries  the Sudan endeavours to strengthen bilateral and regional relations through joint ministerial commissions  regional and interregional groupings within the Lagos Plan of Action^ and the Caracas Programme of Action/ The best example in this context is the programme of integration between the Sudanese and Egyptian peoples  crowned recently by the adoption of an integration charter between these two brotherly countries  which represents a firm and promising step towards wider regional co-operation open to the countries of the Arab and African regions  as well as to all developing countries.60.	Besides the negative effects of the international economic crisis  the Sudan  like some other African countries  suffers the heavy burden of the incessant and increasing influx of refugees  swallowing up a large portion of local resources and efforts. The Sudan managed  through its own efforts and with the assistance of friendly nations and governmental and non-governmental organizations  to provide assistance to refugees in its territory as a humanitarian and moral duty. But we still believe that a permanent solution to the refugee problem can only be achieved through voluntary repatriation and mainly through treatment of the political and other root causes of the problem  as highlighted by the Secretary- General in his annual report to this session of the Assembly. Until such a lasting solution to the refugee problem is achieved  we hope international support to host countries  particularly in Africa  will continue. In this respect  we also hope that international participation in the forthcoming Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  scheduled to be held in the near future  will be commensurate with the needs of African refugees and host countries.61.	The urgent issues that abound in the agenda of this session  the international climate in which it is taking place  and the attendance of a large number of heads of State or Government give a special distinction to it. This should  therefore  be a timely occasion for the international community to renew its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations in deeds  not words  and to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations and its organs  particularly the Security Council. only then can we achieve international peace and security and promote international co-operation in other fields.62.	In conclusion  let us hope that this sessionâthrough the fruitful results that can be achievedâwill be a landmark in the history of international endeavours."
"118",6122,"SEN",38,1983,"ï»¿197.	 In electing Mr. Jorge Illueca President of the thirty-eighth session  the General Assembly has paid a tribute to his country  Panama  and to him as a skilful diplomat. My country  Senegal  would like to congratulate him warmly. We are sure that he will conduct the session's business efficiently and competently  with objectivity and dedication. My delegation takes this opportunity of assuring him of its co-operation throughout this session in his delicate task.198.	My country congratulates Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission to the Organization.199.	I should also like to congratulate Mr. Illueca's predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  President of the thirty- seventh session  most sincerely once again on the wise and able way he guided our work from September 1982.1 wish to thank him at the same time for having been so kind as to come to Geneva to take part in the final stage of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  over which it was my country's great honour to preside from 29 August to 7 September E983.200.	Finally  my delegation would like to reiterate its congratulations again to the Secretary-General for the efforts he consistently makes on the five continents  continually devoting himself to the cause of peace and to the defence of the universal values of solidarity and friendship among the nations. These thanks are also extended to our colleagues and to all the staff of the Secretariat  including the interpretation service  with whose dynamism and dedication we are all familiar and which we very much appreciate.201.	In a world where only too often self-interest takes precedence over generosity  violence over dialogue  the effectiveness of an organization such as the United Nations must not be assessed or measured in mathematical terms. Today the international community faces many serious conflicts throughout the world. To put an end to them we lack neither a proper legal basis  as constituted by the procedures for settling international disputes and the resolutions and appeals of the Organization for peace and understanding  nor the reiterated sincere and unequivocal expressions of willingness to rally peoples to the ideals which unite them.01. However  we must note that national  regional and ideological self-interest  cultural complexes  short-term concerns linked to incomplete or fragmentary events unfortunately continue to divide the world.202.	Given such a situation  which must in no way discourage us  the United Nations is still and must remain the indispensable framework for privileged meetings  of which the annual session of the General Assembly is a living symbol. The United Nations  with its universal character  must continue to offer small countries the only adequate forum for making the world aware of their often ignored legitimate concerns. The establishment within the United Nations system of many specialized agencies must enable large and small countries  in a great upsurge of solidarity and mutual confidence  to open every area of international co-operation to the attainment of the important objectives embodied in the Charter of the United Nations since 1946.203.	The action of the United Nations has already enabled mankind to build  on the ashes of the Second World War  the basic tenets of a new society  a society which is still imperfect but of which we must never despair. Industrial and developing nations alike  we must build  despite the many obstacles on the path  a future of progress  a future of justice.204.	For all these reasons  the United Nations deserves our support  and the ideal it symbolizes today calls for our clear and consistent commitment.205.	My country  Senegal  and its leader  President Abdou Diouf  sincerely reaffirm here and now  through me  their faith in the Organization and their steadfast adherence to its objectives.206.	Within this framework  the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries  that great gathering of the nations of the third world  in order to stress their support for the many efforts of the United Nations  proposed  at the seventh summit conference  held at New Delhi in March 1983  that the year 1985 be declared United Nations Year 207.	Our concern  given the present state of the world  does not derive only from the existence of crises  because in a world that is changingâand the world has never before changed as fast as it is todayâcrises are inevitable. Besides  they are not always the sign of a new evil; they may denote the acute stage of a long-standing evil which we were not able to remedy in time. Our concern can be explained rather by our inability to resolve crises or find appropriate solutions to the fundamental problems of peace and development.208.	Our concern is all the more justifiable in thatâas was pointed out during the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization by President Abdou Diouf  then Prime Minister of Senegal  speaking from this rostrum on 19 October 1970 during the twenty-fifth session:""this inability to solve these problems is not of an intellectual nature but rather of a moral nature.""â And these problems remain.â""What is lacking is the true will to solve these problems ... a true political determination based on the moral courage to take the true decisions that our intelligence is perfectly capable of conceiving.""209.	In fact  the framework for and even the ways and means of finding appropriate practical solutions to many problems have been set forth in the Charter and even in the resolutions which we adopt each year. But in political practice self-interest takes precedence over generosity and ultimately little effort is made to prevent or combat the many violations of human rights or the rights of people.210.	In this light  the problems of the world remain disquietingly acute  particularly those of peace and development.2H. At the political level  the Middle East and southern Africa constitute cases which are clearly disquieting.212.	In the Middle East  Israel is taking refuge behind an attitude of rejection with regard to everything that we consider to be likely to promote peace in the region. The resolutions of the Assembly  the Fez plan of the Arabs  the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people  the existence of the PLOâwhich  however  has been recognized by 117 Statesâall these  to Israel  seem to be merely a succession of secondary problems. According to Israel  the whole world is wrong and only Israel is right. Israel's response to the decisions of the Security Council regarding the non-acquisition of territories by force and withdrawal from territories occupied in this way has been the annexation of East Jerusalem  the annexation of the Golan Heights  the annexation of the West Bank  the bloody occupation of a large portion of Lebanese territory.213.	In such circumstances  to invoke the great principles of the United Nations regarding the Government of Israel  as we do every year  might appear to be a waste of time. However  doubt as to the usefulness of condemnation  which often has no effect  should not lead us to admit the inadmissible. The blithe way in which Israel rejects the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine and its Arab neighbours is as surprising to the whole world as it is revolting.214.	With regard to the problems of peace  how can we fail to recall that the use of force  whatever its immediate result  cannot in the long term guarantee either peace or security? The truth is that the only way to peace is that which presupposes dialogue and negotiation to find just solutions to the conflicts that shake the world today. That is why we welcome the results of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine. The peaceful means proposed there  if scrupulously applied  could undoubtedly lead in the end to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.215.	Who today  even among the most radical enemies of peace  can say that that Conference did not lead to sensible  constructive  realistic conclusions? It is undeniable that the PLO and its Chairman  Yasser Arafat  showed at the Conference an admirable openness and a desire for peace that the United Nations must strive to explore. We must stress in fairness that some Israelis who are champions of peace took part in that Conference  either because they were invited or because they were eminent persons  and they took the opportunity to reaffirm in strong terms their opposition to the policy of the Tel Aviv Government  a policy of stalling  of violating the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine and the rights of the Arab people living in Israel. What we can state is that the way is open to a just solution to the question of Palestine. It is sufficient nowâand the time is rightâto have the courage and determination to take that path  because the peaceful settlement of disputes is a cardinal principle of the Organization  which must continue to guide our actions in our search for peace. The same applies to the other troubled regionsâAsia and Latin America.216.	Sadly  this year again the situation in Asia has not shown any substantial progress towards the solutions the Assembly has called for. Outside forces continue to occupy Afghanistan and Democratic Kampuchea  whose peoples are still suffering from laws imposed by foreign Powers. In order to resolve the question of Afghanistan  it is necessary  in the interests of peace  to maintain the impetus by facilitating continued dialogue  in the context  of course  of the relevant principles of international law  reaffirmed in the Charter.217.	My country  Senegal  which has always opposed foreign interference  would like to take this opportunity to voice once again its active solidarity with the people of Afghanistan in the difficult times which have been imposed on it. My country will continue to support  as it has in the past  the various peace efforts  because it remains convinced that persisting in trying to find a solution by force will only worsen the conflict and increase tension in that part of the world.218.	In Kampuchea  the initiatives aimed at starting a dialogue have been fruitless. The mediation of the ad hoc Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea has still not been accepted by one of the parties. That party's idea of creating a zone of peace in South-East Asia is certainly praiseworthy  but that goal can be attained only if the people of Kampuchea is first able freely to exercise its right to decide its own future.219.	Here as elsewhere  the major concern of my countryâwhich has been entrusted with the chairmanship of the ad hoc Committeeâis to make a positive contribution to the creation of the conditions necessary for the restoration of peace and security in that part of the world. That naturally requires the participation of all the parties concerned in the Committee's efforts  within the framework of the principles from which it derives its mandate.220.	The people of Korea is still divided. My country  which enjoys relations of trust with both countries  remains committed to a peaceful  lasting solution of the Korean questionâthat is  to the reunification of this brother people through a sincere  concerted effort by the two parties. 221.	In Central America  we believe the political settlement of conflicts  whether internal or external  must be based on respect for the rights of peoples and the sovereignty of States. On the basis of this principle  regional guarantees of security and non-interference should enable that region to recover the stability and peace that are indispensable to its development.222.	The particularly sensitive Gulf region continues  because of the unfortunate war between Iran and Iraq  to be a major cause for concern. The international community has no choice today but to persevere in and strengthen the efforts already undertaken under various auspices to persuade the two parties to negotiate a comprehensive  just and honourable settlement.223.	Senegal is a member of the Good Offices Committee set up by the Third Islamic Summit Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  held at Mecca Taif from 25 to 28 January 1981. Side by side with the other member countries of the Committee  under the chairmanship of President Ahmed Sekou Toure of Guinea  it intends to pursue its efforts in the noble quest for peace  harmony and fraternity.224.	In Africa  our continent  the situation is scarcely better. The questions of Namibia and Western Sahara and the conflict in Chad are a constant cause of concern.225.	For several years the question of Namibia has regularly appeared on the Assembly's agenda. It has been the subject of special sessions  international conferences  seminars  symposiums  round table talks  discussions and  above all  very long negotiations.226.	Recently in Paris the international community devoted an in-depth debate to the question during the International Conference in Support of the Struggle of the Namibian People for Independence  held in Paris from 25 to 29 April 1983. After that the Security Council adopted resolution 532 (1983)  which called for the immediate  unconditional implementation of the United Nations settlement plan approved in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).227.	Since then the Secretary-General and his colleagues have continued to put forward initiatives and hold consultations in an attempt to break the deadlock. In recent weeks the Secretary-General has even visited the region to try to make the contacts with the various parties concerned necessary to settle the conflict.228. We believe that our effort must be continued and increased. We must organize it. My country takes this opportunity to reaffirm its unswerving and unreserved support for the brother people of Namibia  for SWAPO  its sole legitimate representative  and for the people of South Africa  who are fighting for respect for human dignity against apartheid and racial discrimination. My country also reaffirms its abiding brotherly solidarity with the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress  whose daily heroic actions we salute.229.	Senegal cannot fail to stress  in order to be honest  the efforts to resolve the question of Namibia that have been made by the countries of the contact group  but these efforts are not sufficient. Insufficient pressure has been put on the Pretoria Government to make it listen to reason and above all to make it respect international law and the relevant decisions of the United Nations. But these efforts have been made. They must be continued and strengthened.230.	That is Senegal's position on the question  and we have reaffirmed here many times our support for the brother people of Namibia and for SWAPO. This was reaffirmed also during the international conference in Paris in April  over which my country presided  and during the meetings of the Security Council in New York from 23 May to 31 May of this year.'""231.	It is also relevant to stress and unhesitatingly condemn the attacks carried out by South Africa  with a disturbing cynicism  directly or indirectly against the brother sovereign peoples of southern Africa  particularly those of Angola  Mozambique  Lesotho  Botswana  Swaziland and Zimbabwe.232.	I cannot conclude my examination of these political questions of concern to our continent without mentioning Western Sahara and Chad. In West Africa  my country continues to believe that the question of Western Sahara can be solved appropriately through a referendum on self-determination  as proposed by His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco during the eighteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held at Nairobi from 24 to 27 June 1981  the principle of which was accepted and reaffirmed in a resolution of that Assembly's nineteenth session  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983 .233.	If we all remain determined to find a solution to this difficult problem consonant with the interests of Africa  there is no doubt we shall soon find a peaceful solution which will constitute yet another legitimate victory for our peoples and our continent over the divisive factors which tend to create factions among us and distract us from the true problems of our development.234.	With regard to the question of Chad  Senegal would reaffirm its commitment to the sacrosanct principles of respect for the territorial integrity of sovereign and independent States. Chad is a Member of the United Nations; Chad is a member of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries; it is a founding member of the OAU: it is a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Consequently its unity and its integrity  respect for its independence  and its development in peace  in African unity and security are and must remain matters of basic concern to the international community. The people of Chad has suffered too long from the divisions imposed on it from outside and from repeated attacks on its sovereignty.235.	In this respect  the legitimate Government in N'Djamena should be free to exercise all its powers and to lead the country to national reconciliation and peace  in the exercise of the rights of the people of Chad. That includes all the sons of Chad  whatever groups they belong to  so that Chad can belong once again to its people.236.	Beside the problem of peace  which is the condition for any useful development of humanity  there is first and foremost the important problem of the world economic situation. It is hardly necessary to emphasize that the two questions are closely linked.237.	The world is in the grip of a full-scale economic crisis. An international effort is necessary if we are to escape from this crisis. The continuing disorganization of the international monetary system  which is the consequence of the crisis as well as the cause of its prolongation  is bound to sharpen the disagreements  misunderstandings and causes of conflict which pit nations against each other through the progressive impoverishment of the peoples of the third world and the demonstrable inability of the industrialized countries to find a speedy and appropriate solution to this deplorable situation.238.	In this respect  the recent World document report of the World Bank is important for more than one reason. It is stated that the 10-year-old world economic crisis  which is the scourge of the third world countries in particular  will not improve over the next 10 years. The magazine jeune afrique	published thisinformation and said:""Assuming a medium growth in our countries  Africa south of the Sahara""âthat is  our countriesâ ""will be the most badly off because the real per income in 1995 will be lower than it was in 1970  and its indebtedness will remain substantial"".239.	This statement shows how urgent it is for us to take all appropriate steps to prevent such an outcome. The time has come for the international community as a whole to demonstrate the constructive political will o respond to this threat to our survival.240.	The second problem concerning us is the disorder in the international monetary system. In monetary and financial matters the developing countries  as we all know  are suffering the direct and very serious harmful effects of monetary disorders in terms of inflation  high interest rates and fluctuating exchange rates  to name only the most obvious.241.	Today  many developing countries are having structural difficulties of a permanent character and find themselves in such a critical situation that they have been obliged to assume further large debts to try to break this deadlock by repaying earlier debts.242.	The debt of the developing countries has moved from $244 billion in 1977 to almost $625 billion in 1982. This excessive indebtedness not only holds up the development of our countries but may in the long term cause the total collapse of the international monetary system  thus also bringing down the richest countries as well.243.	In order to avoid such a disaster  it is necessary for the developed countries to reschedule these debts  in their own interests as well as in those of the developing countries  to strengthen official development assistance and to agree at last to grant loans on favourable terms.244.	What is worse  we are disturbed to see that by the end of 1983  that is  in a few months  military expenditure will have attained $800 billion  whereas official aid from all sources is equivalent to 18 days of the world's military expenditure. If well managed  development assistance can strengthen institutions  promote better policies and enable more productive use of the national resources of the developing countries  thus helping to eliminate hunger and poverty from the world. It makes sense from the economic point of view  but above all it is politically prudent for everybody.245.	The present international economic system  which has led to the current crisis  was designed and built up without any real participation by the developing countries  and it must therefore be reformed in order finally to take proper account of the interests of the third world countries.246.	My country will continue to maintain that  in order to escape from this crisis  specific measures must be taken. In particular Senegal wants to see the trade barriers imposed by certain developed countries lifted  the debts of the developing countries rescheduled  official development assistance substantially increased  the Common Fund for Commodities put into operation  and the commitments to the developing countries concerning the day- to-day execution of their development projects fully respected.247.	If we wish to leave future generations a better world  a world of peace and progress because it is more just and more fraternal  as it is our duty to do  then we must reawaken our human qualities as intelligent human beings  profoundly devoted to the universal ideal of solidarity.248.	These economic matters are important. They have been sufficiently discussed from this rostrum. The sessions of UNCTAD succeed each other without yielding much in the way of tangible results  but the duty of the United Nations is to spare no effort  to ignore no initiative  so that there can be a speedy and judicious reform of the world economic and financial system  so that we can see the establishment of a new system of trade based consciously on the need for a more balanced development of the various parts of the world  in a spirit of dynamic complementarity of benefit to all  in which the interests of all can be protected without harming the interests of any.249.	That is the only way we can succeed in the struggle against underdevelopment  hunger  inequality and exploitation of one nation by another.250.	In conclusion  I should like once again to stress that mankind has already furnished proof  in tragic circumstances in which it might have despaired of its own creative genius  of its infinite capacity to adapt and change situations in response to the needs of the moment.251.	That is why hope must revive in all of us to create a climate of renewed trust among nations sharing the same noble ideals of peace and solidarity  those ideals which 30 years ago inspired the foundation of the United Nations.252.	The efforts of Senegal  of its leader and of its people must be seen in that context.253.	We have a date with history to record the meeting of minds in the world to save our planet from the apocalypse. All countries  small and large  all nations  developed and developing  all cultures and all civilizations must hold hands together in a burst of generosity arising from our awareness of our common humanity  to ensure that our species  which has conquered outer space and has made enormous progress in science and technology  can safeguard its own survival of the basis of what unites human beings of all continent and races  that is  on the basis of our common destiny.

"119",6168,"SGP",38,1983,"ï»¿109.	 Allow me to congratulate Mr. Illueca on his election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. His abilities and his reputation for integrity and goodwill are widely known. I am confident that we shall ail be well served by his presidency. Allow me also to express my appreciation for the tireless efforts of the Secretary- General to further the objectives of the United Nations.110.	Early this month the world condemned a superpower for shooting down a civilian aircraft and killing all 269 passengers on board. Although ICAO is still investigating the tragedy  two facts are beyond dispute. First  the conduct of the Soviet Union in shooting down the civilian aircraft and denying others access to its waters for search and rescue operations is in violation of the rules of international civil aviation. Secondly  the domestic laws of the Soviet Union  which authorize the destruction of intruding civil aircraft  are inconsistent with the Soviet Union's international obligations. We in Singapore  therefore  add our voice to the world-wide appeal to the Soviet Union to admit its responsibility for the tragedy  to pay compensation to the victims and to bring its domestic laws into line with its international undertakings.111.	It is difficult to identify any political problem or conflict where the prospects of achieving progress in the near term look promising. In the Middle East  peace with justice continues to elude us. The Palestinians continue to be denied the right of self-determination and to a homeland of their own. The outcome of efforts to persuade foreign forces to withdraw from Lebanon has not been satisfactory.112.	Both the Soviet Union and Viet Nam continue to defy the international community  and their troops remain in occupation of Afghanistan and Kampuchea respectively. Military might has not  however  been able to crush the spirit of resistance. Nationalist forces in both Afghanistan and Kampuchea have grown steadily in strength  ensuring that the invaders will continue to pay a high price.113.	We in ASEAN have continued to seek a political settlement in Kampuchea. Our proposals would secure the legitimate interest of all the countries of South-East Asia and the right to self-determination of the Kampuchean people. Our proposals have been endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the international community  but Hanoi has refused to loosen its grip over Kampuchea. The tragedy is that it is the people of Kampuchea who suffer. We in ASEAN invite Viet Nam to join us in the search for a process that would result in the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and the establishment of a neutral Kampuchea.114.	The United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia cannot be implemented because of South Africa's insistence on linking the plan's implementation to the withdrawal of foreign forces from a neighbouring country. The intercommunal talks in Cyprus grind on without progress. In Central America  bloodshed continues. There are no simple solutions. Genuine economic and political reform is necessary. But countries in the region must have the means to resist foreign-backed subversion and insurgency. Domestic changes and problems cannot provide a pretext for foreign-inspired take-overs.115.	I could continue this catalogue of the world's woes. We are no closer to solving any of the conflicts and tensions that preoccupied us last year. Nevertheless  this year we meet under slightly less gloomy circumstances than last year. The fact that the industrialized countries of the North seem at last to be slowly pulling out of recession is cause for guarded optimism.116.	Not all the countries of the third world will  however  benefit from the economic recovery in the North. The harsh fact is that the recovery in the North will only imperfectly  unequally and slowly be transmitted to the South. But we cannot deny that the recovery gives us hope that the worst is over.117.	There is  however  no reason to be sanguine. No one knows how long this recovery will last. It could be choked off by high interest rates  or the huge debt overhang of less developed countries could bring the banking system cashing down on all of us. Most important  the end of the recession does not mean that many of us will necessarily come closer to achieving the economic and social goals we have struggled for.118.	For the past decade or so  countries of the third world have sought to organize themselves politically and economically in order to impress upon the developed countries of the North the need for a new international economic order. The record thus far has not been very encouraging. Appeals for a new deal have for the most part fallen on deaf ears. This was perhaps inevitable so long as the developed countries were mired in recession.119.	It would be comforting to think that with economic recovery there will be greater support for special measures to assist economic development in the countries of the third world.120.	The reality  unfortunately  may be very different. The countries of the North are more and more preoccupied with solving problems which have arisen in their relations with each other and so may come to see the South as increasingly peripheral to their welfare and to the recovery of the ailing international economy. In addition  there is a growing conviction in the North that much of the cause for the failure of the South to achieve more rapid development is due to misguided domestic policies in the countries of the South. Good will  a sense of guilt or self-interestâwhatever it is that motivates those who strongly support special assistance to countries in the South is being rapidly exhausted.121.	The recovery will therefore not mean a return to business as usual. The industries of the developed countries are undergoing a period of profound technological change that will restructure the world economy. Robotics and computerization are already revolutionizing production processes in the same way that mass production and assembly-line methods revolutionized production early this century. Further down the road  advances in such fields of basic science as genetic engineering and biotechnology and artificial intelligence will also have a far- reaching impact.122.	A further change that we will see in the North is in the outmoded institutions  such as labour and management practices and attitudes forged during the first industrial revolution. These rigidities have hindered Europe and North America in absorbing new management and production techniques. The result has been a decline in competitiveness usually redounding to Japan's advantage. Those countries must  and will  set about creating new institutions and practices that will enable them to regain their competitive strength.123.	All these changes pose challenges for us in the third world. They will make it possible for the developed countries to increase productivity and output with less labour. The introduction of automated production processes will erode the comparative advantage of the less-developed countries in cheap and plentiful labour. Economic recovery will not necessarily bring down levels of unemployment in the developed countries. Political pressures for protectionism will therefore not necessarily abate and may even become endemic. While this will naturally have an adverse impact upon our exports  the most dangerous consequences are far more subtle. Under electoral pressure and natural greed  the industrial North may hold on both to the labour-intensive industries and to the industries employing the new technology.124.	The fact is that the North is not really very concerned over competition from low-cost imports from the South. It is today evident that the developed countries of the North are far more preoccupied with each other than with the third world. Trade frictions between the European Community and the United States  between the European Community and Japan and between Japan and the United States have been far more significant and have had a greater impact on the world economy than North- South problems.125.	With the cost advantage arising from the cheap labour of third world countries being eroded by the new productive processes  we in the third world can no longer automatically depend upon a steady flow of investments from the North even if the world economy picks up dramatically. Developed countries may find it increasingly more profitable to locate plants in their own home countries to tap the highly educated and highly skilled labour needed by the new processes of production. The persistence of protectionism may also restructure existing patterns of capital flows  especially private capital flows. We already find  for example  Japanese companies setting up new plants in Europe and the United States in order to mute criticism and guarantee market access.126.	As these trends work themselves out in the coming years  there is a real danger that the developed countries will come to believe that by themselves they can constitute a self-sustaining and closed international trading and economic system that can safely afford to ignore the rest of us in the third world.127.	Needless to say  this is simply not true. I need only point out that in recent years more than 40 per cent of all United States exports have been to developing countries; more than 23 per cent of all exports from the European Community and some 57 per cent of all Japanese exports have also gone to developing countries. The magnitude of these trade flows shows that North andSouth form a single interdependent system in which neither can ignore the other without dire political and economic consequences.128.	Asserting this fact  however  is not enough. The record of North-South negotiations has demonstrated that warnings or cries for help fall on deaf ears. We will be heeded only if we help ourselves. To be taken seriously  each country in the third world needs to organize itself to face the challenges of the recovery. We cannot ignore the implications of the new technology. Unless we acquire new skills  identify new opportunities and absorb new ideas  we will be left on the wayside of development. We need to retrain  upgrade and educate. We must move up or remain  as we have been  hewers of wood and drawers of water.129.	The measures needed to lift ourselves out of stagnation and low growth are more within our control than we care to admit. We have only to seek the reasons why some countries in the South have succeeded where others have failed. We will find that it is domestic policies that have made the difference. Pragmatic economic policies based on a sound knowledge of what motivates individuals and societies; education  training and social policies to elicit maximum effort; and institutions that meet specific local conditionsâthese are the ingredients of the success of the nations in the South which have managed to break the vicious cycle of poverty and stagnation. Such domestic policies have the great advantage of being within the control of each Government for their formulation and implementation  unlike schemes of international restructuring which no single Government can hope to influence decisively. The potential consuming power of the South  if translated into reality  gives it a more powerful leverage against the productive North. Production and consumption are inseparable elements of economic growth and prosperity.130.	The South has too often defined the challenge of development in terms of the past. To be sure  a history of colonization and exploitation has trapped much of the third world in a vicious cycle of poverty. But the future has its own vicious cycle. Technology can trap us in poverty as surely as history. I do not think that our peoples will be much consoled if  in seeking to redress the injustices of the past  we fail to meet the challenges of the future. "
"120",6201,"SLB",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 My first and foremost obligation is to convey to the Assembly warm greetings from the people and Government of Solomon Islands. Although I have come some time after the commencement of this particular session  may I extend my most sincere wishes for its success.2.	The people and Government of Solomon Islands warmly salute your election  Sir  as the President of this session. We are confident that with your vast experience as a diplomat you will lead the Assembly's deliberations to a fruitful conclusion.3.	We also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  for his commendable work during the last session.4.	To the ever-hard-working Secretary-General we say this: We are fully aware of the very difficult tasks entrusted to you in your high office. Admirably  your diplomatic tact has over the past year persistently succeeded in bringing about understanding in areas of great conflicts of interests.5.	When  five years ago  my country was admitted as a Member of this great Organization  we were so warmly welcomed by all our friends here. In return for that intimate welcome  the Solomon Islands people and Government have the great pleasure of welcoming Saint Christopher and Nevis to this family of nations. We congratulate the people and Government of Saint Christopher and Nevis on their achievement of statehood  and we wish them every success in the years ahead.6.	The purpose of my being here today is twofold: first  to reaffirm the commitment of Solomon Islands to the Charter of the United Nations and its principles; and secondly  to express our concern over certain issues which have important implications for the international community  particularly for the survival of humanity. Solomon Islands has pledged its commitment to the ideals of the Organization in the firm belief that it holds the hope and potential for the betterment of all the peoples around the globe  including our own people in Solomon Islands. We reaffirm this very pledge today. We also pledged five years ago that we would do that which was within our capability and means to promote peace and harmony in the world. We accordingly reaffirm that pledge too.7.	We renew these pledges  including our support for the various organs of the United Nations  with the full realization that Solomon Islands is a small island developing nation whose resources may not go very far towards resolving tensions that threaten the noble aims of the United Nations: to replace war with peace and to live with civilized behaviour instead of violence.8.	Herein lie  our concern. The weapons of war are such that the peace and security of our peoples throughout the world are at stake. Today the situation in parts of Asia  Africa  Latin America  the Middle East and the North Pacific endanger the peace and security not only of the countries of those regions but also of the entire global community.9.	In this respect  we join in the call to bring peace and stability to Lebanon. Our support for the various United Nations resolutions and peace plans for Israel and Palestine is strongly maintained  as we believe these provide a basis for a negotiated and lasting solution.10.	The conflict between Iran and Iraq is most regretted by the Solomon Islands Government. These two oil-rich countries are being tom apart and much suffering has been caused for their peoples. But the overall effects of this conflict are being felt not only by the people of those two countries but elsewhere by the innocent peoples of other countries of the world.11.	My Government strongly believes in the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. Thus  we earnestly urge those involved to withdraw their forces from Afghanistan and Kampuchea. In relation to Kampuchea we welcome and support the initiative of the Association of South-East Asian Nations for peace and stability in that region.12.	The South Pacific is a stable region  but the situation in Korea  in the North Pacific  poses a threat. The policy of the Solomon Islands Government is that the parties involved must recognize the need for and the necessity of a peaceful settlement through negotiation without outside interference.13.	At this juncture  I wish to state categorically my Government ; position regarding the two most recent acts of total disregard for human dignity and lives. The e two acts are the hallmark of barbarism and insincerityin terms of the United Nations desire for civilized behaviour. I refer here to the downing of the Korean airliner by a Soviet military aircraft early last month and the bomb blast in Rangoon early this month.14.	Only those with inhuman feelings and thoughts could fail to condemn these premeditated actions causing the loss of human lives. Whatever the reasons  Solomon Islands condemn these incidents  and those responsible must ask themselves whether such acts are in keeping with intentions of the Charter. It is sporadic incidents of this kind which pose a real threat to world peace and civilized human relations.15.	The United Nations has done much for the decolonization process  and we are glad that this is still a top priority. We welcome the Secretary-General's efforts in pursuit of the implementation of the United Nations plan for the liberation of Namibia. The successful achievement of independence by Namibia will be significant for the liberation of the indigenous peoples of southern Africa who are still plagued by the evil system of apartheid. This system  in all its manifestations  must be totally eliminated because it is inhuman and uncivilized.16.	Mention has already been made by colleagues from the South Pacific islands region of the question of New Caledonia. My Government upholds the principle of self- determination for colonized peoples  and it is therefore our desire to see the smooth transition of New Caledonia to peaceful independence. To this extent  the French Government's intention to move this territory towards an act of self-determination is encouraging. But I sincerely plead that this intention be translated into action  in line with the wishes of the people of New Caledonia. Otherwise  procrastination will inevitably lead to inaction.17.	The international economic situation is also of great concern to the Solomon Islands Government. Just as the world is confronted with the threat of nuclear war and mounting political tensions resulting from the escalating arms race  developing countries such as Solomon Islands are confronted with the gloomy global economic climate. Our independence and nationhood would be quite meaningless without an appreciable degree of viability  but this depends to a very large extent on the recognition and appreciation by the developed countries and multilateral financial institutions of our basic development needs.18.	The greatest challenge that faces the international community is the pursuit of a balanced utilization and distribution of resources on a fair basis  taking into consideration that the ultimate goal of development internationally is the betterment of all mankind. Unfortunately  the prospects of developing countries are getting bleaker as the developed countries advance to new heights of industrialization and sophisticated technology.19.	It is interesting to note that the Williamsburg Declaration on Economic Recovery  issued at the Summit of Industrialized Nations in May of this year  acknowledges that the weight of the recession has fallen heavily on developing countries. Yet no solutions to the third world's problems seem to be in sight. If solutions should be forthcoming  and we hope they will be  then a certain degree of emphasis should be given to all small island States  to give us some slight preference over our bigger third world brother countries. The United Nations and its agencies have a duty to ensure special treatment for small island States like Solomon Islands.20.	Solomon Islands  as an island nation depending on its marine resources for a major part of its livelihood  joins other South Pacific countries in strongly condemning and opposing nuclear testing and the dumping and storage of nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean. These are inhuman acts and they are a real threat to our economic development. In this regard  I am obliged to point out that Solomon Islands is opposed to and abhors attempts by super-Power rivalries to infiltrate the South Pacific region. In the South Pacific  and I believe in the third world generally  we expect the super-Powers to assist us in our development instead of trying to steer us towards dehumanization and eventual destruction.21.	Our seas and soil provide the main sources of livelihood in Solomon Islands  and their pollution is fatal to our future survival. That is why we attach great importance to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Solomon Islands is a signatory to this Convention  and steps are being taken to ratify it at the earliest possible opportunity.22.	I am pleased to announce that Solomon Islands has just established its permanent mission here in New York this month. This is a great achievement for us in terms of our foreign relations. In fact  it is our first overseas mission ever  and it reflects the great importance we attach to our commitment to the United Nations and its noble work. For this  we are grateful to Australia and the Commonwealth secretariat for assisting us. Having realized this achievement  Solomon Islands is well placed to request the United Ns ;;<ins Secretariat to examine or review the protocol dealing with the admission of new States as Members and the accreditation of their permanent representatives thereto. I say this out of the experience which the Solomon Islands has had in the pas t five years. Although Solomon Islands was admitted as a full Member in September 1978  our permanent representative's accreditation was not accepted  merely because we did not have a permanent mission in New York. In our view  this protocol requires serious examination so that small States such as ours are not deprived of their privileges as full Members of the United Nations because of their obvious financial constraints.23.	We have overcome this awkward situation and are now able to meet the cumbersome protocol and procedural requirements. On this basis  let me assure all the representatives that we will now participate more fully in the deliberations of the General Assembly and its committees and agencies. I hope  in future sessions  that we will participate with Solomon's wisdom.  "

Your impressive record as a diplomat  a jurist and a renowned statesman accounts for the support you have received from the Assembly in its electing you to preside over its affairs.Permit me also  Mr. President  to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  for the commendable efforts he deployed as President of the thirty-seventh session. We recognize his valuable contributions to our efforts in promoting the goals of the United Nations.May I also take this opportunity to welcome into this group of nations the new State of Saint Christopher and Nevis as a Member of the United Nations. We congratulate the Government and people on their independence and wish them every success in their task of nation-building.Last year  my Government  concerned with the increasingly deteriorating international relations and the danger this posed for international peace and security  as well as the detrimental effect it was having on the Organization  called on the membership to implement the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations relating to the maintenance of international peace and security.While the Security Council has been considering this issue over the past year  it is a matter of regret to my Government that meanwhile the international situation has not only deteriorated  but the threat of nuclear war has become even more menacing and real. For even today we meet against the backdrop of the unfortunate Korean civil airliner incident  resulting in the loss of life of 269 innocent people. The atmosphere and condition of mind that gave rise to this incident are  in our view  both regrettable and deplorable.Even more alarming is the fact that with the increase in international tension  the uninterrupted arms race and the threat posed by nuclear weapons  the Organization stands helpless  unable to take meaningful initiatives to arrest this drift towards self-immolation. It was with a view to averting this danger that heads of State of the Non-Aligned Movement  in their meeting at New Delhi  called for a strengthening of the role of the United Nations to avert the threat of nuclear catastrophe.It may be recalled that it was after a global catastrophe some 38 years ago that we  ""the peoples of the United Nations  determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind""  founded the United Nations.Today  if I appear on this rostrum  it is to reaffirm the faith and determination of my Government and people  as we helplessly watch the incidents of global tension rising every day  whether they be on the mountains and plains of Central America; in the streets and arid plains of the Middle East  reflecting the anguish of the Palestinian people to be born as a State; in the towns and villages of South-East Asia or in the deserts of Chad; in the struggle of the people of Namibia to be born free as an independent nation in the denial of the human dignity of the black people of	South Africa; and even  in the futile fratricidal war in the Gulf area. We see in all this a catalogue of woes and tribulations besetting our world. States have selfishly ignored the pledge we made when our founding fathers adopted the Organization's Charter. Today  what do we see? Nations continue to take up arms against nations and factions have been created within States  with adverse consequences for international peace and security.It is our firm belief that as long as we continue to ignore the pledges and commitments enshrined in the Charter and refuse to utilize its procedures and provisions  so long shall our world be plagued by these problems and  indeed  new sets of problems. It is in this regard  therefore  that my Government believes that the General Assembly should be the echo chamber of the conscience of the international community. We should use the United Nations to articulate common problems and focus our energies to find solutions to them. This is the message I want to reiterate  as the head of a small  independent country grappling with the problems of nation-building in a world distracted  self-distracted if you will  by political tension born of mistrust among nations.Even as the world is confronted with the threat of nuclear annihilation and mounting political tension  because of the escalating arms race  developing countries such as mine face no less a threat to their very survival as nation States in the equally serious international economic situation. The complex problems that today constitute the international economic malaise have been discussed in various international forums  and it is no hidden secret that  increasingly  the continued viability of many of the newly independent countries as nation States is becoming bleaker in an inexorably hostile economic world. Unless the international community immediately comes to terms with the situation  even that glorious chapter of the Organization  that of political decolonization  may have to be rewritten.The burden of the crisis has been felt within the international monetary system. It has been reflected in severe cutbacks in finance and development assistance and in unacceptable restrictions in terms of trade  both for manufactured goods from the newly industrialized countries and for agricultural raw materials and minerals from non-oil-exporting countries.The result of all this has been disappointing as regards the improvement of the social and economic welfare of millions of people across the globe  whose legitimate expectations of well-being remain disappointed and unfulfilled.Inasmuch as it is evident that every country represented here today has  in one way or the other  been affected by the global economic crisis  the one inescapable fact remains that the world stands in need of a new order to rearrange our social and economic relationship. More than ever before  we need imagination  compassion and  above all  the political initiative and will to meet the deepening economic crisis and afford our peoples the improved standard of life that is their due. It is not by acrimony  confrontation and division that this new order I speak of will evolve or be established  but rather by the recognition and the affirmation of our mutuality of interest and our indissoluble interdependence.The rapid expansion of international travel  the unprecedented movement of money and finance across continents  the possibilities of easily transmitting disease and illness over vast distances  cosmic pollution and a myriad of other problems all attest to the need for the Organization to address itself to the question of global interdependence. It therefore behaves us all to recognize that only in this course lies our collective and individual salvation  and that this is our understanding of fairness and equity.Allow me to aver that even though the present state of the world economy has unfavorably affected the countries of the world as a whole  and the developing countries above all  it is  however  generally recognized that the least developed among them have suffered most and because of the weakness of their economic structures are the least likely to benefit from any economic recovery without massive international support from the major donors and financial institutions. In this regard  the achievement of the objectives of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries ' unanimously adopted in Paris in 1981  is more than ever a valid goal.In this connection  let me take this opportunity to express to the Secretary-General my Government's appreciation for recently sending an inter-agency mission to assess  the assistance needs of Sierra Leone  with the aim of mobilizing the financial and other resources necessary to implement the programmes and projects identified in the report. The report is an official document before this session of the Assembly. I therefore urge all States and relevant institutions and organizations to give it the necessary attention with the aim of participating effectively in a donors conference to be organized in due course.I would like at this juncture to express the gratitude and appreciation of my Government and people to all agencies and organizations  within and outside the United Nations system  which are rendering assistance to my country. We have no doubt that these institutions and agencies could give humanity greater assistance if only we could minister the necessary political will to provide them with the resources they require to fulfil their mandates. These institutions  by their role and function  give practical meaning to one of the cardinal principles of the Charter by promoting social progress  improving standards of life and ensuring the economic and social advancement of all peoples and thereby strengthening the fabric of international peace and security.The United Nations was born out of the lessons of the last global catastrophe I spoke of earlier. Let us  therefore  apply the lessons of that global catastrophe  reaffirm our faith and uphold and respect the organs  procedures and provisions of the Charter  for only in this way can we assuredly fulfil our pledges to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. I affirm the commitment of the Government and people of Sierra Leone to this end. "
"122",6294,"SLV",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 Both for my delegation as a whole and for me personally  Sir  it is a great honour to congratulate you most warmly and cordially on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  for you have a great knowledge of world affairs  and from my friendship with you  I know that you are also a sincere and mighty fighter in the cause of peace.2.	The Secretary-General also deserves the appreciation of the people and the Government of El Salvador and of all the peoples and Governments of the world for the work he has done to promote international peace and harmony  which are seriously threatened at the present time.3.	It is a pleasure for me cordially to welcome Saint Christopher and Nevis as a new Member of the United Nations. We wish it every success in its efforts to achieve prosperity and development.4.	The present tragic situation in El Salvador and in Central America in general is complicated by various external factors which  in involved situations  have a decisive influence that damages the national dignity of our countries  widens the conflict and adds new protagonists and that  within an international ideological struggle foreign to the interests of our sovereign will  limits our ability to make our own decisions.5.	No objective critical observer can be unaware that the crisis of El Salvador and Central America has been exacerbated by violence  destruction  terror  the threat of war in the region and an attempt from outside to apply political and ideological concepts which are diametrically opposed to the form of social organization adopted by our peoples.6.	The presence of this ideological bipolarity can be seen in the deterioration and breaking down of the normal harmonious relations among the countries of the area  violating in practice and repeatedly the sacred principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of the various brother countries.7.	Totalitarian ideological aggressiveness is accompanied in the region by logistic and propaganda support for those armed groups which share that same philosophy. They are being strengthened by external allies  all dependent on a central headquarters which fosters and promotes a strategy of world-wide expansion.8.	There is an attempt to implement this strategy of political and ideological expansion in Central America  thus dramatically hampering the achievement of our own national aspirations to build a truly humane  just  pluralist and participatory society  which is what my country is trying to do in working towards democratization.9.	The values of Western democracy are deeply rooted in the Salvadorian people  and it is on this basis that we hope to build a new homeland  free of the oppression and social stigmas of the past  based on the quest for human development and freedom and on social consensus through participative machinery and institutions. It is to this that the Salvadorian people aspires. This is what was expressedâat some risk  but freelyâon that historic 28 March 1982 when  in national elections to choose a Constituent Assembly  the people voted for peace  justice and ideological pluralism; in a word  it voted for democracy and a better and honorable destiny for our coming generations.10.	El Salvador demands that the Governments outside the area respect the sovereignty and right to self-determination of the Central American peoples  since if they persist in the opposite course all attempts to find a just  lasting and peaceful solution to the problems in the region will be fruitless.11.	We consider that our peoples will achieve true peace and freedom  not through the imposition of arms and ideology  but through greater cultural awareness  better standards of living and freedom of thought  so that on the basis of a diversity of opinions and trends we can achieve the social consensus and political stability needed for sustained development  thus making possible theProgressive realization of our national aspirations and the unrestricted exercise of all individual and social human rights.12.	El Salvador recognizes that  on the basis of the free exercise of democracy which must be adopted internally by every one of the Central American countries  it will be possible to achieve and strengthen peace and democracy in the region. Once we have passed this difficult stage in our shared history it will be possible to reactivate mechanisms for integration and co-operation and together build a better and more united destiny.13.	On behalf of my people and my Government  I wish to reiterate on this occasion the fervent hope and firm conviction that peace will be achieved as soon as possible in order effectively to realize the aspirations of all the Central American peoples for the establishment of democracy  social justice  the full respect for human rights and international brotherhood. In this connection  I wish to make a sincere appeal for good will  comprehension and reasonable understanding  so that we may overcome our differences in an acceptable way and arrive at the much desired peace to which our peoples aspire and which is so necessary in these troubled days when the clouds of military confrontation darken our horizons.14.	In the specific case of my country and Central America  the arduous and difficult task of achieving peace is a historic responsibility before God  before our peoples and before the international community.15.	I am completely convinced that only through democratic machinery will it be possible to achieve harmonious coexistence in keeping with the ideals of our peoples.16.	That is why in spite of the obstacles and dangers that await us  our efforts cannot falter; on the contrary  we are prepared to redouble our endeavors and to maintain all our good will until our mandate from the Salvadorian people to achieve peace has been fulfilled.17.	In the context of the Salvadorian crisis a series of international and internal factors have worked together  compounded by the consequences of natural phenomena.18.	The world economic crisis has had an impact on the Salvadorian economy  as reflected in a deterioration of our purchasing power  balance-of-payments problems  an increase in external indebtedness and other factors. When this is viewed in conjunction with the domestic economic crisis aggravated by recent natural phenomena  and the systematic destructive and irrational acts of senseless individuals who consider the destruction of national infrastructure and sources of employment to be a tactical matter  it becomes possible to appreciate the sacrifices being made by the Salvadorian people and its desire to struggle for peace and democratic formulas. But it will never yield before the specter of blackmail and destruction.19.	Clearly  efforts to strengthen economic relations must go hand in hand with a reduction in international conflicts  to make possible a more just development and a more harmonious coexistence in international society  especially in those countries which are subject to the manipulation of foreign interests.20.	We have been very pleased to see the increased presence of Latin American countries within the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which is a further reaffirmation of respect for the sovereignty and independence of each State 21.	I said as much in the letter of 1 July to Mrs. Indira Gandhi  the Prime Minister of India  in her capacity as Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. I am confident that during the period that Movement is under her leadership there will be a return to the initial path that characterized the founding principles of equidistance and authentic non-alignment  making it possible for third world countries once again to have an appropriate forum to present their shared views and face the international crisis. We hope that this attitude will contribute constructively in channelling the initiatives of the Movement within the ideological framework that constituted the original reason for its establishment.22.	El Salvador wishes to reaffirm its strong commitment to the sister Argentine Republic in its aspirations to achieve the exercise of its sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands  and we fervently appeal to the parties to the conflict to resolve their difficulties through negotiations within the framework of this universal Organization.23.	In connection with the conflict in the Middle East  my country wishes to say that its duration and unforeseeable consequences are extremely disquieting aspects of the problem of maintaining international peace and security. Only a just and lasting solution will make it possible to overcome the crisis in that region  and to that end all members of the international community must recognize the formal existence of the State of Israel and its right to exist within its internationally recognized borders  free from all external threat or pressure  and  similarly  to accept and recognize the right of the Palestinian people to the establishment of its own national State. We consider both aspirations as legitimate and as urgently needed for reaching a satisfactory solution.24.	With respect to the situation in Lebanon  my country reiterates its profound conviction that in order to achieve a peaceful solution it is essential  first of all  that the present truce be respected by all the parties concerned so that it may eventually lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces and thus make it possible for Lebanon to exercise full sovereignty and its right to self-determination. The dismemberment of the national State can never be accepted.25.	The search for peaceful and democratic solutions to conflicts is the correct way to achieve national and international reconciliation.26.	Hence my country is upset at the development of events which  far from contributing to the settlement of differences among States  deepens them. The war between Iran and Iraq is a clear reflection of this. None the less  that war should not lead the international community to frustration and impotence.27.	The Government of El Salvador is deeply concerned at the nature of the conflict in Afghanistan. Everyone is aware that the expansionist policy of the Soviet Union  in addition to being an aberration  is a latent threat to security and peaceful coexistence among States.28.	This is why the people and Government of El Salvador hope that the Afghan people will be able to determine their own destiny  without any kind of interference  as soon as possible.29.	In connection with the military intervention by Viet Nam in Kampuchea  my Government considers that the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops is an urgent prerequisite for the achievement of peace in South-East Asia.30.	It is regrettable that  in spite of the resolutions and appeals by the United Nations and other international bodies  the Government of South Africa shows no real sign of abandoning the policy of racial segregation. The practice and the spread of	is a constant element in the system of domination imposed by the South African Government and is a violation of social justice  fundamental human rights and international peace and security. Therefore  El Salvador reiterates anew its condemnation of apartheid and urges the United Nations and other international bodies to redouble their efforts to bring about the elimination of that practice. My country also condemns the illegal occupation of the territory of Namibia by the South African Government.31.	The new conflicts in the international society reflect  regrettably  an increase in hostility and tension in international relations. This should prompt reflection on the state of general crisis that threatens the entire international community.32.	The invasion of Chad  supported by the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  is a clear reflection of the totalitarian desire for world domination. Central America  which is experiencing such destabilizing and anti-democratic foreign interference  understands the difficulties and contradictions which arise. Therefore El Salvador cannot fail to express its support for respect for the right of self-determination for the people of Chad and the principle of non-intervention in their internal affairs.33.	I wish to refer  with great concern  to the bringing down of the South Korean civilian airliner by the Soviet Union  in which 269 persons lost their lives. In addition to violating the norms of international civil aviation  this was a completely unjustifiable violation of fundamental human rights and an act of unprecedented barbarity. The people and Government of El Salvador express their most forceful condemnation of this irrational act and join in mourning the innocent victims  with special sympathy for the people of South Korea. Furthermore  we find it most strange that many international organizations entrusted with the safeguarding and protection of human rights has not taken a stand in connection with this shocking matter. We therefore urge them to abandon the discriminatory practice of judging Governments on the basis of ideological considerations.34.	Antagonisms in Central America are increasing as a result of the clear practice by some regimes of intervention in the external and internal affairs of other countries  as well as the stepping up of an irrational arms race and the promotion and toleration of the illegal arms traffic.35.	My Government is aware of the danger and that is why  in keeping with its democratic domestic objectives  its foreign policy is based on doctrinal principles of a universal character and on support for the struggles of the countries of the third world to reclaim what is theirs  countries with which we share the common denominator of underdevelopment and the quest for a better future  through equitable development and just and active cooperation among all the nations of the Earth.36.	In my country  the difficult path towards peace and democracy is based on the consensus of my fellow citizens and on their strong resolve to achieve those objectives and leave behind forever the long night of terror through which we have lived.37.	We are aware that such aspirations must be based on the political will to live in a democracy  for which the unanimous decision and determination of a people and its leaders is necessary. This is precisely what inspires the people and Government of El Salvador in their endeavour to bequeath to future generations a homeland free of ignominy  vengeance and fear.38.	If we wish to achieve peace in Central America and spare our compatriots suffering and bloodshed  we cannot continue to endure the scourge of intervention- ism nor should we tolerate the intermediaries or their destabilizing acts. We demand respect for the democratic processes of each of our countries  so that we may direct our efforts towards peace and social and economic development.39.	The Central American problem can be seen as a regional problem  since it affects the region as a whole. It also has a multilateral dimension since it affects each one of the countries of the region. Therefore the crises must be tackled simultaneously and comprehensively because of the interrelation of the factors involved.40.	Peace is the solution to the Central American crisis  and in order to achieve it we must work on four basic points: first  the promotion of integral and balanced development in the region directed towards restructuring and social change; secondly  the establishment  promotion and development of democratic  pluralist and participatory institutions; thirdly  the safeguarding of respect for human rights in their various manifestations; and fourthly  the re-establishment of security in Central America  rejecting aggression and foreign intervention.41.	In this context my Government is clearly aware of the need for regional dialogue to promote agreement leading to peace  without foreign intervention or pressure. Dialogue presupposes the rejection of violence  good faith among the parties and understanding of differing views and positions. In other words  with dialogue there are neither victors nor vanquished; it can end only in understanding that makes possible peace for all. We have proposed in the General Assembly dialogue within a regional framework; we have also done so in the Organization of American States; and in March of this year we reiterated this proposal in the Security Councilâalways in the hope that the international community would understand our aspirations.42.	We desire a peaceful and democratic solution in Central America  because that is in conformity with the principle of harmonious coexistence in international law.43.	We want regional dialogue; because we have no wish to be either an active or a passive part of the East-West conflict  or the victims of a tragedy in which foreign actors  gratuitous critics and spectators show us the path we should follow. The problems of the region should be solved by Central Americans themselves. Only in this way can the solution have a firm basis  guaranteeing for the future a harmonious balance  political stability and social calm.44.	We consider it necessary that a peaceful solution to the Central American crisis should include the following elements.45.	The first is related to the implementation of the traditional principles of international law  such as respect for the self-determination of peoples  legal equality of States  non-intervention in internal affairs  peaceful settlement of disputes and co-operation for development.46.	For peace to be brought to Central America  it is of particular importance that democracy be established in each country of the region through the implementation of a truly democratic process in the political  economic and social spheres.47.	Furthermore  there is a need to promote the establishment of machinery for internal reconciliation  especially in those countries which are divided  in order to make it possible for all sectors to participate in the politico-democratic process of their respective countries.48.	Democracy in the region is a sine qua now for peace. Failure by a single country to promote the democratic process and its values upsets the state of harmony and stability. Unless democracy is institutionalized  there will be no balance. Undemocratic processes inspired by Marxism are by their very nature and their concept of history inevitably expansionist. 49.	In order to guarantee the security of Central American States  there is a need to curb the arms race and make an inventory of weaponry in order to seek a reduction.50.	There should be a limitation of regular forces and the prohibition of irregular forces  as well as a limitation and reduction of military advisers and other foreigners participating in similar activities. Effective control of weapons traffic within and outside the region should be imposed on persons  organizations or groups that attempt through armed action to destabilize Governments.51.	it is also important to promote machinery for economic co-operation and regional interchange in order to restructure the process of economic integration  making social change and development possible.52.	All this require acceptance  proper development and control mechanisms  supervision and guarantees for strict and real compliance with the agreements that may be reached. Coercive measures must be provided to deal with those who violate those agreements or who fail to comply with them.53.	The Contadora Group  as a regional and Latin American action  also enjoys international support. It is progressing in its efforts to ease tension and is contributing to the building of peace.54.	We must bear in mind that in processes towards peace  confidence is gained through deeds and actions; it is thus increased and strengthened. Unfortunately it can also deteriorate and even be lost. It is not the opinion of third parties that matters  but rather the perception  the experience and orientation of the discussions of Governments of the countries directly concerned. Towards this end  we formally reiterate from this forum  and shall do so in others  our trust in multilateral dialogue in the region and in a comprehensive and simultaneous solution as the best way of obtaining peace and agreement  to which our peoples so dearly aspire.55.	It is regrettable that in the context of the General Assembly a factor has been introduced by Nicaragua  that is  the request for the inclusion of an item on the situation in Central America  which will no doubt have harmful effects on the efforts of the Contadora Group  because it will weaken that forum by internationalizing the conflict and involving other protagonists who are unaware of the regional situation or who are motivated by alien considerations. The Nicaraguan request runs counter to the Contadora Group's objectives of peace and to peace in Central America.56.	It has been clearly stated and recognized that the crisis in my country was caused by internal socio-economic and political conditions which encouraged injustice and social deprivation. In order to correct that situation  basic initial measures have been adopted that will strengthen the machinery for the new process of social  economic and political change so that it can become a reality  a change in which Salvadorians can find true political pluralism and which will raise our society to a democratic level with full social participation  contributing to the betterment of the individual and of society as  a whole.57.	In order to achieve these objectives  structural reforms have been instituted and broadened. Their achievements are already widely known  at home and abroad. The major goals pursued through agrarian reform and nationalization of banking and foreign trade are the apex of our national determination to root out once and for all the internal factors that caused the social crisis.58.	In order to achieve internal harmony and democracy  the Government of El Salvador  together with the commissions on peace and human rights  drafted the law of amnesty and civic rehabilitation  approved by unanimous decision of the members of the Constituent Assembly.59.	We are convinced that the problem of El Salvador is complex  with both internal and external causes  but interventionism  based on a misunderstood political and ideological internationalism  in reality prevents us from advancing more speedily in our process of democratization.60.	Domestically we are making efforts to achieve peace  and we consider that along these lines the elections to be held in the near future in our country  with the participation of <dl Salvadorians who cherish democracy  are a means and a beginning of a process to achieve definitive  lasting peace in order to establish a democratic system.61.	In order to strengthen these endeavours  my Government has shown its readiness to promote the participation of all political forces without exception in the programme of peace that has been designed. Along these lines  the peace commission clearly appealed for dialogue to the political sector of the armed opposition  in order to determine the conditions and guarantees of its participation in future elections. Contacts have been made and initial meetings have been held between that peace commission and the armed opposition  so that the process of dialogue has already begun. Likewise  many appeals have been issued to those who have taken up arms  asking them to lay down their weapons and to participate with all goodwill in the building of our country and the strengthening of our democratic institutions  thus making it possible to establish a strong social  pluralist  participative system  promoting the full development of our society.62.	On behalf of the Salvadorian people  my Government has proposed a true democratic alternative to our situation so that peace can be the natural outcome of a political process  based on social consensus which should be established in the coming elections and in the growing flexibility of our democratic system.63.	In this context  peace should also be the product of the strengthening of social reforms  economic recovery and the enjoyment of human rights.64.	That is why I wish to finish by making an appeal that together we all reflect  in this hour of blood and fire  on the urgent need for dialogue for peace. Too many have died already in my country and in other countries. They died because  as in a famous poem  they were asked to give their lives to obtain peace. They gave their lives without a protest  but peace was not achieved. 	"
"123",6366,"SOM",38,1983,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure  Sir  to extend to you my warm congratulations on your well-deserved election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.In your career as a diplomat you have shown excellent qualities of wisdom and statesmanship  and you come from a country which has always given strong support to the principle of collective security. I am sure that under your presidency the affairs of this session will receive wise and efficient guidance. I assure you of the co-operation of my delegation in the tasks that lie ahead.I thanks for this opportunity to express to Mr. Imre Hollai my delegation's appreciation of the competence and energy he displayed in directing the affairs of the thirty-seventh session.The Secretary-General has undertaken a number of personal initiatives to promote the peaceful resolution of conflicts. I wish to express here my admiration for the patient and constructive diplomacy that attended the use of his good offices and for his energetic execution of the complex tasks assigned to him.The deterioration in the world situation which has taken place since the last session of the General Assembly is  I am sure  a matter of grave concern to us all. The thirty-eighth session is taking place  regrettably  against a background of escalating regional conflicts and heightened world tension  and the outlook for the future is not promising. Indeed  looking ahead to the fifth decade of the existence of the United Nations  it is difficult to picture a world where international relations are based firmly on the principles of the Charter and on those equally important instruments that stem from the Charter.Certainly  as we examine the many questions on our agenda which deal with threats to peace and security  we cannot fail to note the wide gap which separates these issues from the solutions devised for them by the international community.I need hardly point out that United Nations efforts to end racism and colonialism in southern Africa continue to be thwarted; that the provisions of key resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council on Middle East questions are being deliberately pre-empted while turmoil and conflict remain chronic in the area; and that the call of the vast majority of Member States for the withdrawal of forces of occupation and military aggression in the Horn of Africa  western Asia  South-East Asia  southern Africa  the Middle East and other areas has gone unheeded.In these and other areas of the world the brutal suppression of the right to self-determination  independence and national sovereignty has led inevitably to instability and conflict.Pressing as these questions are  they pale into insignificance when we consider the threat of nuclear war which hangs over the world. It is a threat that will continue while the great Powers pursue the nuclear arms race and while the decisions of the special sessions on disarmament remain unimplemented.The potential for nuclear confrontation to cause dangerous and tragic incidents was graphically illustrated by the recent shooting down of the commercial airliner KAL flight 007  which resulted in the tragic loss of 269 innocent lives. This incident has justifiably caused worldwide concern. We hope that the response of the world community will lead to the strengthening of international arrangements for the safety of air travel and will help to ensure that a tragedy of this kind will never occur again.It is plain that we inhabit a dangerous world and this new and serious efforts must be made to make it a more safe and stable one. I believe that as a first step Member States must be prepared to put long-term global objectives before short-term interests.I turn now to southern African issues which have serious implications for international as well as for regional peace and security.South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia is not only defiance of the authority of the United Nations but a continuing cause of regional conflict. In our view  Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is the only valid basis for Namibian independence  and we believe the Council must take effective action to carry out its responsibilities towards the Namibian people.The world community has long condemned apartheid in South Africa as a crime against humanity. Today  in defence of that crime  the Pretoria regime uses increasingly brutal measures to crush internal opposition to its racist minority rule.My Government strongly supports the many General Assembly resolutions directed at the solution of the southern African problem  and we call on those States most closely involved to show the necessary political will to implement them.The Middle East is of course another area where principle and practice are far apart. Israel continues to ignore the prescriptions for a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian problem  and the effects of Israel's unwarranted invasion of Lebanon last year are still evident in the human suffering  the devastation of large areas and the fuelling of political instability.The General Assembly must call for the immediate withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Lebanon and must reaffirm Lebanon's internationally recognized borders. It must also demand withdrawal from occupied Arab lands  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly  and must continue its support for recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.It is a matter of profound regret to us that Iran and Iraq  two non-aligned States  have not been able to resolve their differences by peaceful means and that grievous loss of life and destruction of property continue to be suffered by both sides in the conflict between them. We hope Iraq and Iran will respond to the universally expressed desire that the fighting stop and that they engage in negotiations to bring about an honourable  just and enduring peace.The trend towards foreign military intervention in the affairs of States is of course one which runs counter to fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. These interventions inevitably lead to bitter civil wars  catastrophic refugee situations and regional instability and tension.In this context the world community must continue to demand an end to the occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. My Government supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about a political solution to this problem. We hope that such a solution will include the resolution of the tragic refugee problem in an honourable and humanitarian way  with the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan  to enable the Afghan people to decide on their future free from foreign interference.We regret that in Democratic Kampuchea too the aspirations of the people to national independence continue to be obstructed by foreign intervention and that this situation has escalated regional tensions. We hope that all the States concerned will enter into dialogue in order to ensure that the people of Kampuchea are enabled freely to elect a Government of their choice.Unfortunately  we must add the question of Chad to the list of cases of unwarranted and opportunist military interventions in the affairs of States. My Government hopes that Member States will call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of ail foreign troops from Chad and will demand that its territorial integrity be scrupulously respected.The festering problems of the Horn of Africa are of serious and pressing concern to my country. I believe they also deserve the close attention of the international community  because they destabilize our strategically important region and contribute to global tensions.There is of course a long history behind the endemic tension and conflict in the Horn of Africa  but I wish now to call particular attention to the latest manifestation of the region's deep-seated and dangerous problems.In July 1982 the Ethiopian army  supported by surrogate forces  invaded the territory of the Somali Democratic Republic by land and by air and captured the Somali townships of Goldogob and Balamballe  the latter some 32 km into Somali territory. They continue to occupy these townships to this day  despite the fact that the Ethiopian regime has been widely condemned by the international community for its aggression. That regime is attempting to undermine the sovereignty  territorial integrity and national independence of my country. Undoubtedly it feels able to carry out these aggressions because of the presence in Ethiopia of the military bases of a super-Power and of its surrogate troops.Ethiopia has continued its attempts to seize and occupy Somali territory. Only last July we were forced once again to defend our country in the face of a major onslaught on the settlements of Qabno and Mataban in the Hiran region of Somalia.We therefore call on Member States to condemn the Ethiopian regime for its aggression and to demand that Ethiopia withdraw its forces from Somali territory and put an end to its unwarranted attacks.A single issue underlies Ethiopia's current military adventures on our borders and the many other conflicts which trouble the Horn of Africa. That issue is Ethiopia's persistent denial of the right of self-determination to its colonized peoples in areas such as western Somalia  Abo  Eritrea and Tigray. These peoples are waging the same anti-colonial struggle as was successfully waged in the past by the majority of Members of the United Nations and which is still being waged in southern Africa. It is a struggle validated by resolution 1514 (XV) and by the progress from colonial status to nationhood achieved by a large proportion of the membership of the Assembly.The colonization of the Horn of Africa by the European Powers and by Ethiopia was carried out within the same period and as a result of collusion between theEuropean and the Ethiopian imperial States. It remains a curious anomaly that European colonialism is now a thing of the past in our region  but violence and bloodshed remain as the bitter fruit of Ethiopia's continuing colonial policies.The problems of our region are not caused by territorial or boundary disputes between States  but by the oppression of peoples seeking their inalienable rights.The denial of the right of self-determination to the captive nationalities in the prison State of Ethiopia by the Ethiopian regime and the policies of repression and genocide practiced by that regime against peoples struggling for their freedom and national independence have caused mass exoduses of refugees from Ethiopia into neighbouring countries.Somalia alone has at one time hosted more than 1.5 million persons in refugee camps. Their presence in our country has placed an intolerable burden on our fragile economy  despite the generous response by the international community to the need for emergency assistance. To date there remain more than 700 000 persons in refugee camps m Somalia  and a similar number eke out a living among the population throughout the country. Naturally  the refugee problem cries out for solution  since the generosity of my Government and that of the donors of aid is not unlimited. However  such a solution is not in sight in view of the continuation of the relentless policy of repression within the empire State of Ethiopia.On behalf of my Government I wish to reaffirm once again that Somalia has no territorial claims against any of its neighbours. We hope that the problems of the region will be settled by peaceful means in accordance with the Charter. We will  however  continue to exercise our right to defend ourselves against military aggression and we will continue to extend our determined support for the legitimate rights of those peoples that are suffering under alien domination in the Horn of Africa.I have already called attention to the troubling distance between United Nations resolutions and the political realities of our times. This distance is nowhere more apparent and nowhere more dangerous than in questions of disarmament  particularly the question of nuclear disarmament.The threat posed by nuclear arms to mankind's survival looms larger with every increase in nuclear arsenals and with every refinement of the capacity of the nuclear Powers to wreak destruction on each other and on the world. Scientists of international repute describe this situation as the triumph of irrationality. In the view of my Government  the General Assembly's continuing but so far unsuccessful call for a freeze m the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons  for a comprehensive test-ban treaty and for the prohibition of chemical weapons represents the voice of sanity.We believe that emphasis must now also be placed on preventing the spread of nuclear and other confrontations to outer space. The development of anti-satellite weapons would undoubtedly add a new destabilizing element to an already frightening nuclear balance of terror.The negative consequences of the arms race in nuclear and highly sophisticated conventional weapons are clearly discernible in the world today. Inflation  recession and the widening of the gap between the haves and have-nots have been followed by the squandering of immeasurable human  material and technological resources on weapons of destruction. In the political sphere States have become more vulnerable to intervention and interference  and tension and conflicts are on the increase in every part of the world.We appeal to the nuclear Powers to work with a new sense of urgency and a stronger political will to remove the threat of a nuclear holocaust from the globe and to promote the channelling of military resources towards the work of peace and progress.The establishment of zones of peace and nuclear- weapon-free zones is an important goal set by the tenth special session of the General Assembly. In our view  it continues to deserve the strong support of Member States. We deeply regret that only in Latin America has it been possible for this concept to receive practical implementation.My Government has always given strong support to the General Assembly's Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  and we fully endorse the provisions of the Final Document of the Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean.'"" We hope that all States concerned will work for the success of the long-delayed Conference on the Indian Ocean scheduled to take place in Sri Lanka in 1984. The Conference  in our view  must emphasize the need for the dismantling of all foreign bases  the withdrawal of all foreign forces as well as surrogate troops  the settling of regional disputes by peaceful means and the granting of the right to self determination to peoples under alien domination. These questions are particularly important because a dangerous incentive to increased super-Power rivalry and confrontation has been provided by the involvement of large numbers of Soviet and Cuban forces in local conflicts in the Horn of Africa and by the establishment of large-scale Soviet military and naval bases in the region  a development made possible through the collaboration of certain regional States.If we turn from the disarmament scene to that of the world economic situation  we find the same disappointing gap between principle and practice. In the current disarray of global economics and finance  it is hard to find evidence of the international consensus achieved in the General Assembly an the modalities for establishing a new and more just economic order. The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade recently  clearly showed the extent to which that consensus has been sidetracked.My Government regrets that there has not been a more favourable response from the developed countries to the call of the third world for a prompt and vigorous programme of development assistance  for easing debt burdens  for measures to ensure more just and stable commodity prices and for a rollback of protectionist policies.While my Government believes that the developing countries must indeed practice self-reliance and must strengthen technical co-operation among themselves  we also believe that the economic interdependence of the North and the South is an inescapable reality. In our view  both regions would benefit if the poorer countries were given the strong boost towards economic recovery which they desperately need.The steady and impressive record of achievements by the United Nations in the economic  social  technological and humanitarian fields is one hi which Member States can all take note. However  we cannot be complacent over the failure of the world Organization to come to grips with crucial matters involving world peace and security.I have expressed my concern over the Organization's chronic failure to carry out decisions which represent the collective wisdom of the international community. I believe this failure represents a crisis of authority for the United Nations. Undoubtedly  some of the bureaucratic proliferation and overlapping of resolutions needs to be trimmed  but this is a separate issue. It is secondary to the essential task of building an effective system of collective security for our interdependent world. In his current report on the work of the Organization [/4/3#/V]  the Secretary-General has again called attention to the crisis in the multinational approach to world affairs. He has rightly emphasized that the machinery of. International diplomacy must be made to move forward if we are to avoid chaos and disaster on a scale hitherto unknown.In this context  I heartily welcome the inclusion in the agenda of an item on the implementation of United Nations resolutions. It has the support of the non-aligned group  and I hope that constructive contributions will come from a wide variety of States. This item challenges us all to work with renewed dedication to make the world Organization a truly effective instrument for the maintenance of world peace and security."
"124",6403,"STP",38,1983,"ï»¿267.		When will the peoples of the third world emerge into the dawn of peace  security and well-being from the endless night of hunger  interference  wars and massacres?268.	The exacerbation of the principal world problems and the reappearance of tension in relations among States have led the Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe to follow with particular attention and great disquiet the escalation of the use of force as a preferred means of settling global conflicts and determining the future of mankind.269.	Furthermore  how can one not be sceptical of the statements of good intention made by those whose very actions gave rise to and maintain the hotbeds of tension in various regions of the world?270.	An analysis of the agenda for our deliberations reaffirms that view. Negotiated and definitive solutions through peaceful means of problems of extreme seriousness which are disturbing the international community are deferred in spite of the numerous relevant resolutions which have been adopted.271.	One wonders whether the United Nations is the dupe or victim of the rivalry of some of its Members.272.	Preserving the United Nations means preventing this forum  a chosen meeting place  from giving way to insincerity  ambiguity and cynicism in the discussion of the grave questions of the present. Preserving the United Nations also means respecting the hopes of the peoples  ensuring that its resolutions are implemented and using all our strength to overcome the symptoms of paralysis that threaten it.273.	If this is done Africa will no longer be a continent torn apart by deadly wars that turn it into a battlefield for external forces  by wars which cause famine  poverty  terror and desolation  by wars exported to shackle the firm determination of the African peoples to attain total liberation  the consolidation of their independence and their economic emancipation.274.	In the grim attempt to inflame Africa  the OAU has not been spared. On the contrary  every pretext has been used to make it ineffective.275.	The difficulties encountered in arranging the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of States and Government of the Organization of African Unity amply demonstrated the scope of the web of intrigues being woven around the OAU and the need for all its members to work to defend it while faithfully respecting the principles set forth in its charter. We note with deep concern the growing tendency to wish to neutralize in conflicts the beneficial role of the OAU in order to allow foreign Powers to act as they wish.276.	In central Africa  interference and the presence of foreign forces in Chad have hampered the praiseworthy efforts of the OAU and have delayed the attainment of the ideals of the people of Chad for peace and concord. We should like to reiterate here our appeal to the parties to the conflict for national reconciliation  which is the only way to end the calvary of the people of Chad  in order to allow them to get down to the work of national reconstruction with determination.277.	The People's Republic of Angola has been the victim of a three-year illegal occupation of part of its territory by the racist troops of Pretoria. The people of Angola are the target of criminal and constant bombings  the most recent results of which have to be added to the already long list of crimes denounced by that country in the  White Book of Aggression by the Racist Regime of South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola .278.	Given these barbarous actions  how can one describe the obstinacy of some countries in trying to gain acceptance for the unacceptable  namely  the establishment of a link between the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist forces in the peoplesâ Republic of Angola and the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)? The growing impunity of South Africa allows it to finance a group of stateless bandits  bloodthirsty mercenaries whose sole mission is to serve and safeguard neo-colonialist and imperialist interests in southern Africa. It is time for the international community to take more drastic measures to get rid of apartheid  which  in its daily repression  deprives man of the human dimension of his existence.279.	Our delegation highly appreciates the efforts made by the Secretary-General to carry out the mandate entrusted to him under Security Council resolution 532 (1983). The independence of the people of Namibia  under the leadership of SWAPO  its sole legitimate representative  is irreversible.280.	That same irreversibility is characteristic of the valiant struggle of the Saharan people. During the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government  at Addis Ababa  the participants adopted a resolution calling by name on the two parties to the conflict  the Kingdom of Morocco and POLISARIO  to engage in direct negotiations with a view to finding a definitive solution to this conflict	The failure of the meeting of the Implementation Committee illustrates Morocco's contempt for the sovereign decision of the heads of States and Government and constitutes yet another proof of its refusal to work to strengthen African unity and to promote the honour  dignity and freedom of the African peoples.281.	Last February in the historic and hospitable homeland of Gandhi and Nehru  the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries was held. Conscious of the manoeuvres to weaken the cohesion of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  more than 100 countries reaffirmed at New Delhi their faith and their commitment to the principles of non- alignment. In this world where prospects are so bleak for the future of the peoples of the third world  the Non- Aligned Movement remains a force for peace  justice and hope.282.	In Latin America  interference in internal affairs and acts of aggression and provocation have become the reprehensible practices of reactionary forces which are unable to accept the choice of peoples  in particular those of the central part of that region  to live in freedom and dignity.283.	The fate reserved by Indonesia for the people of East Timor must command the attention of the United Nations. The hope born of the meeting between the Indonesian authorities and FRETILIN  which augured a new and encouraging stage in the struggle for the liberation of the Maubere people  seems to be fading. The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe denounces the threats to land Indonesian troops and reaffirms its constant support for the fraternal people of East Timor.284.	Our support also goes to the people of Korea who have declared to the world their determination to reunify Korea without foreign interference.285.	What can be said about the question of Palestine which has not been said before? Those who think that through massacre and dispersion of the Palestinian people  by the breaking up of the PLO and by the disappearance of its heroic fighters they will succeed in striking from the annals of history the demonstration of one of the great injustices of our century are gravely mistaken. The Palestinian people will be victorious  and with their own hands they will build their sacred homeland  Palestine.286.	The danger looming over the people of Lebanon  that of seeing their national unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity flouted  is in contravention of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and furthermore is a threat to peace and security in that region.287.	I must add to this alarming picture the situation of the international economy  characterized by a sharp deterioration in the present economic system. The third world  dispossessed of its wealth  can only record failures in its attempts to establish a North-South dialogue. The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ended its work on a note of disappointment and uncertainty.288.	Given the hesitation of the industrialized countries to develop healthy co-operation with underdeveloped countries  it gives us great pleasure to note that South- South co-operation is intensifying  thus opening new prospects in relations between our States. The refusal of the industrialized countries to change the machinery of international trade has dramatically increased the indebtedness of the third world and has put off the establishment of a new international economic order.289.	There can no longer be any doubt that human speech has become one of the most ineffective tools of diplomacy  and this Organization should know this better than anyone. Lengthy monologues and dialogues aimed at diversion are multiplying and inevitably lead to a fear that the aspirations and sufferings of peoples will come up against the silence of words. How can we make words speak so that they awaken in the consciences of some a determination to halt  through constructive action  the machinery for devastation of the world?290.	The insanity and egoism of some are threatening the peaceful existence of millions of human beings. Is the sick desire to dominate so mindless that it can lead them to make bombs to destroy hunger and lead to the peace of graveyards? What can speeches do against bombs and the ills of underdevelopment?291.	On the other hand  the solidarity and commitment of the international community are capable of preserving the sacred rights of peoples to build their own progress in a climate of respect  understanding and human fraternity. Is this no more than a dream? "
"125",6435,"SUR",38,1983,"ï»¿102.	 It is my foremost duty to extend to you on behalf of my Government and people  and on my personal behalf  warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Panama and Suriname entertain excellent relations and we gratefully remember that in the beginning of this yearâa period which was crucial for my countryâyou personally received a delegation from Suriname and counselled us as a statesman and a friend. We shall never forget this. Your recognized statesmanship assures us of positive results at this session in the interest of peace and harmony.103.	May I at the same time pay tribute to Mr. Imre Hollai  who provided the thirty-seventh session with effective leadership.104.	We also wish to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General. His efficient stewardship of the United Nations and his skilful analysis and handling of several crisis situations deserve unqualified admiration.105.	As a member of the Latin American region  we take particular pleasure in welcoming Saint Christopher and Nevis to the family of nations. It is our hope that this new Member of the Organization will be successful in achieving its goals as an independent State.106.	Speaking on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Suriname at the general debate  I do so with feelings of both satisfaction and dismay. It is a source of satisfaction for the Government of my country to have the opportunity to address this august gathering of nations  to expound our view on the present state of affairs in relations among States  and to enlighten the members of the family of nations on developments in my country.107.	The mere convening of the General Assembly and the maximum attendance and participation of its Members  in spite of the strained relationship between individual States  create a renewed sense of hope for the effectiveness of the Organization as the main instrument for the maintenance of international peace.108.	By the same token  we are dismayed by the fact that  in spite of the presence of the Organization on the international scene for almost four decades  its lofty goal of creating an international order based on respect for international law and the peaceful settlement of disputes seems today to be as elusive as ever.109.	It is common knowledge  however  that this failure is not to be attributed primarily to institutional shortcomings of the Organization  but rather to the lack of the political will of its Members to use the Organization in the way envisaged by its founders and in the spirit in which it was conceived in the aftermath of a disastrous global conflict.110.	As the years have elapsed  there has been a growing tendency to lose sight of the goals and purposes of the Organization and the important role it was meant to play in the shaping of a world community based on human dignity  respect for the sovereignty of States  and the peaceful settlement of disputes. As a result  the world has not been spared conflicts during these decades  and al! of them have borne the potential of erupting into a global disaster.111.	Favouring all efforts to strengthen the authority of the United Nations through institutional changes  my Government holds the view that such changes will be successful only if paralleled by a change of attitude on- the part of its Members. In this respect  we cannot cease emphasizing that the role of the Security Council is to give effect to the system of collective security which the Charter provides for and for which there is no substitute if a peaceful and just world community is to be achieved. More specifically  we once again call upon the permanent members of the Security Council  which have been entrusted with special responsibilities  to live up to their duty.112.	The peril under which the world has lived for many years is as manifest today as it was one year ago when we met in this Hall. The use of force in international relations is threatening to become the instrument for the settlement of disputes among States and for the consolidation of the practice of powerful States of imposing their will on weaker nations.113.	In addition to the use of naked force against other States  we have come to witness a disquieting increase in the use of economic force against vulnerable nations  for the sole purpose of subjugating them to the economic and political interests of other States. Third world countries  like my own  with their fragile economies  which are the result of centuries of colonial exploitation  are becoming increasingly victimized by this practice  which moreover confronts them with almost insurmountable problems in fostering an economic development that takes account first and foremost of the interests of their peoples.114.	Undertaking this momentous task of generating economic development for the benefit of our peoples in a world order that is still characterized by an undemocratic distribution of political and economic power  therefore  requires courage and determination. It is almost four years since the people of my country undertook this task. During the past year we have continued to make steady progress in creating the conditions that are to secure the genuine and balanced development of our peopleâand this in spite of malicious opposition originating primarily from  and fed by  forces outside the country and fostered by a persistent denial of the legitimate aspirations of our people. These malicious activities manifest themselves in various forms of political  economic and military interference in the internal affairs of the country. It is these activities that pulled our country into an abyss of darkness at the end of last year.115.	From our traditional peacefulness as a people it can be understood how deeply afflicted we have been. It is this tradition of peacefulness and the national urge for reconciliation  as well as the awareness that our revolution is a just struggle  which at this stage have brought us together in greater unity than ever before and with a stronger determination than ever before to continue to realize the goals of liberation and progress which we set ourselves at the start of our revolution on 25 February 1980.116.	The objectives of our internal development process merely reflect the goals and aspirations of the underprivileged nations of the world  and the process in our country aims at achieving at the national level what the nations of the world are striving for at the global levelâ namely  a just society.117.	Our experience has been that there is a growing general appreciation that in our efforts to reach these goals we have been led by the spirit of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Therefore any attempt to attach controversial labels to the authentic process for the genuine economic liberation of our country from foreign interests will always remain fruitless.118.	The solid support and understanding that we have experienced on the continent  and the growing support and understanding that we are experiencing in the hemisphere and in the rest of the world  are important to overcoming the economic obstacles that are entailed in a process of liberation  in relation with which the accelerated realization of a new  functional democracy will be secured.119.	On the other hand  the continued denial of the legitimacy of the political and economic development process which our people has opted for unnecessarily stands in the way of the establishment of meaningful relations between nations in the interest of peace and development.120.	In that light  I cannot fail to make some observations with regard to our relations with the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The relationship between the two countries has been damaged by arbitrary and unilateral actions of the Dutch Government  actions that touch the very foundation of the structure of the international system and indeed  I venture to say  the very structure on which the United Nations is based. For the Organization is based on the honouring of agreements reached voluntarily between sovereign States. Not honoring treatiesâ action which the Kingdom of the Netherlands has taken towards the Republic of Surinameâmight therefore eventually affect the very essence of the Organization. To be sure  our people has resolutely and irreversibly terminated the colonial relationship of domination and exploitation with the Netherlands  but our people has also reached out unmistakably towards that country to establish modem and lasting relations based on mutual respect and benefit. It would be deplorable if a lack of a sense of reality were to impede the establishment of that relationship.121.	As I stated before  the present world order is characterized by inequality between States and it cannot be denied that this unjust system lies at the root of the many tensions between nations  with all their adverse influence on the international climate. Respect for sovereignty  the right of all peoples to self-determination in all its aspects and the principles of non-interference and non-intervention  which are so strongly advocated by the Non-Aligned Movement  to which my country belongs  should be the paramount and guiding principles governing relations among States. However  the powerful nations continue to display a disturbing inclination towards violation of those principles.122.	Our geographic situation makes us an integral part of both the Latin American and the Caribbean regions. We  therefore  fully share the anxieties of the peoples of those regions over the course of developments in Central America  where the turn of events deserves the close attention of the international community. The increase of tension in that region  which is due to the direct and indirect interference of outside Powers  has created a highly explosive situation with the potential for a serious and adverse impact on regional stability and international peace.123.	Increasingly  basic principles for the conduct of nations that are universally accepted and are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are violated by Members of the Organization. Our Government is of the opinion that the unnecessary display of naval force in that region by outside Powers cannot contribute in any way whatsoever to the solution of the problems in the region.124.	This unconcealed support by foreign Governments of subversive elements in order to destabilize legitimate and popularly supported Governments of other countries.mother example of disregard of the duty of all States j refrain from interfering in the international affairs of other States.125.	It is to be expected that States under the threat of being the victims of these hostile activities will find it necessary to maintain expensive defence capabilities against the threat to their national sovereignty and independence  which will result in increasing instability. My Government deplores the fact that an incorrect judgement of the causes that lie at the root of the instability in the region has created tension  as a result of which the region is on the verge of becoming the scene of prolonged conflict between opposing Power blocs.126.	The state of chronic social injustice which characterizes some societies in Central America is clearly the main source of internal instability in different countries of this region. Clearly  therefore  the solution of the problems of the region calls for a thorough restructuring of the social and economic relations within the countries affected by this crisis. Moreover  the pouring of vast amounts of arms into the region seriously impairs the ardent efforts of the Contadora Group to promote regional stability through dialogue  in the Latin American tradition of the peaceful settlement of differences between States. My Government remains supportive of these valuable initiatives of the Group and calls upon all States to assist in its efforts.127.	The Caribbean area has not escaped the consequences of the increased tension in our region. The prolonged activities of large-scale naval squadrons in the Caribbean  extending to the southernmost flank of the area bordering on my country  is a source of deep concern to our Government. The desire of the peoples of the Caribbean to live in peace and tranquillity  as is essential for their economic and social development  has been expressed on various occasions. Turning the Caribbean region into another scene of super-Power rivalry would only compound the problems of the States in the region  to the detriment of their peoples.128.	Among the many issues that figure on the agenda of this session there are some that offer disturbing illustrations of the failure of the international community  and the inability of the United Nations to deal effectively with situations even when these persist against all rules of international law and against humanity and the human conscience. A clear illustration is the situation in southern Africa. This area of the world is held captive in a reign of terror pursued by the racist regime of Pretoria  which remains unchecked by actions of the international community  causing deep suffering to the indigenous population in that country and in neighbouring States. Our Government expresses solidarity with the heroic freedom fighters in their struggle against the inhuman system of apartheid  and for their brethren in the neighbouring States who support them.129.	More than five years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  Namibia's independence is still withheld by Pretoria. We appreciate the renewed efforts by the Secretary-General to achieve the implementation of this resolution. In spite of the positive signs resulting from this initiative  we have to remain cautious regarding the intentions of Pretoria in the light of the experience with this Government in past years. Our Government remains committed to its support for the struggle of the Namibian people for freedom  independence and sovereignty.130.	The Middle East is embroiled in another cycle of violence unfolding on the territory of Lebanon. The current crisis in Lebanon is a direct result of the war waged in that country against the Palestinian people in another attempt to suppress its call for justice. It is clear  however  that violence cannot eradicate the legitimate aspiration of a people and its determination to live as a nation.131.	It is a fact that the Middle East will remain an area of turmoil and human suffering in the absence of a just settlement of the Palestinian question.132.	I have more than once stressed in my statement the significance that our Government attributes to the principle of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States. Therefore violation of this principle  wherever it occurs  remains a matter of concern for our Government. Consequently  we continue to support the efforts of the United Nations to end the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  and call on all nations to respect the independence and right to self-determination of these two non-aligned States.133.	The solution of the problems of the few hotbeds of tension to which I have confined myself and of the numerous other conflicts that threaten the future of our planet seems to remain out of our reach. The United Nations is expected to play an instrumental role in the search for their solution. The extent to which it will be successful largely depends on the international atmosphere. However  the international atmosphere  poisoned as it is at present by distrust among nations and growing hegemonistic tendencies  offers little hope for appreciable success.134.	In this respect we can refer to the fate of one of the major preoccupations of the Organization: the promotion of disarmament. The arms build-up is continuing at its usual pace. Far from disregarding the danger inherent in this activity for our physical survival  we are most disturbed by its heavy toll on the resources of our planet  particularly when the world economy is experiencing its worst crisis of recent decades.135.	Naturally  the injustice and inequality prevailing in international political relations are even more profoundly reflected in present international economic relations. The global recession  affecting the developing world so much more severely  validates this conclusion. Therefore  there will be no positive change in the economic situation as long as we are working with an economic order based on the historic domination of the South by the North  despite signs of revival in some industrialized countries.136.	Contrary to what would seem to be logical  given the growing interdependence of States  the majority of industrialized countries appear to prefer limited short- term benefits to the greater benefits to be gained from a restructured international economic system. In this respect  I would mention the fumbling of the continuing global negotiations and the results of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade.137.	The chaotic situation prevailing in international financial relations poses a serious threat to world recovery. Although the financial crisis has so far been managed in such a way that debt problems have been dealt with flexibly on a case-by-case basis  there is still no lasting solution to the worsening debt problem.138.	It can safely be said that in general the Bretton Woods institutions cannot adequately meet contemporary needs  since they are based on the realities of a past era. The Government of the Republic of Suriname therefore supports the proposal of the Committee for Development Planning to establish an group under the auspices of the United Nations to examine the full range of issues in the fields of development  money and financed139.	One of the victims of the present gloomy world economic situation is the funding mechanism of operational activities for development through the multilateral agencies. It is a fact of life for multilateral agencies today that they not only encounter difficulties in acquiring new allocations  but find it increasingly difficult to convert pledged amounts and contributions into actual funds. We call upon the major donors to accept the reality of an interdependent world  and to help find ways and means to resolve the development aid crisis.140.	It is in the interest of both groups  developed and developing countries  that every effort be made to strengthen genuine co-operation among all countries. In this respect we fully support the activities which have been undertaken by the developing countries within the context of the Caracas Programme of Action* to promote South-South co-operation. Trade possibilities on the subregional and regional levels  as in the context of economic co-operation among developing countries  can contribute to lessening dependence on the industrialized countries.141.	Having said this  we would emphasize that South- South co-operation is by no means intended to replace co-operation between the South and the North  nor does it relieve the latter from its responsibility towards the developing countries. Hence  we expect that during this session  despite the set-backs at Belgrade  a number of short-term programmes of measures for immediate action can be successfully negotiated. We cherish the hope that the necessary political climate will be created  so that all the important interrelated issues can be discussed in their proper context. 142.	I opened with an observation on my feelings of satisfaction and dismay. Having dealt with current relevant global problems  I am pleased that I can now  in concluding my address  call attention to the fact that one of the areas in which we have been successful is in the creation of conditions for the proper management of the sea resources for the common good of mankind. As one of the 125 members of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  we are committed to the completion of this matter  regardless of the problems entailed. Therefore  we look forward to the Secretary-General's progress report.143.	In the course of my statement I have touched upon many problems which are causing us concern  problems which not only threaten individual nations but also undermine the very essence of the world Organization. We can assure the Assembly that the Government of Suriname remains deeply committed to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to those on which the civilized conduct of nations is based.144.	In the past three years our Government has frequently been falsely accused of acts that would be incompatible with those basic rules. I hope  however  that I have made it clear that our Government  in striving to define and achieve our national goals  will continue to act as a faithful Member of our world Organization and will  therefore  fully respect its sacred principles. We sincerely hope that the growing understanding on the part of other nations of the crisis and problems we have had to weather will expand into lasting friendly relations between our country and all the other Members of the United Nations."
"126",6529,"SWE",38,1983,"ï»¿  Confrontation and suspicion characterize relations between the great Powers. They seek security in advanced weapons technology and in the threat of mutual destruction. They hold us in constant fear that their nuclear weapons may be put to use. One of the few gleams of light in the international situation is the recently concluded follow-up meeting at Madrid of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The result of the Madrid meeting can be the beginning of improved co-operation and greater understanding between the States of Europe  and between East and West. My country is honored to host the 1984 Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. We shall endeavor to make this Conference a stepping-stone in the arduous work of turning distrust into confidence and of reducing the risk of armed conflict in Europe  so that  in time  it may prove a valuable contribution to a disarmament process. The great Powers confrontation has impeded the solution of regional conflicts in the world. Tensions between the super-Powers have long hampered the ability of the United Nations to maintain peace and security. There is an increasing tendency among States to resort to force. Frequent violations of the borders and territorial integrity of States take place in disregard of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law. Nowhere can such actions be defended. Last autumn  a debate on the strengthening of the United Nations was initiated in the Assembly  largely inspired by the Secretary-General's clear-cut analysis of the Organization's problems. In the view of my Government  it is essential that this debate be continued. It should be pursued with the definite aim of producing constructive  realistic contributions to the solution of United Nations problems  thus strengthening the ability of the Organization to resolve conflicts. The five Nordic Governments have sought to make such a contribution in a joint study. As members of the Assembly  we must seriously consider whether the resolutions we adopt are likely to promote solutions of conflicts. We must avoid using the Assembly for shortsighted and tactical purposes. Political tensions must not be allowed to influence the role of the United Nations as a forum where all interested parties can take part in the discussions on equal terms. The results of the two international conferences recently held at Geneva are a source of encouragement in this context. The constructive co-operation in negotiations at the Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination was a definite step forward in comparison with the Conference in 1978. My Government also appreciated the spirit of co-operation and compromise shown by the participating States that led to the outcome of the International Conference on the Question of Palestine. The recommendations of that Conference merit serious consideration by the United Nations organs concerned. Our debate on the problems of the United Nations is particularly focused on the Security Council  which according to the Charter bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace. The privileged position of the great Powers in the Council places upon them a special responsibility for upholding the principles of the Charter and for the proper functioning of the Council Sweden regrets the inadequacies shown by the Council at present in following up its own resolutions and in dealing with conflicts in time to prevent violence  as well as its inclination to hand over difficult and sometimes impossible tasks to the Secretary-General without giving him the necessary support. In his recent report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General refers to the obligations of the Security Council and points out that threats to international peace are of such importance that they should override the differences of interest and ideology which separate the members of the Council. The significance of this cannot be over-emphasized. My Government welcomes the Secretary-General's intention to give priority in the coming year to an examination and appraisal of the administration of the Secretariat with a view to its improvement. The Secretary-General has questioned whether he still commands sufficient authority to meet effectively his responsibilities as chief administrative officer of the Organization. We share his concerns  but our answer is clear: the authority is there  vested in him  according to the Charter. Nowhere has the involvement of the United Nations been greater than in the Middle East. There have been important achievements  not least through the United Nations peace-keeping operations. Throughout the years  Sweden has taken part in these operations and in various mediation assignments. This year we are commemorating my countryman  Folke Bemadotte  who was murdered 35 years ago during his mission as a United Nations mediator in Palestine. We have been concerned and depressed to see how large-scale violence has broken out once again in Lebanon. Lebanon's sovereignty and independence must be respected  and all foreign forces remaining in the country contrary to the wishes of the Lebanese Government must be withdrawn. It is the sincere hope of the Swedish Government that the agreement just announced in Lebanon will mark the end of the violence and the beginning of constructive negotiations towards national reconciliation. The civilian population in Lebanon is suffering greatly from the chaotic situation in the country. Palestinian refugees also run the risk of new attacks. It should be the urgent duty of the United Nations to ensure the legal and physical protection of these refugees. The situation in the West Bank and Gaza is also cause for continuing concern. Israel's occupation policy  particularly its illegal settlements  is a serious impediment to a peaceful solution of the Middle East conflict. The conflict in the Middle East can be solved only if the legitimate right to self-determination of the Palestinian people is fulfilled  including the right  should it so wish  to form a state of its own in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel has a right to exist in peace within secure and recognized borders. The parties should meet in direct negotiations on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In these negotiations the PLO must be accepted as an equal party. It is high time that the great Powers restored the Security Council to its central role in the efforts to bring about a negotiated settlement of the Middle East conflict. South Africa persists in flouting united world opinion and international law in an unparalleled manner. In order to protect the repugnant social structure known as apartheid  South Africa continues its illegal occupation of Namibia and escalates its attacks and pressure on neighbouring States. For five years the negotiations on the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia  unanimously adopted by the Security Council  have regrettably come to serve as an argument against putting South Africa under the pressure of sanctions. My Government maintains that the Security Council should exert the pressure on South Africa which is necessary to ensure that the negotiations yield results. No country deserves more than South Africa to be subjected to sanctions as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan is now in its fourth year. Acts of war are continuing. Fundamental human rights are being constantly violated. More than 3 million Afghan refugees are waiting in vain to return. The occupation is particularly serious considering the position of the Soviet Union as a permanent member of the Security Council  which entails a special responsibility for the observance of the Charter. The talks in progress under United Nations auspices must continue and lead to the withdrawal of the Soviet troops and to the exercise by the Afghan people of their right to self-determination. There is a danger that the conflicts in Central America will turn into general war. In the present situation  the initiative taken by the countries of the Contadora Group stands out as particularly important in turning developments to another course and in strengthening efforts to find political solutions. Sweden supports the endeavors of the Contadora countries and finds it encouraging that more and more countries are becoming convinced that the path towards a solution of Central America's problems goes via negotiations and not via military escalation. The present situation in Central America has its roots primarily in the economic and social injustice in the region. The countries there must be given the opportunity of building up their societies in peace and in a state of national independence. A first step in reducing tensions must be the cessation of all deliveries of weapons  all arms traffic and all military assistance to and within the region. Ten years ago democracy was crushed in Chile. Since the military took power  the people have seen their conditions of living drastically deteriorate and have been deprived of their civil rights and liberties. However  the people of Chile have shown that they will no longer tolerate the suppression of their traditional freedom. Today  the dictatorship is shaken. In this crucial phase  the international community should continue to support efforts aiming at the restoration of democracy and respect for human rights in Chile. In my country's neighborhood  in Poland  we have seen the process of democratization being shattered. Without a real dialogue between different groups of the society a better future for the Polish people is hardly possible. The repeal of martial law last summer will therefore have to be followed by further measures in the same direction. It is 35 years since the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Along with the Charter and a number of international conventions  this morally binding Declaration lays down the rights of the individual which all States have the duty to respect. These documents provide the basis for the self-evident right and duty of the United Nations to engage in the protection of human rights. Violence between States often has a connection with violence within a State. The violence which consists of oppression of the individual by the authorities and machinery of government can become the root of international tension and conflicts. Efforts to safeguard human rights are part of the work for international peace. However  it is not primarily the risk of international tension which guides our involvement in efforts for human rights. Our interest is focused on the situation of the individual. Attention should be drawn to violations of these rights wherever they occur. It is gratifying to note that these problems have taken an increasingly central place in the activities of the United Nations. At the same time  we see that violations of human rights continue on a frightening scale throughout the world. We must find ways and means to improve the efforts of the United Nations in this field. Torture is a particularly abominable violation of human rights. I urge all States to play their part in the speedy realization of the convention to combat torture which the United Nations has so long been trying to finalize. I also appeal to all States to make financial contributions to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture  so that this Fund can effectively alleviate some of the great needs in this field. Some States are examined by the Assembly for violations of human rights. The Assembly's attention in these matters  however  leaves an impression of selectivity. My Government regrets this. In the Assembly we must not refrain from dealing with governments' violations of human rights when the conditions for doing so are at hand. No nation has escaped the effects of the international economic crisis. As always  the poorest countries are the hardest hit. The patient efforts of the United Nations have led only to a partial alleviation of their situation. There are signs today of an economic recovery. However  that recovery appears weak and uncertain. It is difficult to argue that any significant upswing is under way as long as unemployment continues to rise. At any rate  the recovery needs to be supported by a well-balanced and coordinated economic policy. A stable recovery of the world economy requires the involvement of the economies of the developing countries. This will not least necessitate increased financial support to and a greater solidarity with the developing countries  infer in order to reduce their debt burden. Economic growth in these countries is essential in itself  but it also serves to promote recovery in the industrialized countries. We are not lacking ideasâboth the Brandt and the Palme Commissions have presented guidelines for action. Sweden regrets that so far it has not been possible to start global negotiations within the framework of the North-South dialogue. However  the dialogue has not come to a standstill. The ministerial meeting of the GATT Contracting Parties in the autumn of 1982 laid the foundation for deepened co-operation in the field of international trade. A decision has been taken on a certain strengthening of the resources of IMF. Furthermore  the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has generated concrete results in some important issues and given impulses for continued practical work. It remains to be seen with what degree of determination Governments will follow up  in UNCTAD and other international organizations  the concrete decisions made. Sweden has adopted a programme of action to give substance to the follow-up of these common undertakings. The developing countries' readiness for dialogue and consensus must be met by a readiness of the industrialized countries for practical co-operation. In the Held of the environment  Sweden attaches significance to the efforts to reactivate and intensify international co-operation. This co-operation is vitally important to our common future well-being. My country gives its full support to the proposal for a special commission entrusted with the task of formulating long-term environment strategies which can contribute to a stable social and economic development. The overriding problem in today's world is nuclear weapons. Our entire existence is put in jeopardy. We must create the political conditions necessary to ensure that these weapons of mass destruction will never be used. The goal is a world free of nuclear weapons. One important step in this direction would be the introduction of a comprehensive ban on nuclear-weapon tests. The Assembly year after year has stated that a comprehensive test ban is a crucial measure in the efforts to halt the nuclear arms race. We attach the greatest importance to this issue. After very detailed preparatory work  Sweden therefore put a draft comprehensive test-ban treaty before this summer's session of the Committee on Disarmament. In the 1963 partial test-ban Treaty"" three of the nuclear-weapon States undertook to stop all nuclear- weapon tests and declared their determination to continue negotiations to this end. They confirmed that commitment in the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We find it deplorable that the nuclear-weapon States concerned have not fulfilled their commitments. We appeal to them to enter without delay into serious negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty. If they do not  this will also increase the risks of a proliferation of nuclear weapons. Peace and stability in different parts of the world will be endangered. The responsibility rests heavily on the nuclear-weapon States concerned. Achieving a test ban is a central element in the efforts that must be made to freeze nuclear-weapon arsenals at their present levels and to proceed to reductions. A freeze is not intended to alter the approximate parity that exists between the great Powers. Last year the Assembly called upon the Soviet Union and the United States to initiate a freeze on nuclear weapons immediately a call which both these Governments have so far ignored. This appeal is no less urgent today. Progress in the on-going negotiations at Geneva on the limitation of intermediate-range missiles in Europe would be an important step towards controlling the nuclear arms race. The Swedish Government believes that no further deployment of nuclear weapons should take place and that a substantial reduction should be made in the nuclear-weapon systems already in place. In this context a balance in conventional weapons must also be achieved at a lower level. The goal of parity should be sought at a lower  not a higher  level. For more than a generation the search for security in Europe has been guided by the concept of deterrence. The existence of nuclear weapons may have led to a degree of caution on the part of the two super-Powers in dealing with conflicts  but the doctrine of deterrence and its logical consequenceâthe accelerated arms raceâ have created insecurity and mutual suspicion. Suspicion heightens the risk of war breaking out by mistake or misunderstanding. This risk is increased by the rigid procedures automatically set in motion for protection against surprise nuclear attack. The Soviet shooting-down of a civilian airliner has been condemned by Sweden in the Security Council. This tragic incident is a reminder of how close we are to a situation in which the forces of destruction can be released. No sensible military or political goals can be achieved by using nuclear weapons. If they are used  the nuclear exchange that would follow would be virtually impossible to control and to limit. Yet a dangerous ambiguity remains about the role of nuclear weapons in military planning. Is their role only to deter their use by the opponent or will they be used in certain circumstances to redress a military situation? The technological development of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems  the continuous modernization of nuclear forces in Europe and elsewhere and their deployment in forward positions give the impression that limited nuclear warfare is considered a possibility. In the long run  nuclear deterrence offers very poor protection for mankind against the horrors of nuclear war. Other paths must be tried. One guideline must be respect for the security concerns and interests of the opposite party. States must realize that in the nuclear age the search for military superiority is futile. States must develop mutual understanding  confidence and co-operation across ideological and political barriers if the nuclear threat is to be removed. Those are the principles on which the concept of common security is based. It is particularly important to recall these principles at a time like this  when tensions have increased and the great Powers confront each other. Now more than ever there is a need for negotiation  for mediation and conciliation in order to settle conflicts. It is now  when the task is so difficult  that patient and determined efforts are needed. We should not let the great-Power confrontation overshadow the work of the entire international community. The general debate of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly should be seen in that light. In my view  this is a very important debate  for it will set the tone for the international dialogue in the months ahead. That tone may be one of increased confrontation  which means increased danger  but it can also be a tone that reflects an effort to transcend the ideological boundaries and to seek dialogue and detente.  This is our responsibility. I have the privilege of speaking from this rostrum on the first day of the general debate. Let me conclude by saying that as far as my Government is concerned we pledge to do our best to contribute to a constructive dialogue."
"127",6606,"SYC",38,1983,"ï»¿32.	On behalf of the Republic of Seychelles  I wish to convey to Mr. Jorge Illueca our warm congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. That important choice certainly represents a recognition of his noble qualities both as a man and as a diplomat. We wish him every success in the discharge of his duties.33.	I wish also to convey to Mr. Imre Hollai our deep appreciation of the admirable and far-sighted way in which he carried out his mandate as President of the thirty-seventh session.34.	I should like furthermore to express to the Secretary- General our highest appreciation of his tireless efforts in the search for the most appropriate solutions to the serious problems faced by the international community. I wish to pay him the highest tribute for his perseverance and courage in his many approaches to those who consider themselves to be directly concerned in sensitive situations in various parts of the world.35.	As a citizen of an island developing country  I am happy and proud to welcome to the Organization a brother island State  Saint Christopher and Nevis.36.	I wish to say immediately how much Seychelles appreciates the position taken by the United Nations with regard to the question of mercenaries. The United Nations  indeed  played an important role by severely condemning the armed intervention by mercenaries of which we were the victim in November 1981. Our national territory was attacked and our Republic violated. International conscience  represented by the Assembly  voiced a clear protest against that cruel action. Fortunately  the attempt failed  thanks to the vigilance of our people. The six mercenaries who were captured were tried according to our rules and procedures. Four of them were sentenced to death  but they were not executed. President France Albert Rene  in a magnanimous gesture  exercised his right of clemency. He pardoned them  which they certainly did not expect. That recent act of clemency formed part of an amnesty announced by the head of State during the celebration on 5 June 1983 of the anniversary of our revolution.37.	It is relevant to stress that this act was carried out at a time when throughout the world violence was pursuing its course. The fighters of the African National Congress	had just been hanged in South Africa despite international appeals for clemency. Wherever one finds oneselfâin Victoria or in New Yorkâone cannot fail to feel pity and anger at the injustice afflicting peoples which thirst for progress and freedom.38.	In our Republic  the forces of freedom prevail  and they guide our actions. Our abiding goal is to seek peace  not only in our own country but in our region of the Indian Ocean and throughout the world. The economic balance and the social progress of the world depend on peace among men and on security for all.39.	I have referred to the mercenary aggression against the young Republic of Seychelles because that criminal act teaches us certain lessons  for everything that comes to pass  even in a tiny island in the middle of the Indian Ocean  concerns people and must therefore be of concern to us all. Each one of us should share the burden of mankind's injustices. When the General Assembly decided to deal with the problem of this act of aggression  we felt that we were understood  that we were being helped and supported. I wish to emphasize that here.40.	Our world is a unit  and we are all interdependent. To survive  we need to co-operate and to help each other. A united front by all against every kind of aggression offers hope that our respective development goals will be met.41.	That is why we in Seychelles are fighting vigorously against military escalation of any kind.42.	Our Indian Ocean region must remain a sanctuary of peace: peace for the mammals of the sea  but also peace for human beings. We must not permit our ocean to become a place of confrontation for other Powers  not only because the arms race is harmful to us  but above all because we must banish from the face of the earth the very idea of aggressiveness. We  the peoples of the Indian Ocean  wish to live in peace in our region. However  we know that the geographical position of our islands makes them strategically desirable  that our freedom  our peace and our aspirations to prosperity are seriously threatened and that only international cooperation  acting to stabilize individual forces  can curb the military rivalries in our area.43.	There can be no more noble forum than this Assembly to undertake this endeavour for peace  which would be a reason for hope and an act of faith in the future.44.	The nuclear threat and excessive militarization must disappear from our Indian Ocean and from the face of the Earth. Unfortunately  the world is dominated by interests other than those of humanity at large  and all our hopes  all our attempts to achieve peace  have thus far been in vain.45.	I wish to voice our serious concern about the recent nuclear collaboration between certain Western Powers and South Africa.46.	The opposing parties constantly change  the conflicts move from one nation to another  alliance agreements are made and unmade. Our Indian Ocean region does not escape these constant threats  and that is why the Republic of Seychelles reaffirms its determination to work for the convening as soon as possible of the Conference on the Indian Ocean  which has repeatedly been postponed. We note with great regret that no mention of the Indian Ocean was made in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization.47.	Let us always remember that the nuclear risk involved in two countries confronting each other in fact constitutes a threat to mankind as a whole. It is therefore imperative to oppose the blind machinery of fatality with lucid analysis  courageous action and effective structures for international co-operation.48.	If a nuclear war can destroy men  it can also destroy what men needâfood. Famine is a serious scourge in our century and it is a paradox that we are unable to end it immediately. The enormous progress of agricultural technology should enable us to fight famine and wipe it from the face of the Earth. Since that is not the case  we must do our utmost to see that no more children die of hunger in our world. 49.	International co-operation should be a driving force of agricultural development so that all peoples can become self-sufficient in food. I would point out that the industrialized countries possess approximately half of all arable land and that only 11 per cent of funds is allocated to agricultural research. Those figures do not make very good sense  as we are all responsible people here and our task is to improve the well-being of mankind.50.	Another scourge that afflicts our world is the worldwide damage to our environment. The warning signs of this are the death of the forests  the rapid extinction of many types of trees  plants and animals  the pollution of our seas and oceans  and so forth.51.	Indeed  the question of the preservation of the environment has over the last decade gained considerable importance. It has become so important that several countries have made it the major topic of their electoral policies. In an unprecedented tide of action  119 countries  including the Republic of Seychelles  signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. That Convention provides the true foundation for international co-operation to protect the environment against any marine pollution.52.	Without further ado we must start to preserve the environment in all its aspects. According to an old proverb  the death of the forest is followed by the death of man. Unless we immediately implement a new policy for the rational management of the Earth's natural resources  the effects of environmental damage will harm future generations.53.	In his statement at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March 1983  the President of the Republic of Seychelles appealed for international co-operation for the preservation of the environment of the Indian Ocean and its natural resources. On that occasion the head of State of Seychelles spoke of an Indian Ocean alliance in which all the littoral countries of the Indian Ocean would take part.54.	The people of Seychelles is keenly aware of the fragility of the ecosystem of its territory and is striving to protect it at all costs. By defending and protecting the variety of species  it is our territory  our people  the riches of men and their freedom that we are defending. We have assumed this mission for the well-being of humanity.55.	That is why the people of Seychelles has  as it were  made available to humanity at large  through UNESCO  a third of its territory to be part of the world heritage. I am referring to the Aldabra Atoll  which is now one of a number of famous sites or monumentsânatural  historical or archaeological.  Humanity   by definition  involves all men. Any human venture  however particular it may appear  involves humanity as a whole  and the Aldabra venture is an example of this and represents an ideal. Aldabra has always represented peace and freedom  and its inclusion in the world heritage enshrines it as a symbol of peace and freedom.56.	I must recall the rending of the soul of Seychelles at the time of the separation of Aldabra in 1965  a rending caused by the creation of a new territory for a purpose that does not represent a quest for tranquillity. Diego Garcia  separated from Mauritius at the same time  remains today a military base ix our Indian Ocean.57.	How much ground has been covered since the 1960s  and fortunately for Aldabra  respect for nature has triumphed  peace reigns and freedom shines forth.58.	I repeat that we must protect the environment of the Indian Ocean region  which for us is a source of incalculable wealth. It is a question of the survival of our region. We have fought and we will continue to fight in international forums to demand that the super-Powers remove their rivalries from that region.59.	Today the world is facing other serious problems. One of the great dangers  which could lead to decisive confrontations in the future  lies in the increased gap between the poor countries and the industrialized countries. By the year 2000 the world population  according to the statistics of the experts  will be over 6 billion  of which three quarters will be living in the developing countries.60.	The famous North-South negotiations remain deadlocked. The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade  achieved mediocre results. None of the steps designed to tackle the most urgent issues requested at New Delhi by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries was taken at Belgrade. No commitment was made concerning transfers likely to lead to a recovery in the economic and social activities of certain countries that are heavily dependent on foreign capital markets and raw materials. It is high time that a policy of support for the prices of the raw materials of the poor countries was implemented. A policy of agricultural or food self-sufficiency is also necessary. Similarly  we believe that we must together find procedures for a new monetary system which does not introduce imbalances into the economies of the developing countries.61.	Another important sector that should be improved is that of the borrowing capacity  choice and facilities for developing countries  but borrowing opportunities and conditions have been analyzed and made more difficult and more scarce at the very time when the economies of many developing countries are expanding and need fresh sources of financing.62.	Since dangerous prospects are opening up  a new universal approach must prevail  as must boldness  imagination and  above all  determination. It is essential to meet the challenge of the poverty of the third world  not only out of a spirit of brotherhood or generosity but also because an expansion of trade is in the interest of the whole world  particularly the industrialized countries.63.	We are not asking the industrialized countries to sacrifice their legitimate interests  nor are we asking them to stop making their best efforts to ensure the well-being of their peoples. We are asking them to join us  to fight with us for a more humane development/with a view to establishing a new international economic order. We know that several industrialized countries are aware of the scourges that beset the countries of the third world and are convinced of the need to remedy them.64.	I should like to take this opportunity to thank all the countries that are working in this direction and all the countries that have confidence in the Republic of Seychelles and continue to make a meaningful contribution to the development of our young Republic.65.	The peoples of the third world have the right to development  to lifeâin short  to a future. But this future can be built only through economic co-operation based on dignity  human solidarity and brotherhood. If this cooperation is to be sound and successful  the economic structures put in place to maintain the developing countries in a situation of dependence must be eliminated. The time has come to practice a development policy based on dignity and justice. 66.	The United Nations system remains the essential tool for a peaceful transformation of international relations  the best instrument for promoting international cooperation on a basis of equality that will lead to the establishment of the new international economic order. Therefore economic co-operation among developing countries is indispensable. By its very nature and because it is so necessary  it depends on the determination of our countries to achieve collective self-sufficiency and play a dynamic role in lasting and mutually beneficial international co-operation on a basis of equality.67.	Without being a precondition of or a substitute for North-South relations  South-South co-operation  because of its great potential  necessitates specific collective action to strengthen its unity and solidarity. In this context we welcome the structures that the islands in the south-west of the Indian Ocean have established by creating a committee on the Indian Ocean for commercial  cultural  economic and technical co-operation. The initial results of the establishment of this committee have encouraged the legitimate aspirations of our States and can be considered the forerunners of new and greater prospects of regional co-operation among peoples and States of the Indian Ocean.68.	The future of a nation is not unpredictable. It is built on peace. But peace cannot prevail unless the basic principles of the Charter are respected: self-determination for peoples  independence and security for States  and dignity  justice and equality for individuals.69.	That is why we cannot fail to be aware of the need in the Middle East for the existence of a Palestinian State. We should not disguise this basic point by trite formulas  such as  the Palestinian question  and the  rights of the Palestinian people . Let us stop disguising the true question  which is self-determination for the Palestinian people.70.	In the Mediterranean  the policy and the principles of non-alignment of Cyprus must be respected  as must its territorial integrity.71.	In Korea  the Korean people is doing everything to restore national unity. We firmly support the struggle of the Korean people for the reunification of its country by peaceful means and without any foreign influence in its internal affairs.72.	In Chad  how much more loss of human life must there be before the people of Chad  which has been so sadly rent asunder by many years of war  can decide its own future? We stress the urgent need to find a lasting peaceful solution to this conflict within the framework of the Organization of African Unity.73.	In Central America  Nicaragua has become the scene of argument  but the facts show the strong determination of a people to defend its development and to struggle against oppression  domination and injustice. I repeat our sympathy and great friendship for the people of Nicaragua and its Government. At the same time  we wish every success to the Contadora initiative.74.	In EI Salvador  we are also witnessing a struggle for the triumph of a policy of economic and social change  whose fervour has been damped because the people cannot decide its own future.75.	The right of the Namibian people to freedom and dignity has suffered too much from constantly deferred time limits. Its martyrdom continues. Unfortunately  its will is still being frustrated  its decisions are being defied and its values are being outraged. It is time for the relevant resolutions of international organizations  in particular those of the United Nations  to be implemented so that the Namibian people can become free and independent. The presence of Cuban troops in Angola is no obstacle to this  in our opinion. The Namibian people will triumph  because its struggle is the struggle of all.76.	The struggle for national liberation also being waged by the courageous fighters of the ANC deserves and always receives our unqualified support.77.	The Saharan people  under the guidance of POLISARIO  is in a crucial phase of its struggle for independence and national sovereignty. It is with justified hope that we await the necessary political solution within the framework of the OAU  in co-operation with the United Nations.78.	The many attempts to destabilize fraternal countries must end. To curb the development of peoples towards their freedom is to hold up the progress of humanity as a whole.79.	Here I should like to mention the perseverance of Angola in its struggle and once more to assure the South West Africa People's Organization	of our complete  unqualified support.80.	While it is not for the Government of my country to say what is the solution to these political and social problems  we none the less believe that the best solutions should be found through peaceful dialogue. Violence is not the only way to resolve conflicts. The pardon granted by President Rene to the mercenaries who committed an act of aggression against our country is a clear example of that.81.	The General Assembly must be the pillar of the search for joint solutions. We must not be a passive body which merely takes note of international events. The United Nations attaches fundamental importance to respect for rights and freedoms  irrespective of sex  race  language or religion. Our ideas are guided by the fundamental principles of freedom  equity and the self- determination of peoples  international co-operation and non-interference in the internal affairs of all sovereign States.82.	That is why in Seychelles  under the high-minded guidance of President France Albert Reno  we are fervently struggling to implement all our principles because we are sure that they will lead to peace and the consolidation of international bases for security.83.	The Seychelles revolution is six years old. We have passed through a number of stages on our path to freedom. We are no longer a society that reserves privileges for a minority. There have been many achievements in education  health  agriculture  industry  fisheries  transport and housing. We can therefore look forward to a promising future in the economic and social development of the Republic of Seychelles. We know that we still have some way to go  but we are determined not to allow ourselves to be beaten by the obstacles that we shall have to confront.84.	The people of Seychelles  faithful to the goals that it has set itself and strengthened by its past experience  will continue to strive tirelessly for the consolidation of its revolutionary achievements  for the establishment of the necessary structures which will lead to its full development and strengthen its unity and national defence  and for building the foundations for a socialist society. In this respect  we know that we need support  and we also know that the General Assembly remains one of the essential structures for the success of our various peoples. With that success  we should be able to make a worthwhile contribution to world peace and security."
"128",6642,"SYR",38,1983,"ï»¿108.	 Mr. President  it is a pleasure for me to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  and I wish you every success in your task. At the same time  I should like to pay a tribute to Mr. Imre Hollai  the outgoing President  for his efforts  as well as to the Secretary-General for all that he has done during the past year.109.	I should also like to congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on its independence and its accession to membership in the United Nations.110.	The world today is facing serious dangers and is exposed to complex crises which jeopardize international peace and security. They threaten the detente and cooperation which followed the Second World War. Apart from the Palestine question and the Middle East problem  the occupation of Lebanon by Israeli troops  as well as the problems of South-East Asia  Namibia and southern Africa  fighting is raging in Central America and the Caribbean basin.111.	That state of tension in various regions of the world is accompanied by a failure to reach an agreement on strategic disarmament. The attempt to deploy missiles in Europe and other parts of the world is a grave set-back to international detente and has returned the world to an atmosphere of tension  heralding the re-institution of the cold war with its negative effects on the international situation and its direct threat of propelling the world into a new stage of direct confrontation among the great Powers.112.	It is imperative to point out  in particular  the world economic situation and its repercussions not only on the welfare of the peoples of the developed world  but also on the peoples of the third world that are suffering more than others because of their social and economic structures inherited from the colonialist eras. All that is bound to have grave consequences on the development of international life and the future of all nations of the world.113.	I should like to point out a number of major problems facing the peoples today.114.	Despite the United Nations resolutions on racism in southern Africa  on the question of Namibia and on the independence of the peoples of southern Africa  the racist regime still occupies Namibia  attacks Angola and Mozambique and threatens the African front-line States. The continuation of such a situation is not only a tragedy for the peoples of that region of the world  who have suffered during many centuries of injustice and oppression  but also an affront to the entire world. We stand by the side of the African peoples in their staunch struggle to bring down the racist regime and to achieve the independence of the peoples of southern Africa. Their struggle is part of the struggle of the third world for liberation  independence and sovereignty.115.	In another part of the world  the problem of Cyprus remains unsolved. That situation has led to the continuation of the suffering of the Cypriot people. It is therefore necessary to seek a quick and just solution of that issue  based on United Nations resolutions  through negotiations between the two Cypriot communities and on the basis of guaranteeing the unity of the island and its non-alignment. We hope that negotiations will continue under the auspices of the Secretary-General.116.	The Korean issue also remains unresolved. We support the unity of Korea and the implementation of the joint communiquÃ© signed by the two parts of the peninsula in 1972.117.	In Central America  threats against Nicaragua  Cuba and Grenada are escalating day by day as United States involvement continues to increase in that region  making the situation even more complex and posing the danger of a conflict that would have serious consequences for the international situation.118.	We support Nicaragua  Cuba and Grenada in their just struggle to maintain their national sovereignty and independence and ensure non-interference in their internal affairs.119.	The General Assembly is still considering an item concerning Afghanistan. We believe that the Afghan Government is entitled to defend the independence of Afghanistan against all kinds of outside intervention in its internal affairs. We have strong historical and cultural links with the Afghan people. Afghanistan is also a fellow member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  and we are anxious that it should remain so. The Afghan people have the right to choose its own system of government. Consequently  we attach a great deal of importance to the need to conduct negotiations between the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and its neighbours in order to achieve peaceful solutions that would guarantee the peace and security of that region and safeguard the unity  independence and non-alignment of Afghanistan.120.	In such a tense international situation  the Non- Aligned Movement represents an international approach seeking to realize peace  justice  progress  welfare and non-confrontation for all peoples of the world. The latest Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi  dealt with the international problems facing the world. It did so with a deep sense of responsibility towards the future of mankind and the right of the peoples to self-determination. The resolutions adopted at New Delhi constitute an important basis for maintaining international peace and security and keeping evolution of the international situation under control. The Conference also advanced proposals for dealing with the world economic situation.121.	However  the problem does not lie with that just and comprehensive approach of countries that constitute the great majority of the members of the international community. It rather lies with the intransigent attitude adopted by the forces of imperialism  injustice  racism and Zionism.122.	Among the most volatile and tense international problems is the situation in the Middle East. This is true because of the location of the area and its strategic  historic and economic importance. The unique characteristics of the Middle East have placed a heavy burden on it throughout history; it has been the object of colonialist designs for centuries. What is unfolding today in the region is but a modern version of past stages of development.123.	In the eleventh century the area was exposed to colonialist invasions called the Crusades. The Napoleonic expedition was another version  followed by frequent resort to military threats in the nineteenth century  especially during the events in Lebanon between the years 1840 and 1860. Western colonialism again reared its ugly head during the First World War  bringing to the region a scheme to seize Palestine and hand it over to the Zionist movement. A number of events followed  and the racist entity was created in that region  nurtured and supported by the United States and its Western allies. Because of that support in the military  political and economic fields  that entity was able to occupy Palestine and parts of Syria  Egypt and Lebanon.124.	The gravity of the situation in the Middle East region is due to the following reasons.125.	First  the usurpation of Palestine and parts of other Arab territories by the Zionist movement and the establishment of an entity based on racism  discrimination  despotism and domination  displaying an ideology that somehow linked the colonialist and expansionist objectives of the Zionist movement with mythical illusions to furnish a pretext for the brutal crimes that Israel has perpetrated and is still perpetrating in Palestine and the Arab territories exposed to aggression. The policy of displacement  annexation and alteration of the demographic structure in Palestine and the occupied Arab territories  as well as the violation of United Nations resolutions  the Charter and international law  and the foiling of all peace initiatives proposed through the United Nationsâall those policies and acts reflect the nature of the strategy of the Zionist movement and its aggressive and expansionist objectives and purposes.126.	Secondly  another reason for the explosive state of tension in the region is the renewal of greedy colonialist designs on the resources of the region and its strategic location. Our region's experiences in various historic eras are recurring today. The American and other aircraft carriers and warships are but a modem version of the colonialist expeditions and Crusades to which our Arab nation has been subjected at various stages of its history. We are confident that our Arab nation will defeat the new invaders  just as it has defeated all colonialist invasions throughout its long history. Nothing remains of those invasions but scattered ruins  which are visited by tourists who are the descendants of the previous invaders.127.	The American involvement in Lebanon and the direct interference of United States naval units in the civil war in support of one side represent a danger to the region and are a serious indication of the beginning of the ""Vietnamization"" of Lebanon. The United States Administration and its allies should read ancient and modern history  learn its lessons and cease to embroil their peoples and interests in wars of which they cannot be the winners.128.	We warn the United States Administration that the military involvement in the Middle East will prove as ill- fated as its involvement in Viet Nam. We remind its allies that have hastened to send their fleets and war-planes to that region that we threw them out the door following a long  bloody struggle  and we shall not give them the opportunity to return through the window. Let them be sure that through our determination and ability we have closed not just the doors  but also the windows  in the faces of the invaders. They can be sure that their aircraft- carriers and fleets will not intimidate us or weaken our determination to defend our land and future and exercise our right of self-defence.129.	The Atlantic m' '1ary presence in the Mediterranean is a challenge not only to us but to the entire international community  as it is a threat to security and peace. It is an expression of the rejuvenation of the aggressive colonialist spirit against the peoples and their right to self- determination  as well as against the peoples and Governments concerned. Our nation  which has defeated all invaders by its struggles and determination throughout history  will defeat the new invaders.130.	In talking about the ambitions of United States imperialism and some of the Western allies  it is imperative to point out the interrelation of the objectives  interests and ambitions of those forces and those of the Zionist entity  which they consider their eastern military flank and use as an advanced forward base. This explains the volume of military  political and economic aid extended to Israel.131.	The gravity of the situation results from Israel's aggressive intransigence  which is enjoying all-out support and backing from the United States. After proceeding to annex the Golan and embarking on a comprehensive programme of building settlements in the occupied territories  Israeli forces invaded Lebanon. The invasion of Lebanon has served aggressive expansionist Israeli interests. It is worth recalling here the memorandum submitted by Chaim Weizmann to the World Peace Conference in Versailles in 1919  in which he defined the political boundaries of Palestine  and not of the State of Israel. According to those proposed boundaries  the northern limit starts at a line near Sidon  crossing the eastern mountain range of Lebanon and passing through Syrian territories up to a particular point in those territories.132.	The invasion has also served United States interests within a strategic framework aimed at imposing United States hegemony on the Middle East region  but such hegemony can be imposed only by oppressing the peoples of the region.133.	The United States  as a super-Power  should have fulfilled its special responsibility for security and peace in the world and should have opposed the aggression and taking appropriate measures against Israel. Instead  however  together with Israel  it imposed  under the fire of aggression during the siege of Beirut  an agreement effected by the United States envoy  Mr. Philip Habib. Under the shadow of occupation and contrary to the Vienna accords and the Charter of the United Nations  the United States succeeded in imposing an agreement on Lebanon that threatens its national unity  violates its sovereignty  undermines its national independence  isolates it from its Arab nation and constitutes a threat to the security  the interests and the future of Syria and the Arab world.134.	There was manifest exploitation and evident blackmail in regard to the particularly painful situation suffered by the brotherly people of Lebanon because of the civil war and the national divisions imposed on them with a view to ensuring that Israel would gain as much as possible  regardless of the sufferings  the dangers and the damage inflicted on a United Nations Member State which has always been in the forefront of peace-loving States.135.	Despite the difficult situation in Lebanonâon which I do not wish to dwell  since there is no room here to discuss such issuesâthe Lebanese patriotic resistance confronted the Israeli occupation with great heroism  notwithstanding the difficult and complex circumstances our brothers in Lebanon are experiencing. The great majority of the Lebanese people also oppose the agreement imposed on Lebanon and do not recognize it. They have firmly declared that they will continue to oppose the agreement until it is dropped.136.	Our position on all these issues is clear and is based on the following principles. First  Lebanon's unity  independence and sovereignty are among the principles whose violation or infringement can never be accepted by Syria and the other Arab States. The Arab States will keep working towards that end and assisting the brotherly Lebanese people to recover their national unity and independence and sovereignty over all their territories. In this regard  we contributed to the achievement of the agreement concluded a few days ago between the opposing sides in the civil war in Lebanon. Secondly  Israel must withdraw unconditionally from Lebanon  in accordance with Security Council resolution 509 (1982). Thirdly  the agreement imposed on Lebanon must be overturned  since this agreement was imposed under the shadow of occupation. Any agreement imposed under occupation or through the use or threat of force is considered null and void. In this connection  it must be pointed out that no attempt of any kind to bring about the implementation of this ill-omened agreement can succeed. We shall stand by our people in Lebanon in their struggle until that agreement is thwarted. Fourthly  the multinational forces must leave Lebanon  because they have gone beyond their declared objectives and are posing a grave threat to peace and security in the region. They remind us of the colonialist expeditions in previous stages of the history of our region.137.	Despite this complex and grave situation  the Arabs have remained committed to the principle of establishing a just and comprehensive peace  based on and within the framework of the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations  because they appreciate the repercussions of such an explosive situation on world security and peace  inasmuch as they consider their peace and security part of the peace and security of the entire world. Appreciating their regional and international responsibility  the Arab heads of State  at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference  at Fez  approved a new peace initiative Israel  however  responded by rejecting it and by intensifying its aggression in the territories occupied in the war of 1967 and in Lebanon.138.	We believe that the attainment of a just peace requires fulfilment of the following conditions.139.	First  American involvement in the Middle East must cease. They must desist from the plans of hegemony aimed at controlling the resources of the region or its strategic location. The Arabs  who reject hegemony and aggression aimed at devouring their resources  likewise reject their resources' being used as a factor in the complication of the world economic situation  especially as they are willing to co-operate on an equal footing with all countries and peoples of the world. As they confronted colonialism in all its forms throughout their long history  the Arabs will also resist attempts to impose domination. As they are determined to keep their countries free  sovereign  independent and active in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  they equally reject subservience and alignment and the use of their countries as bases for aggression against other States and nations.140.	Secondly  a strategic balance must be maintained in the region between the parties to the conflict  since with military superiority the superior party would remain intransigent while the weaker party would become more adamant in its attitudes. In this respect we call on the United States to halt all types of aid and support to Israel  especially in the military field.141.	Thirdly  there must be a declaration of commitment to the Charter and to resolutions on the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East. This would mean that the Israelis should accept the following: total withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied in 1967; recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including their right to repatriation  self-determination  the establishment of their own independent State on their national soil  as well as the recognition of the PLO  their sole legitimate representative; and unconditional withdrawal from Lebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution 509 (1982).142.	These conditions constitute the basic prerequisite for halting the further deterioration of the situation  lest there come a time when it gets out of control  with all the serious implications that may entail not only in the region but also in the world as a whole.143.	Any survey of Israel's history of aggression would show it to be replete with all kinds of crime and violations of the Charter and United Nations resolutions. I do not wish to dwell on the resolutions which Israel has violated  rejected or refused to recognize  but I must raise again the question we have raised in previous sessions  namely  that of sanctions against this Member State  one of whose basic characteristics has become violation of the Charter and continuous use of force and aggression.144.	Therefore  once again we raise the following two issues: Israel's membership in the world Organization  following its violation of its own commitments undertaken at the time of its admission to the United Nations and the decision that Israel should abide by the Charter and by resolution 273 (III)  adopted by the General Assembly in 1949; and secondly  the imposition of sanctions by the Member States against this Member  which has become an odd  unique phenomenon in international life  no less infamous than the Nazi phenomenon.145.	The gravity of the situation in our region  with all the dangers of increased involvement by the United States and some of its allies  makes it incumbent upon the world Organization to take decisive positions  not only in the interests of security and of Member States  but also to safeguard the security and the interests of all countries in the world.146.	We shall remain loyal to the Organization's Charter and resolutions. This loyalty to the Charter and our commitment to international peace and security make it imperative for us always to use our legitimate right to self-defence to protect our interests  the independence of our countries and our national sovereignty. 155. We call upon all States and peoples of the world to realize the seriousness of the situation and to stand by our side  for ours is the cause of right and justice.."
"129",6687,"TCD",38,1983,"ï»¿186.	 My first words will be words of congratulations  on behalf of my delegation  to the President of the General Assembly on his election. By this election the current session has paid a tribute not only to his experience in international affairs but also to his country  Panama  and its commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. His profound knowledge of the United Nations system  I am convinced  makes him capable of carrying out the delicate responsibility he has assumed. He has our wishes for complete success in carrying out his important mission.187.	He is following in the footsteps of Mr. Hollai  whose tact; competence  authority and devotion have made a strong impact in this period of renewed tension in the world. My delegation much appreciated the way in which he guided the proceedings of the thirty-seventh session and we express here our sincere thanks to him.188.	It is also a pleasure for me to pay a deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  who has spared no effort to serve the cause of peace and justice in this disturbed world. We are much indebted to him.189.	Finally  my delegation warmly congratulates Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission as the 158th Member of the Organization.190.	The thirty-eighth session is opening at a difficult time  in which the international climate  already tense  has been shaken in recent weeks by the incident of the South Korean Boeing aircraft  in which innocent travelers were the victims of a clear violation of the elementary rules of civil aviation. 191.	The international community is increasingly faced with numerous problems whose seriousness threatens the very survival of mankind.192.	These problems  which are both political and socio-economic  are a result of the unbridled arms race  the resurgence of the cold war and the difficulty of establishing a true dialogue between North and South.193.	In the economic field the world is experiencing a serious crisis characterized essentially by rampant inflation  a constantly increasing rate of unemployment  heavier indebtedness  a slowing down of production  an increase in protectionism and a shortage of financial means.194.	The imbalance in international economic relations and the interest rate policy applied by certain countries to revive their economic activities explain the situation  which has serious repercussions for the developing countries.195.	The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which had aroused great hopes  did not yield the desired results. The wealthy countries once again maintained their usual positions  thus preventing the adoption of specific measures.196.	We consider essential the establishment of a new international economic order that is more just and equitable  leading to a restructuring of production  exchange and control by each country concerning the use of its own resources.197.	The present economic crisis  which constantly widens the gap between the developing and the developed countries  is not only a source of instability but also a threat to peace and security in the world. Peace and development are linked  and that is why my delegation urges an early start to global negotiations directed towards specific measures dealing with the principal problems of international co-operation.198.	In the political field  numerous upheavals characterize our era  and no continent has escaped the current worsening of the international political climate.199.	In the Middle East the situation  which still gives rise to concern  requires an urgent political solution which would enable peace to be restored in the region.200.	We earnestly hope for an end to the war between Iraq and Iran  two neighbouring and fraternal countries.201.	With regard to the Palestinian problem  we think that the people of the region must live in peace  and that implies the creation of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State under the leadership of the PLO  its sole representative  and also recognition of the right of Israel to exist.202.	With regard to Lebanon  my delegation welcomes the cease-fire which took effect in recent weeks in that country  and we earnestly hope that the foreign troops stationed there will withdraw in accordance with the wishes expressed by the sovereign Government of Lebanon.203.	In Asia  the occupation of Afghanistan and of Democratic Kampuchea by foreign forces must cease  so that those peoples can freely choose their own destiny.204.	With regard to the Korean question  a solution must be found without foreign interference and in keeping with the principles of reunification accepted by the parties concerned.205.	In Central America  tension has increased to a disturbing degree  and only a political solution can remove the clearly explosive dangers and create a climate of detente and of peace in that region.206.	In Africa  flash-points persist and are spreading.207.	According to the United Nations plan  as contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  Namibia should have attained independence in 1978. However  it must be noted that  through its delaying tactics  South Africa has impeded the transfer of authority to the Namibian people in spite of the readiness of SWAPO to negotiate. Besides continuing its occupation and illegal administration of Namibia  South Africa continues to carry out criminal actions against the front-line countries and illegally to occupy part of the territory of Angola.208.	The recent demands by South Africa  linking the Namibian problem to questions which come essentially under Angola's sovereignty  testify once again to Pretoria's stubborn refusal to consent to a procedure for rapid settlement of the Namibian question.209.	Our brothers in South Africa are each day enduring the humiliations of the apartheid regime  which tramples the most elementary human rights. The international community must contribute decisively to the total elimination of this anachronistic system and thwart any actions that might permit South Africa to continue its policy of denying fundamental freedoms and justice to the blacks.210.	The spectre of a nuclear holocaust continues to haunt mankind  and each day we expect our planet to be blown up. The nuclear Powers must commit themselves resolutely to the path of peace and work for true disarmament. The different negotiations under way between the nuclear super-Powersâin particular the negotiations concerning strategic weapons and intermediate-range nuclear weaponsâdeserve to be encouraged so that they may produce positive results.211.	In this disturbed world  where the law of the jungle tends increasingly to prevail  the United Nations must fully discharge its own functions.212.	My country  Chad  which is aware of its own weakness  sincerely believes in the United Nations as a moral and legal force safeguarding the maintenance of international peace and security.213.	Unfortunately  we note with regret that the main organ of the United Nations entrusted with the maintenance of peace and security in the worldâI am referring to the Security Councilâis blocked in its operations. Indeed  the Security Council today has been reduced to a state where it is incapable of responding adequately to a situation which requires it to act. Chad has had the bitter experience of this paralysis of the Security Council  which  it must be said  is the victim of ideological divisions and conflicts of interest. This state of affairs is made worse by the lack of coherence within the group of non-aligned countries with regard to promoting the principles of its own movement in the Council. The inability of the Council to take a clear stand on the Libyan aggression against my country must lead us to think seriously about strengthening the capacity of the Organization to deal with the problems it faces  in line with the proposals made by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization in 1982.214.	I should like now to speak to the General Assembly about the extremely serious situation prevailing in my country. I have no intention of going back over what my people have had to endure in their 20 years of martyrdom in Chad. My delegation spoke at great length about that at the thirty-seventh session and again this year in the Security Council. Today our intention is rather to inform the Assembly about the most recent developments in the tragic train of events caused by the open and unprovoked aggression of Libya against Chad. I am speaking to the Assembly about this with a heavy heart  but I do so without passion  without hatred and without rancour.215.	In defiance of all principles of international law  in particular the Charter of the United Nations and that of the OAU  Libya  with the help of foreign military experts and advisers  is occupying one half of the territory of Chad  some 550 000 square kilometers. In an effort to extend its occupation of the territory of my country  Libya has deployed its most sophisticated military weapons and has used fragmentation bombs  napalm bombs and phosphorus bombs on the villages and cities of Faya-Largeau  Oum-Chalouba and Kalait  killing or wounding many innocent people.216.	This situation would have been avoided if the international community had heeded the appeals of the Government of Chad  which repeatedly drew attention to intensive preparations by Libya to perpetuate its occupation in Chad  at Managua  at New Delhi  at Buenos Aires and at Addis Ababa  during the meetings of the Non-Aligned Movement  the Group of 77 and the OAU.217.	Similarly  the Government of Chad last March informed the Security Council about the situation  and at the conclusion of its meetings  the Security Council issued a statement on 6 April 1983appealing to both parties to make use of the mechanism available within the OAU for the peaceful settlement of disputes  including the Good Offices Committee established by the continental organization. This statement also invited the two parties to abstain from any action which could aggravate the situation. In defiance of this appeal  Libya increased its military presence in both the occupied area and the border region  and launched its war of aggression against Chad.218.	In keeping with that same statement  the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  at its nineteenth session  unanimously adopted a resolution inviting the two parties to co-operate  fully and sincerely  with the Ad hoc Committee in seeking a peaceful solution to the Chad-Libyan dispute.219.	During the months of July and August  the Government of Chad regularly kept the President of the Security Council and the Acting President of the OAU Assembly informed of the deterioration in the military situation and asked the Council to do everything possible to get Libya to stop its barbaric aggression against Chad. Similarly  the President of the Republic of Chad asked the Acting President of the Assembly  in a letter dated 16 May 1983  to convene an emergency meeting of theCommittee on the Chad-Libyan dispute.220.	Faced with the refusal of Libya to implement the recommendation contained in the statement of the Council and the resolution of the Assembly  and in view of its determination to continue its aggression against Chad  the Government again asked the Security Council  in August 1983  to study the situation.221.	Moreover  convinced of the justice of its cause  and in keeping with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and with Security Council resolution 387 (1976)  the Government of Chad made an urgent appeal to the international community and to friendly countries to help it preserve its independence  its sovereignty  its territorial integrity and its dignity. Brotherly and friendly countries responded favourably to this appeal. I am referring in particular to Zaire and France. We take this opportunity to repeat to them our deepest thanks and our whole-hearted gratitude.222.	At the very moment that I am speaking to the Assembly  the regular Libyan army  the Islamic Legion created by Qaddafi to destabilize our region  and the mercenaries of all nationalities recruited by Tripoli's strong man  as well as Soviet and other military experts  are stationed on the territory of the Republic of Chad  more specifically in Faya-Largeau  Fada  Ounianga Kebir  Ogui and in the region of Aouzou. Each day the occupation troops are being reinforced. Several companies of tanks and armored vehicles and several infantry battalions equipped with a sophisticated anti-aircraft system are at this moment on the soil of Chad.223.	Libya is militarily occupying half of Chad. It is systematically destroying the palm groves which are the sole resources of that region  as well as the socio-economic infrastructures there. Libyan troops are robbing and pillaging the defenseless civilian populations  and carrying them off to unknown destinations. These practices are curiously reminiscent of the terrible era of nazism.224.	The occupation of the north of Chad by Libya is an aggression which outrages the conscience of the world. It is of course blocking Chad's development.225.	In spite of this permanent state of war imposed by Libya on our martyred people  for the past year they have been striving tirelessly to rebuild their country. Indeed  in spite of the many practical difficulties  the administrative machinery has been put back into operation; primary schools and secondary schools are open  and the students took their normal examinations at the end of the year throughout our country; health services are functioning; the food situation of the population has improved. In addition  the damaged economy of the country is now beginning to show signs of recovery  slight  but encouraging; the companies and corporations  whose operations were so long disrupted  are resuming their activities; the internal and external trade channels have been re-established; and  finally  urban and road construction  long interrupted  has been resumed.226.	Our own efforts at reconstruction and rehabilitation have been supplemented  in a strong expression of solidarity  by valuable assistance from friendly countries and from international organizations which have been kind enough to respond positively to the appeal made by the Government. Thus  at the International Conference on Assistance to Chad  held on 29 and 30 November 1982 at Geneva  the countries and organizations present there made commitments to assist in the financing of projects provided for in our plan for restoring social and economic activities.227.	To these countries and organizations which were kind enough to show their solidarity with the people of Chad  we again express our profound gratitude on behalf of the Government and people of Chad  and we urge them to continue their help. It is also a pleasure for us to express  on behalf of the Government and people of Chad  our deep gratitude to the Secretary-General and to the entire United Nations system for their laudable efforts for Chad.228.	Fraternal friendship and co-operation with the countries of the world  in particular with neighbouring countries  have always occupied a special place in the foreign policy of the Government of Chad. The Basic Law of the Republic governing State institutions in Chad assigns to the Government  inter alia  the task of pursuing a foreign policy of friendship  co-operation and peaceful coexistence  based on respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and that of the OAU  and for those of the Non-Aligned Movement. 229.	This policy is what led Mr. Hissein Habre  President of the Republic and head of State  to make friendly visits to and hold discussions with several African countries  especially our neighbours. It was this dynamism for peace that permitted Chad and Nigeria to find a peaceful solution to the unfortunate incidents in the islands of Lake Chad. This same political will also made it possible to reactivate the joint committees established by Chad with the Central African Republic and with Cameroon.230.	But this policy of friendship  brotherhood  cooperation and good-neighbourliness has run up against the hegemonism and expansionism of Libya. The regime of that country consistently threatens the right to independence and sovereignty of Chad and its very existence as a State.231.	In spite of the negative and arrogant attitude of Libya  the Government of Chad has always sought a peaceful settlement of the conflict between Chad and that country. Thus in February 1983 direct contacts took place at N'Djamena and at Tripoli. Discussions were embarked upon in both Chad and Libya between the delegations of the two countries. During these talks  however  Libya  faithful to its practice of expansionism and domination^ attempted to impose its diktat on the Government and people of Chad.232.	For Libya  the solution and success of the negotiations are subject to the following three conditions: the proclamation of an Islamic Arab republic in Chad  inspired by the Green Book; the formation of a strategic alliance between Chad and Libya in order to destabilize neighbouring countries; and recognition by Chad of the ""historical borders"" between the two countries. These unacceptable conditions are aimed at nothing more or less than legitimizing the occupation of a part of our country and  eventually  the outright annexation of Chad.233.	Understandably  the Government of Chad rejected and continues to reject categorically these pre-conditions  which are in keeping with neither the will of the people of Chad  nor the realities of our country. What is certain is that we will not permit  now or ever  any partition of Chad  much less its annexation. We shall do everything in our power to preserve the territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty of Chad and the dignity of its people.234.	With regard to reconciliation between the people of Chad  it is appropriate to recall that the day following 7 June 1982 the new Government increased the initiatives with regard to all the people without exception  for the purpose of ending the fratricidal war and reaching a compromise through dialogue. Indeed  direct and indirect contacts were established both within the countryâI am referring to Guelendeng  Bongor  Bousso and Keloâ and outsideâMaiduguri in Nigeria  and Kousserie and Maroua in Cameroon. Individual letters were addressed to the heads of the opposition in the pay of the Tripoli Government. In view of the refusal of those opposition leaders  the Chad authorities asked for the assistance of friendly countries. Thus  at the invitation of President Omar Bongo of Gabon  President Hissein Habr6 met the opposition leaders on 10 and 11 July in order to lay the foundation for national reconciliation. Again upon the initiative of the President of Gabon  the head of State of Chad had other discussions with them on 10 August 1982. Unfortunately  neither our efforts nor those of the friendly heads of State had concrete results  Libya having enrolled mercenaries of all nationalities to invade Chad.235.	The failure of the Libreville and Franceville talks in Gabon did not in any way weaken the consistent will of the Chad authorities to achieve peace and harmony. Thus  at the time of his inauguration  Mr. Hissein Habr6 made an appeal for national reconciliation in these terms:""I once again appeal to the patriotism of all the sons of Chad who are elsewhere to return to their country. The security of their persons and of their goods is guaranteed. They have their place in this country  which is their homeland.""236.	Palpable proof of the desire for peace of the authorities was the proclamation on 16 June 1983 of a general and total amnesty. Thanks to this clemency  prisoners were freed. Moreover  thousands of persons who were refugees abroad responded positively to the hand of brotherhood and peace held out to them and returned home. For the minority who are playing the Libyan game  this hand is still extended to them.237.	In conclusion  I would like to leave with representatives these thoughts of the head of State of Chad:""Chad is a nation and a State like most of the nations and States in the world. Chad is the product of history  like many other States. There is no State  no nation  in the world that was borne ay apartheid that has always existed as a nation and a State. States and nations are the product of history and Chad is no exception to this rule.""238.	Chad is today the victim of open aggression on the part of Libya  in flagrant violation of the Principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Charters of the OAU and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The martyred people of Chad are peaceful people  who aspire only to peace and greater well-being  like all the peoples of the world.239.	Libya is responsible for loss of life among the peaceful population of Chad  for the poverty and for the systematic obstruction of the socio-economic rehabilitation of Chad. Libya is responsible for the massive destruction of the Chad patrimony.240.	We are convinced that once peace has been regained and consolidated and national unity strengthened  the people of Chad will be able to devote themselves entirely and totally to the work of the reconstruction and restoration of their country  which has been destroyed by almost 20 years of war.241.	Therefore  we call on the international community  in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations  to help Chad regain its dignity  territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty  making Qaddafi's Libya see reason  cease its acts of aggression and intervention in our internal affairs and withdraw forthwith from Chad its invasion and occupation forces.242.	Chad wishes to live in peace within its internationally recognized borders. Chad wishes to live on good terms with all its neighbours. In spite of the barbaric and unacceptable actions of Libya  the Government of Chad is ever open to and ready for a dialogue on the peaceful settlement of this conflict.243.	In this regard  we welcome the total support of the European Parliament for the efforts of the Government of Chad to restore peace in Chad  so that we can get on with the work of reconstructing our country.244.	Once again  faced with the typical barbaric aggression of Libya and its illegal occupation  we urgently appeal to the United Nations as the guarantor of the maintenance of international peace and security fully to shoulder responsibilities in this serious situation existing between Chad and Libya  which could extend to the entire subregion.

"130",6733,"TGO",38,1983,"ï»¿131.	 The world in which we live is characterized by the contempt of some Powers for fundamental human rights and the rights of peoples. Intolerance reigns everywhere and the arrogance of some nations makes us ponder on the true meaning of mankind's very existence.132.	In that context  I am particularly pleased to congratulate the President on his election to preside over the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  which opened a few days ago. His country  Panama  is rightly famous for its isthmus  a bridge between North America and Latin America. We believe that as President he will be the bridge between the various opinions held at the United Nations and that he will synthesize positively the diversity of positions in order to reach compromises satisfactory to the international community. Therefore  we have no doubt that under his guidance  with the legendary wisdom of his country combined with his qualities as an experienced diplomat and statesman  we are assured of the session's success.133.	I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Imre Hollai  who guided the work of the thirty-seventh session with competence  moderation and a spirit of reasonableness.134.	I wish also to convey the warm congratulations of Togo to the Secretary-General on all his ceaseless efforts to maintain peace throughout the world. These are all the more to his credit since the end of the century is characterized by a reign of intolerance. All those who  like him  seek at such a troubled time in our history to have the voice of peace and wisdom heard deserve our gratitude.135.	The delegation of Togo also warmly congratulates Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission as the 158th member of the Organization. In doing so  we hope that this young State will make its contribution to our joint quest for world peace  security and prosperity. To this end  I can assure it of the complete readiness of the Government and people of Togo to co-operate with it.136.	Intolerance of  and contempt for  human rights and the rights of peoples have characterized the whole period since the beginning of the thirty-seventh session. Throughout the world we are witnessing acts of violence to such an extent that we wonder whether the last quarter of the century has been struck by the demon of hate or of intolerance. If we are not living in a reign of contempt for human rights and the rights of peoples  how can we explain the cold-blooded shooting down by Soviet air forces of the Korean Air Lines Boeing 747  with 269 innocent people on board? Ten years ago a Boeing 707 of Libyan Air Lines was shot down in a cowardly manner in similar circumstances by Israeli air forces. This reveals the same contempt for fundamental human rights and the rights of peoples. What is most disturbing is the silence maintained on all sides in the face of these barbaric acts and the fact that  faced with these tragic events  even the Security Council is lost for words and takes no decision. The paralysis of the supreme body of the United Nations  if it were repeated  would cause serious concern to the smallest nations  which need the Organization's protection.137.	For what would be the fate of human rights and the rights of peoples if States  taking advantage of the power that they possess at a given time  subjugated other peoples  with contempt for all morality? Unfortunately  this contempt for fundamental human rights and the rights of peoples now prevails everywhere: in the Middle East  in Afghanistan  in Korea  in Democratic Kampuchea  in southern Africaâparticularly Namibiaâand in the Western Sahara.138.	The OAU  created 20 years ago  put on its political programme the liberation of Africa from the colonial yoke. Twenty years later we know that  unhappily  there is still one country  South Africa  which continues in Namibia to defy the international community and to flout fundamental human rights with its policy ofRacism in South Africa is still raised to the level of a political system; segregation is unashamedly common currency. Faced with intolerance  the people of South Africa has no other choice than to organize under the banner of the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress. Pretoria answers all the legitimate claims of the people of Azania with summary executions  mass imprisonment and blind repression. Are the peoples of Africa indignant  faced with such barbaric actions by the Pretoria Government? That Government's only answer is to bomb the front-line countries and to show a revolting arrogance in the face of unanimous condemnation by international public opinion. But sooner or later the peoples of Azania  with the support of peace-loving people throughout the world  will put an end to the apartheid regime  and South Africa will become a multiracial society in which tolerance will at last become the law.139.	In Namibia  SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  is courageously waging a struggle for liberation. Our Organization has always demonstrated the support of the international community for this just cause. A number of solutions have been proposed  and Security Council resolution 435 (1978) clearly defined the stages designed to lead Namibia to independence and sovereignty with territorial integrity. But since then South Africa has continued to defy the Organization. Worse still  Member States of the Organization which unconditionally voted for Security Council resolution 435 (1978) too often today show an accommodating attitude towards South Africa and its claim to link Namibian independence to the breaking of international agreements made by neighbouring sovereign States. Togo believes that Namibia's independence is a problem of decolonization  which falls within the framework and the objectives of the United Nations and that this problem must be separated from South Africa's interference in the internal affairs of Angola and the other front-line States.140.	Contempt for human rights and intolerance have been displayed during this year. The Government of Togo wishes to repeat its position on Chad. Togo deals with States  not with individuals. That is why Togo deals with Governments established by the peoples concerned. When it was the Tombalbaye Government  Togo dealt with that Government; when it was the Government of General Malloum  Togo dealt with that Government; when it was the Government of Goukouni Oueddei  Togo dealt with that Government. Today  since President Hissein Habre took power on 7 June 1982  Togo deals with Hissein Habre Tomorrow  if the people of Chad decides to acquire the leaders  Togo will deal with those leaders. Peoples acquire the leaders they want  and do so in different ways. It is not up to Togo  rather than the people concerned  to legitimize a Government.141.	Togo cherishes the firm hope that in the last analysis reason will triumph over contempt and time sooner or later dialogue will replace brutal arrogance.142.	As regards Western Sahara  Togo would like to recall that  faithful to its principles  since 15 March 1976 it has recognized the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic  in order to demonstrate its attachment to the principle of the self-determination of peoples. This is why we are all the more pleased that since the nineteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity  held in June  the hope has emerged of finally seeing implementation of the principle of the right to self-determination  which thus would allow the Saharan people to make its choice freely. We have stated that the events of the past year have been dominated by contempt for human rights and the rights of peoples. This is also true of the Middle East and other countries of Asia.143.	Regarding the situation in the Middle East and the Palestine problem  my country  Togo  is guided by the following principles. All peoples of the region must live in peace. Palestine has the right to an independent and sovereign State. We cannot refuse the Palestinians that which the international community granted the Israelis. The occupation of other peoples' territory by force must cease on the part of the State of Israel. All the parties involved  in a spirit of mutual respect for each other's rights  must understand that arms have never resolved problems and that only dialogue around the negotiating table can restore peace in this region that for more than 30 %rears has been a theatre of war. We should like to reiterate our position. Togo supports the just claim of the Palestinians to live in a sovereign and independent territory. This legitimate principle  from which the State of Israel has benefited  that State of Israel cannot refuse to others without evincing contempt for the fundamental rights of peoples and individuals.144.	Far from the troubled Middle East we find another hotbed of intolerance  Afghanistan. This problem emerged a few years ago following the invasion by foreign troops of that country  which wishes only to build its life in peace. When will there finally be respect for the right of the Afghan people to settle its own problems free from foreign interference.145.	In Democratic Kampuchea  strong backing has emerged around the tripartite coalition led by Prince Sihanouk  which serves as a lesson for the Vietnamese invader. Togo supports the efforts to achieve liberation of Democratic Kampuchea and cannot admit the accomplishment of occupation.146.	In Korea  the division of the country in two  were it to continue  would create a	situation of two fictitious Koreas  while the people aspire to unity. The proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and President Kim 11 Sung in our view are a basis for discussion  provided the foreign interference which hampers dialogue between the two parties is ended.147.	The contempt and arrogance of some are not revealed solely on the political level. Today the law of the strongest governs economic relations between nations.148.	Today it is a truism to state that the world economic crisis does not spare a single country. In the industrialized countries the slow-down in production has forced enterprises to cut jobs and the rate of unemployment has reached alarming proportions. The tidal wave of unemployment continues to grow  creating a category of marginal citizens from which bands of hooligans  bandits and members of gangs of all persuasions are recruited.149.	The developing countries  whose economies are from the outset dependent on the economies of the industrialized countries  painfully endure the consequences of economic stagnation spawned in the industrialized countries. As the weakest link in the world economic chain  the developing countries bear with difficulty a crisis which is not their fault. Forced to borrow on the international market to ensure their development  these countries are the first victims of increased interest rates. Loans which were made several years ago can now be doubled or tripled by the mere fact of the rise in the interest rate. This unprecedented debt is accompanied by the adverse effect of the rise in the dollar. Since foreign loans are pegged to the dollar a rise in that currency automatically entails a rise in the debt. A short time ago the rate of the dollar was still bearable  but today it has increased by more than 50 per cent.150.	Everybody seems completely indifferent to this tragedy. The development efforts undertaken by the poor countries have been wiped out at one stroke.151.	Instead of facing the crisis  some of the industrialized countries adopt a way out in which a new kind of protectionism replaces the old and smacks of abject xenophobia. Nearly everything is blamed on foreigners  although those same foreigners  now conveniently called ""expatriates""  for decades contributed to the development of the industrialized countries. Faced with this tragedy  what is the solution advocated by the great Powers? Nothing  or almost nothing. But perhaps that is not true. There are quite a lot of conferences  but they in no way propose real solutions. Are the great Powers at least inspired by the will to do something? We have our doubts. They seem to refuse to face reality. However  man's creative spirit is not totally lacking during this last part of the twentieth century  and as has been stated by the Founder-President of the Togo People's Party  the President of the Republic  General Gnassingbe Eyadema:""Today the development of science and technology has brought the people of our planet closer together and has endowed the developed nations with marvellous means of bringing about spectacular changes in the life of man.""But what would be the use of this progress  the fruit of the intelligence and work of the human community  if change did not include as a prerequisite for its objectives the world-wide improvement of the human condition?""152.	Indeed  what would be the use of discovering how to travel to the moon if nations refused to shoulder their responsibilities? Here the annual report of the Secretary- General speaks with the greatest force. We have the impression that nations taken individually tend to abdicate their historical responsibilities  and now there is a serious danger that nations collectively are not able to shoulder their international responsibilities. It is at this level that the role of the Security Council is crucial. The Secretary-General in his report makes the following highly significant statement:""All too often the members of the Security Council tend to be so divided on the matter at hand and so apprehensive of each other's reaction to it that agreement on how to proceed remains elusive. When we consider how to improve the performance of the United Nations we must give priority to the cohesion and co-operation of the membership in facing threats to international peace. We should recognize that such threats are of an importance which should override the differences of interest and ideology which separate the membership. The Council must be primarily used for the prevention of armed conflict and the search for solutions. Otherwise it will become peripheral to major issues  and in the end the world could pay  as it has before  a heavy price for not learning the lessons of history.""153.	What happened regarding the most recent events which the Council has had before it is proof of the situation of deadlock  since  faced with the threat to peace  faced with contempt for human rights and the rights of peoples  the Security Council has not been able to take a decision. It is to be hoped that the alarm sounded by the Secretary-General  who has expressed here the anguish of billions of human beings on Earth  will at last be heard. If the echo of this hope resounds from the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly  our meeting will not have been in vain. "
"131",6779,"THA",38,1983,"ï»¿64.	 Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of Thailand I am pleased to extend our warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The many pressing issues vitally affect the interests and well-being of peoples in many parts the world are reflected in the agenda of this session. These troubled times will doubtless require the application of those qualities of wisdom  dedication and prudence for which you have been duly recognized by the international community.65.	My delegation wishes also to express its sincere congratulations to the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly  who have been elected from the various regions of the world  as befits the universal character of the Organization.66.	The delegation of Thailand pledges its full cooperation to the President and all the Vice-Presidents who may be entrusted with the responsibility of guiding the Assembly's deliberations.67.	At the same time  I should like also to express my delegation's sincere appreciation to Mr. Imre Hollai for his distinguished leadership of the thirty-seventh session.68.	The delegation of Thailand is highly gratified by the accession of Saint Christopher and Nevis to independence and its admission to membership in the United Nations. I should like to take this opportunity to offer our sincere congratulations to the delegation of that new Member State  and we look forward to working closely with it in the promotion of closer international co-operation and understanding.69.	The year ahead does not promise to be any less dangerous or challenging than the one that has preceded it. New areas of conflict and tension in the heart of the African continent and in Central America place additional issues of concern on the long list of unresolved international crises. In southern Africa  the Middle East  Afghanistan and Kampuchea  we continue to witness the use of force by more powerful States against their neighbours and the denial to them of the fundamental right to self-determination. Numerous wars and conflicts continue to take their heavy toll of human lives  and new outbreaks of violence occur all too frequently. Al1 around the world helpless refugees huddle in makeshift encampments  victims of events beyond their control and for which they bear no responsibility. While little progress is being made towards a more just and equitable international economic order  the resources of nations are continually and increasingly strained by the arms race. The danger of nuclear confrontation is looming larger than ever  as new technology threatens to upset the balance of terror. The international peace and security which the Organization was founded to preserve are undermined by some of its own Members whose actions negate the very principles and purposes of its Charter  while its resolutions have had little effect in restraining the transgressors. Perhaps it reflects the desperation of our times that the Organization still holds out the hope and the challenge that mankind can ultimately rise above petty self-interests and vile ambitions. The present precarious state of the world does not diminish but rather underlines the value of the Organization and its Charter  which articulates the desired norms of international behaviour. It is therefore incumbent upon the Member States to help realize its noble aims and objectives and save mankind from self-destruction.70.	Last year the Secretary-General submitted a perceptive report on the work of the Organization in which he stressed that the central issue facing the United Nations was its capacity to keep peace and to serve as a forum for negotiations. The Secretary-General's report this year touches on similar themes. We wish also to commend highly his able stewardship of the Organization and the many initiatives he has taken on its behalf.71.	The Secretary-General recently undertook a mission to southern Africa in a renewed effort to bring independence to Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). From the outset  the United Nations has steadfastly advocated the inalienable right of the people of Namibia to self-determination and independence in a free and united Namibia. The Government of Thailand has consistently supported the unremitting efforts of the United Nations towards that end and will continue to do so. This worthy goal remains unaccomplished because of the intransigence of the Pretoria regime  which continues to act in defiance of the rest of humanity. Further delay in implementing resolution 435 (1978) can only aggravate the already tense situation and leave the South West Africa People's Organization  the representative of the Namibian people  with no alternative but to utilize all possible means to achieve freedom and national independence for Namibia. Meanwhile  any attempt by the occupying Power to impose any condition or unilateral settlement in Namibia in contravention of the relevant United Nations resolutions must be considered null and void. My delegation urges the contact group to exert all possible effort  constant with the Charter of the United Nations and in conjunction with the efforts of the Secretary- General  to hasten Namibia's independence at the earliest possible date through the free exercise by all its people of their right to self-determination.72.	Over a span of four decades the issues of the Middle East have dominated the Assembly's agenda. The situation in the Middle East as a whole continues to be volatile and potentially dangerous for international peace and security. My Government reaffirms its basic position regarding the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and thus calls on Israel to withdraw from the Arab territories which it has occupied since 1967 and to refrain from all measures designed to perpetuate its presence in those territories. My delegation's position on the question of Palestine is to support the attainment by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights  particularly the right to self-determination  free from outside interference or coercion  including the right to national independence and sovereignty and the right to return to their homes and properties.73.	My delegation believes that the plight of the Palestinians remains central to the Middle East problem and that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East must be based on application of the two agreed elements incorporated in Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  namely  the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied Arab territories and recognition of the legitimate right of every State in the area  including Israel  to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. The Thai delegation strongly urges all parties to exert every effort to revitalize the peace process in the region so as to bring about a settlement which would meet justly the legitimate interests and aspirations of all concerned.74.	The invasion of Lebanon in June last year by Israeli forces was condemned by the international community. The Government of Thailand has joined other countries in calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon  in accordance with the wish of the Government and people of Lebanon as well as the relevant United Nations resolutions. My delegation welcomes the news of a cease-fire agreement  which indicates the willingness of all the parties concerned to resort to negotiations rather than the use of force in order to resolve their differences. This new development leads us to hope that the withdrawal of all foreign forces will be expeditiously undertaken so that full sovereignty over all its territory may be restored to the Government of Lebanon and its people.75.	The continuing foreign occupation of Afghanistan has exacted a heavy toll of Afghan patriots and threatened the security of neighbouring States. The delegation of Thailand reaffirms its full support for the calls by the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the General Assembly for the immediate and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan so that the Afghan people may be able to choose its form of government free from outside intervention  subversion  coercion or constraint of any kind. United Nations agencies continue their vital role in providing humanitarian assistance to the growing number of Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries  particularly Pakistan  which has had to bear an enormous burden. It is imperative that the humanitarian assistance for Afghan refugees who have been forced to flee their homeland be given full international support. My delegation calls on all the parties concerned to proceed in good faith with the negotiations being conducted under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his special representative so that meaningful agreements can be reached on the four essential elements of withdrawal of foreign troops  non-interference by outside Powers in the internal affairs of Afghanistan  international guarantees of non-intervention  and the safe and voluntary return of Afghan refugees to their homeland.76.	In South-East Asia the continuing tragedy of Kampuchea poses similarly grave security and humanitarian concern for the international community. For the fifth successive year the Kampuchean people find themselves under the yoke of alien domination and foreign occupation and are being denied their right to self-determination. The Kampuchean people have been uprooted from their homes and large numbers have been forced to seek food  shelter and safety in neighbouring Thailand and along the Thai-Kampuchean border. Approximately 60 000 Kampuchean displaced persons are in camps supervised by the UNHCR in Thailand  waiting for resettlement opportunities in third countries or a chance to return safely to their homes  and over 200 000 more are encamped along the border  where they are totally dependent on humanitarian assistance co-ordinated by the United Nations border relief operation. The massive influx of Kampuchean refugees and displaced persons to Thailand has in turn displaced over 100 000 Thai villagers in the border areas. The Kampuchean refugee encampments  as well as the local population in the border areas  are under constant threat of  med attack  shelling and bombardment by Vietnamese occupation forces in Kampuchea. Systematic attacks were conducted by those forces against Kampuchean civilian refugee camps between January and April of this year in violation of humanitarian principles  resulting in numerous casualties. The attacking forces also razed to the Red Cross hospital  schools  and lowly shelters winch have housed tens of thousands of refugees. Bombardment of those camps by Vietnamese guns has continued sporadically since June of this year  hampering international operations and exacerbating the already tense situation along the border.77.	The plight of the Kampuchean refugees and displaced persons  as well as that of the affected Thai villagers in the border areas  rightly continues to be a matter of serious concern to the international community. It may be recalled in particular that the General Assembly  in resolution 35/6  cat d for stationing a United Nations observer team on the Thai side of the border  in conjunction with the establishment of safe areas under United Nations supervision in western Kampuchea for the displaced Kampuchean civilians who wished to return to their homeland. Once again the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council expressed grave concern over the activities of the foreign forces in Kampuchea  in particular their military attacks on refugees along the Thai-Kampuchean border. My delegation therefore believes that appropriate measures such as establishing safe areas for Kampuchean civilians and stationing United Nations observers should again be considered in order to help deter future Vietnamese actions and thus save innocent lives.78.	The Government of Thailand reaffirms its continued commitment to humanitarian principles in doing whatever it can to alleviate the sufferings of the Kampuchean refugees and displaced persons  but our efforts require a reciprocal commitment on the part of the international community. As we are a developing country  our resources are limited  and the accompanying political  social and security considerations related to the refugee problem impose an additional strain on Thai society. We shall continue to do our fair share  but we cannot be expected to shoulder the burden alone. The United Nations has been in the forefront of the international effort to assist Kampuchean civilians affected by the ongoing conflict in Kampuchea. This undertaking is in line with the Organization's highest purposes and principles; The continuing humanitarian needs along the Thai-Kampuchean border are both real and manifest. It is an international problem that calls for international action. It is the proper function of the United Nations to respond to these pressing humanitarian needs. The Government of Thailand therefore urges the United Nations and the Secretary-General to continue to provide the framework and leadership for the humanitarian relief and assistance programme along the Thai-Kampuchean border.79.	In this regard my delegation would like to express its profound appreciation to the donor countries as well as to the Secretary-General  the United Nations agencies  the International Committee of the Red Cross and the many international voluntary agencies which have helped to avert a major tragedy by coming to the relief and assistance of Kampuchean refugees and displaced persons. We urge donor countries to continue to give their full support to the humanitarian relief operation of the United Nations and also to consider sympathetically the urgent need for increased resettlement of Kampuchean as well as other Indo-Chinese refugees. At the same time  the inalienable right of Kampuchean refugees and other displaced Indo-Chinese people to return safely to their homes must be reaffirmed. Voluntary repatriation continues to be the most natural solution to the refugee problem in South-East Asia. However  it is apparent that the humanitarian situation in South-East Asia can be permanently resolved only through a comprehensive settlement on the underlying political problems. As the Secretary-General states in his annual report ""The problem of refugees can be resolved only with a settlement of the root political causes"".80.	There are disturbing reports of demographic changes being imposed by the occupying Power in several provinces of Kampuchea through the settlement of Vietnamese nationals and the further displacement of the Kampuchean population. Such action is in contravention of international law and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12 August 1949  and should be strongly condemned by the world community.81.	Viet Nam's present intransigence and intentions constitute destabilizing factors in South-East Asia and continue to hinder constructive dialogue and co-operation among the countries of the region. The situation in Kampuchea continues to be a direct threat to the peace and stability of the region as well as to international peace and security.82.	In recognition of this fact  the General Assembly at the past four successive sessions adopted  by overwhelming and increasing majorities  resolutions calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea and the free exercise of self-determination by the Kampuchean people.83.	The Assembly and the International Conference on Kampuchea held under United Nations auspices in 1981 have outlined a reasonable and practical framework for peaceful settlement of the conflict which takes into account the legitimate interests of all concerned. My delegation earnestly calls upon Viet Nam as a Member of the Organization to forgo the recourse to arms and to begin the process of negotiations that will lead to a peaceful and comprehensive political settlement of the Kampuchean problem in the interests of regional as well as international peace and security.84.	In an effort to create the necessary atmosphere for negotiations  I proposed in April of this year that Viet Nam withdraw its forces 30 kilometres from the Thai- Kampuchean border. That proposal was endorsed by the other foreign ministers of the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations as a necessary confidence-building measure. It was also intended as a measure to relieve tension and  in particular  the danger to Kampuchean civilian refugees along the border. Regrettably  the Vietnamese response has been negative and renewed bombardment of refugee encampments along the border has since occurred.85.	Since Viet Nam has announced partial withdrawals of its troops  it should agree to withdraw those troops from the Thai border  an action that would be more verifiable as it will take place in a clearly defined geographical area. It is further proposed that a cease-fire be observed in the areas where withdrawals have taken place  which should then be constituted as safe areas for uprooted Kampuchean civilians under the auspices of UNHCR. In addition  a United Nations peace-keeping force or observer group could be introduced to supervise the withdrawals and to keep the peace along the border. International economic assistance would then be envisaged as a means to help rebuild the livelihood of the uprooted Kampucheans in those areas. 86.	The people of Kampuchea have suffered inexorably from the ravages of war and the military occupation of their country. The ASEAN foreign ministers have therefore envisaged the eventual convening of an international conference for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Kampuchea after the withdrawal of all foreign forces  as part of a comprehensive settlement of the Kampuchean problem.87.	Despite a five-year campaign of suppression and intimidation  the Kampuchean nationalist resistance against the Vietnamese occupation forces is growing in strength. The coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  under the presidency of Prince Norodom Sihanouk  has rallied the Kampuchean people to the struggle for national liberation and independence and has gained wide international support and recognition. The broad- based Coalition Government under Prince Sihanouk is a positive step towards a comprehensive political settlement and national reconciliation in Kampuchea. My delegation would like to express its deep appreciation to the Chairman of the Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea  Mr. Massamba Sarre of Senegal  as well as to the other members of the Hoc Committee  for their continuing efforts to find a just and durable solution to the Kampuchean problem  in accordance with the mandate entrusted to them by the International Conference on Kampuchea. At the same time  my delegation expresses its sincere appreciation for the continued efforts of Mr. Willibald Pahr of Austria  the President of the International Conference on Kampuchea.88.	My delegation would also like to express its deep appreciation for the ongoing efforts of the Secretary- General and his special representatives and staff which have been undertaken on the Assembly's behalf and in the interest of international peace and security. My delegation urges the United Nations to continue its legitimate role in order to foster a peaceful process  within the framework of the Charter  for the resolution of this pressing international issue.89.	My delegation is deeply concerned at the prolonged and serious crisis afflicting the global economy. We believe that  while the underlying problems are structural in nature and can be alleviated by certain domestic adjustments  determined international efforts to revitalize the development process  and in particular to accelerate economic growth in the developing countries  are necessary for a sustained global recovery. Given the reality of economic interdependence  we believe that such recovery must go hand in hand with development; the two are inseparable.90.	For this reason  my delegation is disappointed that the recent sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  at Belgrade  failed to adopt the type of resolutions which would have addressed themselves to the urgent imperatives of our time. In particular  they failed to respond to the immediate need for concerted international action to assist the developing countries  many of which are experiencing serious balance- of-payments deficits  shrinkage of resource flows and access to markets  increasing import costs and hence declining capacity to import capital goods needed for economic development.91.	As a developing country heavily dependent for the financing of its development programmes on export earnings from food products  agricultural produce and industrial raw materials  Thailand is particularly concerned that commodity prices in the past few years have plunged to their lowest level in over 30 years. Increasing resort by the industrialized countries to protectionist measures  including export subsidies  quantitative restrictions and a host of other non-tariff barriers  continues to accentuate the economic crisis of the developing countries  including Thailand  as well as to hamper trade growth and global economic recovery. My delegation therefore believes that commitments to maintain an open trading system  such as were agreed to at the ministerial meeting of the Contracting Parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in November 1982  must be backed promptly by specific actions to reduce barriers to trade. Thus  while my Government welcomes the commitments to halt protectionism made in May 1983 at the Williamsburg Summit of Industrialized Nations  we are disheartened to learn that the dismantling of the debilitating trade barriers is made conditional upon progress in the recovery of the developed economies.92.	My delegation endorses the urgent need for sustained mobilization of international financial resources to assist the national efforts of the developing countries to harness domestic energy sources. We renew our call for an early establishment of the proposed energy affiliate of the World Bank and urge efficient implementation of the Nairobi Programme of Action for the Development and Utilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy* as expeditiously as possible.93.	My delegation attaches high priority to the goals of collective self-reliance and greater economic and technical co-operation among the developing countries  not only within the ASEAN sub region  but also at the global level within the framework of the Caracas Programme of Action Thailand played host to a meeting in implementation of that Programme and took an active part in the recent meeting at Tunis of the Intergovernmental Follow-up and Co-ordination Committee set up by the Caracas Programme of Action. We shall continue these efforts in the belief that their success will enhance the prospect of achieving a restructured and equitable world economic order.94.	Furthermore  since South-South co-operation has become increasingly important and relevant to future development strategies  and even though the primary responsibility for such co-operation lies with the developing countries themselves  we believe that the continued support of the United Nations system is indispensable.95.	While we are striving to establish a more equitable international economic order  the world's resources are being disproportionately spent on armaments both nuclear and conventional. Furthermore  the arms race is moving into the deep sea and outer space. Efforts both within and outside the framework of the United Nations to halt and reverse the arms race have had limited success in the face of technological advances which win soon make earlier achievements in strategic arms control less meaningful. Concurrently  the deterioration in the international situation  marked by hotbeds of tension  has heightened the sense of insecurity among nations and provided an added impetus to the momentum of the arms race  thereby bringing the world nearer to self-annihilation.96.	Although the predominant goal of nuclear disarmament remains undisputed  the danger that conventional armaments have posed to peace  security and mankind must not be ignored. Measures to arrest this alarming trend are therefore urgently needed. As a further step to advance the cause of disarmament  an initiative such as the establishment of zones of peace in various regions of the world should be further promoted. Such zones of peace will help to create conditions which are conducive to regional peace and stability  thereby strengthening the security of States and contributing to the goal of disarmament.97.	In the light of this fact  Thailand and other ASEAN nations have since 1971 called for the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia. This would also serve as a basis for co-operation and good will among all the countries of the region. Today Thailand and the other ASEAN countries are still actively pursuing this goal and remain committed to the early realization of the concept. Similarly  the establishment of a zone of peace in South Asia could enhance the prospects of peace  stability and security in that important region of the world. My delegation supports all constructive and meaningful efforts to bring about the early realization of the proposal. We regret that the Committee on the Indian Ocean has thus far failed to reach a consensus on the date for the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean  at Colombo. My delegation hopes that the divergence of views in the Hoc Committee can be narrowed so that the Conference may be duly convened.98.	While according priority to nuclear and conventional disarmament  the urgent need to curb other types of armaments cannot be overlooked. The Thai delegation remains concerned at reports on the alleged uses of chemical and biological weapons in certain areas of the world  including South-West and South-East Asia. In view of their inhumane and indiscriminate effects  my delegation is firmly opposed to the development  manufacture  stockpiling and use of these weapons. In 1981 and 1982 my Government provided every assistance and co-operation to the United Nations groups of experts which were sent to Thailand to collect evidence on the use of those weapons in accordance with General Assembly resolution 35/144. Unfortunately  the United Nations experts were not permitted to enter the affected areas in the neighbouring countries to conduct on-site investigations. We hope that co-operation will be forthcoming from the countries concerned and that doubts with regard to the scope of application of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and the 1972 Convention? will soon be resolved and a procedure acceptable to all sides will be established for verification of compliance.99.	While the arms race proceeds at an uncontrolled pace it is not surprising that over-reliance on weapons at times leads to tragic results. The circumstances surrounding the shooting down of the Korean Air Lines passenger aircraft have cast a long dark shadow over international affairs. The Government and people of Thailand were deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic event and the loss of 269 innocent lives  including those of eight Thai nationals. We participated in the Security Council debate and deeply deplored the Soviet action  to no avail. The Thai Government demands that the resolution recently adopted by the extraordinary session of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization be fully implemented so that the provisions relating to safety of international civil aviation can be strengthened. All parties concerned should give their full cooperation to the ICAO investigation  so as to prevent the recurrence of such a tragic event. We once again urge the Soviet Government to assume responsibility for its actions and duly compensate the families of those who lost their lives. An appropriate humanitarian response by the Soviet Government could help to restore confidence in the safety of international civil aviation as well as in the viability of civilized norms of conduct between States.100.	It is therefore pertinent to remind the Assembly that the situation in the region of Asia where the tragic event occurred remains unsettled and could pose a threat to international peace and security. Territorial disputes dating from the conclusion of the Second World War remain outstanding and are a source of tension. On the Korean peninsula there is an understandable aspiration towards peaceful reunification of the Korean nation. My delegation believes that reunification should be decided upon by the Korean people themselves without external interference  in accordance with the principle of self- determination. My delegation therefore urges that a dialogue be initially agreed upon between the North and South of Korea to resolve the Korean question by peaceful means.101.	The intractability of the many issues and problems in international affairs which have been laid at the doorstep of the United Nations has diminished confidence in the Organization's capacity to maintain and manage a peaceful world order. This may be said to reflect the diversity and complexity of a world of nation-States and the reality that there is little that can be done if the strong and powerful choose to ignore or circumvent the Organization. And yet the United Nations stands as a symbol of hope for the major part of humanity. The overwhelming majority of States  many of which have been assisted by the Organization in the attainment of their independence  adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Their faith in the Organization can be a force for stability in world affairs. Witness  for example  the role of many less-powerful nations in peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. Moreover  the United Nations is involved in vital developmental  social and technical assistance for peoples in all parts of the world. The Organization is engaged in attempts to ameliorate conflict situations or to prevent their escalation in many critical areas  including southern Africa  the Middle East  Afghanistan and Kampuchea. Thus the efforts of the Secretary-General and the various organs of the United Nations deserve the full support of all Member States  for much more needs to be done before we can hope to bequeath to succeeding generations a peaceful  secure and prosperous world. We must not fail to leave this legacy. If we did  there would not be many generations to succeed ours. "
"132",6895,"TTO",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	 On behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago I congratulate Mr. Jorge Illueca on his election to the office of President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that his vast experience and skill  particularly in the United Nations system  will contribute tremendously to the fruitful outcome of our work at this session. His election to the presidency is recognition of the high esteem in which his country and he himself are held by the international community.2.	My delegation pays tribute also to the outgoing President  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  who so successfully presided over the work of the thirty-seventh session.3.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago wishes to express its warmest congratulations to Saint Christopher and Nevis  a sister Caribbean State  upon its achievement of independence  on 19 September 1983  and its admission as the 158th Member of the United Nations. It says much for the continuing relevance and influence of the United Nations and its pivotal role in the maintenance of international peace and security that while newly independent States face the challenges posed by such factors as small size  economic and infrastructure underdevelopment and limited natural and manpower resources  their Governments attach high priority to membership in this Organization.4.	We  the countries of the Caribbean Community and Common Market  have achieved our independence peacefully  but not without the dedication  hard work and sacrifice of several generations. We have thus sought to create societies founded on the values and aspirations of our peoples  enriched by the diversity of their racial  ethnic and cultural heritage. My delegation is confident that this respect for the human experience and the ability to forge a cohesive society will enable Saint Christopher and Nevis  like the rest of our Caribbean societies  to contribute invaluably to the future work of the United Nations.5.	The current crisis in the world economy continues. Recent hopes of a slackening in the recession appear to have been premature. The projected upturns in the economic activity of the developed market economies have not materialized. Indeed  there are disturbing signs that these economies may decline this winter. World trade over the last two years has been stagnant for the first time in the post-war period. Inevitably the situation has had particularly severe repercussions for the developing countries  which  while being on the periphery of global economic decision-making  are the first to feel its negative effects. The consequences for their development and for the social and economic well-being of their peoples have been disastrous.6.	Domestic policies being adopted by several countries to deal with the crisis continue to exacerbate it. High- interest-rate policies impact directly on the crushing debt burden of developing countries. High interest rates are the single most destructive element frustrating the efforts of developing countries to improve their economies. With these interest rates at 18 per cent  and with the need to renegotiate and extend repayment schedules  original debt doubles in less than four years  even without any new borrowing. The severe debt burden and debt servicing problems confronting most developing countries have worsened in 1983. Their debt burden is approximately $540 billion and requires over $100 billion annually in servicing. This has made it necessary for many developing countries to seek to defer repayment or to reschedule their loans  sometimes through further borrowing  simply for the payment of capital and interest due and not for new investment or additions to infrastructure. It is not surprising that under these circumstances there is widespread concern that the collapse of the economies of certain States could have disastrous consequences for the global monetary and financial structures.7.	In conjunction with high interest rates  there has been an unprecedented depression of the world commodity markets. In nearly all developing countries  including the net oil producers  export earnings experienced a catastrophic decline. This decline has been due to the state of the global economy and partly to the imposition of protectionist trade barriers by some developed countries. This myopic panacea  adopted by several important trading nations  restricts the volume of world trade and intensifies the world economic crisis. Developing countries thus find themselves with insufficient foreign exchange earnings to meet their current requirements for imported goods and services and no foreign exchange reserves with which to meet their debt obligations.8.	The energy-exporting countries  for a while ""growth poles"" within the developing world  have not escaped the ravages of the crisis  and some of these countries are now faced with massive external debts from both official and commercial sources. At this time there is also a substantial decline in concessional loans for development  increasing obstacles to access to international capital markets and in fact a general lack of concern for the poor  be they individuals or nations. Even though certain economic and social forces combine to create and maintain poverty and dependence  it is convenient to think and say that destitution among certain nations of the world is a result of improvidence. And so  the remedies prescribed involve drastic devaluation  internal financial stringency  massive unemployment and import restraint  even on essentials.9.	Not too long ago  it was being said that the main cause of economic difficulties for developing as well as for developed countries was the high price of oil. It has now become clear  however  beyond any shadow of doubt  that the malaise and crisis within the international economic system has its genesis in other problems that are deep-set and of a structural nature.10.	A telling defect of the present international system is its inability to proffer guidance and attainable solutions  both political and economic  to ensure that the interests of the world community as a whole are adequately addressed.11.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has been insistent that only through global perspectives and the adoption of a holistic approach to the present situation will the problems of the world economy and its future growth be satisfactorily resolved. The occasional small financial grants made to developing countries  further high-interest loans  selective and limited commercial concessions will not provide the answer. Such measures will merely contribute to continued economic and social privation  political disaffection  social upheaval and even revolution.12.	The resources of developing countries must be fully optimized for the benefit of their own people  and any economic co-operation between developed and developing countries must be predicated upon mutual respect and absence of inhibiting conditions.13.	The fabric of the international economic system is now so closely interwoven that it is extremely difficult  if not impossible  to separate issues whether or not they relate to trade  aid  commodities or monetary and financial development. The Bretton Woods institutions  which are now nearly 40 years old  are not equipped to deal with a world that has changed dramatically since the Second World War and in which economic power centres are more diverse and greater in number. Trinidad and Tobago firmly believes that the international community should give immediate consideration to recommendations for the reform of the international monetary system adopted by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi in March this year.14.	At Buenos Aires the developing countries extended a hand of meaningful co-operation to the developed countries. That gesture was rejected at the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  at Belgrade. The developed countries failed to adopt any of the prescriptions offered by developing countries for collective solutions to the problems of the international economic system.15.	The failure of that session is not to be attributed to the institution but to its members. The international community must accept the responsibility for the progressive deterioration of the machinery it has established for international economic co-operation.16.	In this respect  we fully endorse the decision of the countries of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to have a fresh political impetus to global negotiations and support the proposal to hold at the United Nations in 1984 a conference to deal with the subject. Trinidad and Tobago recognizes this initiative as an attempt to strengthen international co-operation and to revive the North-South dialogue.17.	Trinidad and Tobago regrets that  after six years and the two-part four-week special session at United Nations Headquarters in New York this year  the Commission on Transnational Corporations was still unable to complete its work on the elaboration of a code of conduct for transnational corporations.18.	Trinidad and Tobago shares the disappointment expressed by the Group of 77 that the flexibility and accommodation shown by the Group has not been reciprocated and calls upon those States concerned to display a more serious attitude and spirit of compromise in their approach to this exercise.19.	Trinidad and Tobago is pleased that  after long and difficult consultations and negotiations  most of the obstacles in the path of the establishment of a viable long- term financing system for science and technology for development have been removed and that the system can now become operational.20.	My country  like many other developing countries  is aware of the importance of the financing system in strengthening the scientific and technological capacities of developing countries  thereby accelerating their development. We therefore urge all potential donor countries to participate actively in the system in order to mobilize the identified core and non-core resources for the initial period 1983-1985.21.	Trinidad and Tobago commends the efforts of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 to intensify economic co-operation among developing countries. We do not envisage these relations as a substitute for North- South dialogue and international co-operation but as a complementary attempt to maximize and promote the rational and efficient use of human  material  financial and technological resources available in the developing countries.22.	In the present crisis of international co-operation  the need to accelerate economic co-operation among developing countries becomes more crucial. Over the last five years the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has demonstrated its commitment to integration and economic co-operation among developing countries by making available more than half a billion dollars to the members of the Caribbean Community. This assistance  to which we remain committed  has been channelled through the Caribbean Development Bank and other existing sub regional institutions  as well as through our own programmes for technical assistance and cooperation. Trinidad and Tobago will continue  within the limits of its resources and in spite of the hardships imposed by the present international economic crisis  to assist its partners in the sub region and would encourage other hemispheric actors to translate their words into actions that would assist positively in the development of the sub region. 23.	UNDP  the largest dispenser of technical assistance and co-operation within the United Nations system  has in the last few years experienced a serious shortfall in contributions to the extent that contributions in the third cycle  1982-1986  could fall below the level of the first cycle in real terms.24.	In addition  there appear to be attempts to alter the structure of UNDP  which could result in recipient countries having less jurisdiction in determining priority areas for their countries' programmes. Trinidad and Tobago will support any effort to improve the governance of UNDP and to optimize the use of available resources in so far as these measures do not alter its unique characteristics. It is our view that this is the time not for reducing but for at least maintaining financial inputs to UNDP so that its invaluable contributions to developing countries can be enhanced.25.	Earlier this year the seventh session of the Caribbean Development and Co-operation Committee was held at Port of Spain. On that occasion  in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee  I stated that the high vision embodied in the creation of the Committee eight years ago had not been reflected in the experience of its members and in the functioning of that body. The Committee has met with many impediments to its full effectiveness both at the level of its secretariat in the Port of Spain office and in ECLA in terms of resources  staffing and procedure.26.	On behalf of the members of the Committee  who are committed to playing their part to improve its functioning and effectiveness  let me express the hope that the United Nations system will do all in its power to complement our efforts in providing a truly efficient and effective operational programme for development in the Caribbean region.27.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago considers that development can best be pursued in a climate of peace and security. History has shown that arms races inevitably culminate in war. The arms race continues unabated  with little sign of any substantial change of attitude on the part of the major Powers. Some estimates give the amount spent on armaments over the past year as $650 billionâresources that are sorely needed for social and economic development. Apart from the actual expenditure on armaments  there are also the resources  human and financial  which are channelled into the disarmament effort and are thus deflected from constructive developmental activities.28.	There continues to be much talk  even by the military Powers themselves  about disarmament. In recent times this has tended to focus on the prevention of a nuclear war and the prevention of an arms race in outer space. But  while there is talk of peace  there continues to be a massive build-up of the store of arms at a rate that can be described only as preparations for war  preparations for war that are tempered only by discussions on the non-first-use of nuclear weapons.29.	Trinidad and Tobago is concerned not solely with the prevention of a nuclear war  vital though that is  but also with the growth and spread of conventional weapons  which are a major factor contributing to present international tension and instability. We further deplore the development and use of chemical and bacteriological weapons.30.	The recent upsurge of popular peace movements throughout the world indicates that  even if policy-makers have not recognized the grave danger of extinction facing us  public opinion has. Trinidad and Tobago's wish is for the world to be free of the persistent danger of total self-destruction which man continues to impose upon himself  and we are sure that we share the ultimate goal of all  or most  States: that of general and complete disarmament.31.	But it is not only the East-West confrontation that poses major dangers. In every corner of the globe the names of war are being fanned; sometimes in the name of peace  at other times in the name of religion; sometimes in the name of political ideology or territorial sovereignty  at other times in the name of economic independence. Each instance of war  large or small  declared or undeclared  will contribute to the ever-escalating threat to international peace and security.32.	Trinidad and Tobago views with great concern- indeed  alarmâthe grave situation in Central America  a situation which almost daily assumes new and more dangerous proportions. The problems of the region originate in social and economic ills  ills which are exploited by others who are ever eager to promote strife and disharmony in pursuit of their own ambitions.33.	The worthy efforts of the Contadora Group are to be welcomed and highly commended. We implore those States actively involved in the conflicts to continue to co-operate fully in the Contadora initiative. We further appeal to all States to desist from seeking to impose any settlement in the region by the use or threat of use of force  to exercise due respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all individual States  and to use their influence to promote economic and social justice in Central America. In this context  I recall that at the last session I urged the great Powers not to import their rivalries  conflicts and tensions into the Caribbean. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago reiterates that appeal and insists that the Caribbean area be a zone of peace in which peaceful and amicable solutions are found to the problems of the area.34.	In July the world celebrated the bicentenary of the birth of Simon Bolivar  the Liberator  and paid a tribute to his great deeds in the interests of a new and better way of life for mankind. The freedoms which he won and inspired must not be lost or subjugated to the interests of bloc politics. Our freedom  our independence  our sovereignty  must be preserved  and our disputes must be settled in a just and peaceful manner.35.	Trinidad and Tobago is pleased to have played a role in the evolution of a peaceful settlement of the Guyana-Venezuela controversy. We therefore welcome the fact that the two countries have now referred the choice of a means of settlement to the Secretary-General in accordance with the provisions of article IV  paragraph 2  of the Geneva Agreement.' Trinidad mid Tobago hopes that this controversy will be quickly and peacefully resolved  thus restoring international confidence in the process of the peaceful settlement of disputes.36.	Trinidad and Tobago reiterates the sentiments of the heads of Government conference of the Caribbean Community and Common Market  held in July 1983 at Port of Spain  in respect of the position maintained by the Government of Guatemala on the status of Belizeâ a full Member of the United Nations family and an independent State. Trinidad and Tobago endorses the principle of territorial integrity and fully supports the position of the Government of Belize that this matter should be settled by peaceful means  without prejudice to its sovereignty and territorial integrity.37.	The Middle East continues to engage the attention of the international community  as tension  confrontation and armed conflicts spread. As in the past  the central issue and the key to a just and lasting peace in the region remains the question of Palestine. Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its support for the full sovereign rights of the Palestinian people to a permanent homeland and to self- determination in their own State.38.	Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the peace initiatives that have been proposed and is of the firm conviction that success will hinge on the participation of all parties and interests concerned  including the Palestinian people through their legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO].39.	Palestine was only last month the subject of an international conference held at Geneva. That conference adopted a programme of action  containing many positive elements which  if adhered to  could contribute towards a peaceful  just and lasting solution of the problems of the area. The delegation of Trinidad and Tobago notes with particular interest the proposal that an international peace conference on the Middle East should be held.40.	Turning to the question of Lebanon  Trinidad and Tobago implores all States to respect General Assembly resolution 37/123 E  which calls for ""strict respect of the territorial integrity  sovereignty  unity and political independence of Lebanon"".41.	We look forward to the early cessation of conflict and welcome therefore the present cease-fire which we hope will be a first step on the road to reconciliation and normalcy for that beleaguered country.42.	Peace initiatives motivated by or directed towards selfish national interests breed conflict rather than peace. We States Members of the United Nations family must all rededicate ourselves to the fundamental principles that sustain this body.43.	One of these is enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter: ""To maintain international peace and security  andto that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace  . . . and to bring about by peaceful means  and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law  adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace"".44.	This implies the existence of a political will  a spirit of co-operation and mutual respect and trust among Member States of the Organization  qualities which find expression in adherence to the principles of the United Nations and respect for the implementation of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. Those principles also demand an equal obligation to ensure that the resolutions introduced into the deliberations of the General Assembly and Security Council are based on veracity  respect for Charter principles and the search for peace. Otherwise  Member States  especially those glorying in their real or apparent military might and in their sense of national importance  may be tempted to ignore or veto them.45.	My delegation thanks the Secretary-General for his thought-provoking report on the work of the Organization. We concur in his view that 1983 has  so far  been a frustrating year for the search for peace  stability and justice and for those who believe that the United Nations is the best available international mechanism to achieve these ends.46.	The Secretary-General further emphasized that the time has come to move from words to action. My delegation wishes to commend this sentiment to all Members of the Organization and hopes that our common sense of purpose and direction will help us achieve the vital objective of the preservation of peace.47.	One aspect of this common sense of purpose and direction can be manifested by the universal acceptance of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This Convention is still to be ratified by certain States which participated actively in the long years of work which went into formulating this historic agreement. It will be of immense importance and a major contribution to the functioning of the International Sea-Bed Authority if this can be a truly universal body in which all members will co-operate in utilizing and preserving the resources of the sea-bed and its environs for the welfare and betterment of all mankind.48.	I now turn to the question of human rights. Trinidad and Tobago is alarmed at the unabated incidence of human rights violations throughout the world. We abhor any acts or measures designed to deprive an individual of his basic fundamental rights and freedoms. We urge Member States to comply fully with the relevant United Nations conventions  and we express our support for the efforts made by United Nations bodies to monitor and report on human rights violations.49.	In this context  I call attention once more to southern Africa  a region in which human rights  fundamental freedoms and the dignity of man are held in total contempt. The International Conference in Support of the Struggle of the Namibian People for Independence  which was held in Paris in April 1983  and the Security Council  which met from 23 May to 1 June 1983 to consider the question of Namibia  have both recognized that the preliminaries necessary for the implementation of Namibian independence  in accordance with the plan contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  have been in the main completed. The linkage theory that makes Namibia's proceeding to independence conditional on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angolaâ espoused by certain members of the Western contact groupâhas rightly been rejected outright by an overwhelming majority of the international community. It is inconceivable that any of us  States Members of the United Nations  long advocates of the principles of democracy  human rights and self-determination  should insist on such a linkage. Namibia's independence cannot be an issue for barter.50.	South Africa's appointment of a State Council for Namibia to draw up a constitution for that country is yet another indication of its inability to act in good faith on this question. Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its conviction that unless and until the international community unites in clear determination to deal with the independence of the Pretoria regime  as demonstrated by its policies on Namibia and its repressive and abhorrent internal policy of apartheid by imposing full mandatory sanctions against it in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  no change will come about in that troubled part of the world.51.	The past year has seen an escalation of tension in the southern African region as the apartheid regime continues its flagrant attacks on neighbouring sovereign States. It is an undeniable fact that that regime poses an extremely grave threat to the stability and peace not only of the region but of the continent of Africa and  indeed  of the international community of nations.52.	Trinidad and Tobago and other countries of the West Indian cricket community have recently been targeted by that regime  which  in its attempt to obfuscate international public opinion and break out of its isolation  has lured sporting personalities to its shores by offers of vast sums of money. Trinidad and Tobago clearly recognizes this ploy as another attempt by the regime in Pretoria to disguise its racist policies. We hasten to point out that the resources they offer are ill-gotten and derived from collaboration with those States which defy the will of the majority of the international community by offering support and succour to that regime.53.	The vast sums of money being offered to our sports personalities must derive from South Africa's commercial sector  stimulated by its external trade with its partners  and we therefore appeal to all Member States  all United Nations and anti-apartheid organizations  to exercise greater vigilance with respect to economic sanctions against South Africa  since that country's economic base is the foundation on which its abhorrent system continues to thrive. The position of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago against sportingâand  indeed  all otherâ links with South Africa is already a matter of record in the Assembly.54.	We believe that every encouragement must be given to our sportsmen and sportswomen to enhance both their earning capacity and their international reputations. The Assembly may wish to give serious consideration to the provision of the machinery and funds to stimulate further the development of programmes  particularly in developing countries  to help sportsmen  sportswomen and artistes achieve their goals and ensure that they are no longer vulnerable to the blandishments of the apartheid regime.55.	In the meantime Trinidad and Tobago looks forward to the early completion of the drafting of an international convention against	in sports.56.	In closing may I once again quote from the report of the Secretary-General. He states:""We are at present in a period when the value of multilateral diplomacy is being questioned and international institutions are not functioning as they were intended to function. The machinery is running and the wheels are turning  but it is not moving forward as it should. ... We must find means to push the machinery into forward motion again.""57.	The danger of our times lies in our institutions' divorcing themselves from the international public interest. It is therefore necessary to rededicate ourselves to Charter principles in order to restore confidence in the Organization and to ensure implementation of its resolutions. Should we fail to do so  our efforts to find peaceful solutions and promote significant development will be met with frustration. "
"133",6941,"TUN",38,1983,"ï»¿195.	Tunisia is particularly happy to see such an eminent statesman as Mr. Illueca presiding over the work of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. He represents Panama  a friendly country and a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries which has distinguished itself by its active support for just causes throughout the world. In conveying to him the warm congratulations of the Tunisian delegation  which in the past has had occasion to appreciate his distinguished personal qualities  we find it a pleasure to be working under him again. We assure him of our wholehearted support and co-operation.196.	His predecessor as President  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  discharged his important functions with an acute sense of responsibility and objectivity  allied with great competence and unfailing courtesy. We were very appreciative of that  and we should like today to pay him the sincere tribute due him.197.	In undertaking last year an evaluation of the situation in the world  all of us agreed with the Secretary- General that the world was ""perilously close to international anarchy"".198.	More than six months ago the heads of State and Government of the non-aligned countries  at their seventh Conference  solemnly reconfirmed the details of that view. What we called the ""New Delhi Message"" contained an urgent appeal for a general heightening of awareness. It advocated at the same time concerted action to restore peace and security and to promote development in harmony.199.	We see today that although the diagnosis was confirmed  it has not been followed by any concerted action. We see absolutely none of the changes we had hoped for in the attitudes and conduct which in fact originally led to the state of disorder and anarchy which we are living through today. On the contrary  we note a decline in the world situation and an exacerbation of the dangers threatening mankind as a whole. We see that there is an upsurge of violence in all its forms  in terms of a systematic recourse to force on the pretext of security  ideology  retaliation  pre-emption or plain intimidation; a recrudescence of localized conflicts  declared or latent  gravely threatening regional equilibrium; and the undertaking of military operations which are as dangerous as they are futile.200.	We know that force cannot provide a lasting solution of any dispute  and that in any case it has never provided a solution for deep-rooted problems which remain complete and intact.201.	We know that there is a people still condemned to wandering  that another is still groaning under the yoke of colonialism and segregationist  and that in various places on all the continents the rights of States  peoples and individuals are being violated  that insecurity reigns everywhere  even on board civilian aircraft of regular airlines.202.	We note that within this context and within this kind of logic  arms become the expression and the means of a policy becomes a so-called imperative necessity  while at the same time hunger  disease and poverty are stalking throughout the world and the economic crisis  with its particularly disastrous consequences for developing countries  is assuming global dimensions.203.	It is for all the world as if the powerful protagonists in this world have adjusted themselves to the prevailing anarchy on the international scene  exploiting it to strengthen their own positions  to consolidate their gains  to expand their zones of operation  interest or influence  to organize anarchy to their own advantage  to arm themselves and over-arm themselves  invoking various pretexts or theories  each one less convincing than the last  disregarding the coming holocaust  giving precedence to selfish national concerns and immediate interests over any consideration of ethics or respect for the unanimously acknowledged principles of law. During this period  when confidence has disappeared from international relations  this is what seems to determine the attitudes and conduct of the most powerful.204.	We are even impelled to consider whether the world has not finally entered a stage when the levers of command are pulled at the dictates of circumstance rather than as the result of deliberate policy. This is a frightening thing in the nuclear age.205.	The time has come for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  to which all of us here have subscribed  to be brought back into force and scrupulously observed. The time has come to accept that the United Nations is the sole instrument which can save us from chaos  anarchy and war. We must give the widest possible hearing to the appeal of the Secretary-General  who  shouldering his responsibilities with a courage and frankness to which I should like to pay tribute  did not hesitate in his report to this session in calling us to recognize our responsibilities and inviting us to renew our faith in the principles of the Charter and our commitment to the Organization.206.	But over and above this profession of faith to which we have been invited  we must of course give deeper thought to specific measures that could restore to the United Nations its prestige and credibility.207.	It is necessary for the members of the Security Council  particularly the permanent members  to recognize that their responsibility in the matter of international peace and security is as much a collective as an individual responsibility. They are responsible to all the Members of the Organization and to the international community for the use they make of the powers conferred upon them.208.	It is necessary for the permanent members to accept the fact that improvements in the functioning of the Council are necessary to ensure that its action is effective. It is also necessary that the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization apply itself seriously to its work and at last present us with its recommendations with a view to rationalizing our working methods and enabling the Organization to fulfil its responsibilities properly  particularly with regard to international peace and security.209.	In pleading once again the cause of the strengthening of the United Nations and strict respect for the principles of the Charter  Tunisia is simply acting in accordance with its profound convictions  the first of which is that the United Nations constitutes the sole and ultimate recourse for those of us that are the victims of any violation of the principles which underlie the conduct of international relations. It is also our conviction that it is this Organization that establishes the law and creates international legality  that very legality of which my country has made a watchword and which President Bourguibaâdesirous of giving his own thinking and action the necessary legitimacyâhas always advocated as a basis for the settlement of conflicts throughout the world. Finally  it is our conviction that it is within the framework of the Organization  the objective of which is universality  that the interdependence of our interests  our common destiny  in short  our indispensable solidarity  can find expression and concrete form.210.	This solidarity  which we have always believed to be essential within our own frontiers  is something which we consistently propose beyond our frontiers as the best means of ensuring stability  development and peace  first and foremost in our own region  for our brothers and neighbours in the Arab Maghreb.211.	In this world of disorder and ever growing tension we are happy to note that the action undertaken in our Maghreb region for almost a year now is designed to bring about the easing of tension and the narrowing of differences in a spirit of concord  harmony and complementarity.212.	Thanks to the wisdom of the leaders of the Maghreb  we can assert that it is now generally conceded that the relations between our countries can be based only on the principle of interdependence  that conflicts and crises which affect some inexorably have an effect on the interests of others  and that therefore we must show solidarity concerning the way in which we want to mold our own world for ourselves and for future generations.213.	It is in this spirit  in a process of development  aware of the need to lay the foundations of a solid and lasting edifice  open to all our partners in the region  that we view the Treaty of Friendship and Concord between Tunisia and Algeria  signed on 19 March 1983 by President Habib Bourguiba and President Benjedid Chadli.214.	This act  which we believe to be of historic significance  opens to our eyes the path towards a common future. Freely entered into by the various partners in the whole of the Maghreb  this could constitute a precedent for African  Arab or other regions.215.	In this context  the OAUâwhich at the nineteenth session of its Assembly of Heads of State and Government  held at Addis Ababa from 6 to 12 June 1983  proved to the world its ability to pull itself together and overcome its transient difficultiesâwill find less difficult its work in dealing with the conflict which persists in the north-west region of the continent. Tunisia  for its part  while subscribing to the resolutions of the heads of African States on the question of Western Sahara  which it considers to be important steps in the right direction  will be ready to undertake at any time any action that may be deemed useful.216.	It is in the same spirit and with the same readiness that Tunisia views the other conflicts which have shaken the African continent  and in particular the conflict which is raging in Chad.217.	Bearing in mind that war has been ravaging that brother country for nearly two decades  Tunisia can only exhort the people of Chad to try to act so as to spare themselves the horrors of war  desolation and death and not to allow themselves to be deflected from their proper course  which is that of devoting their efforts to the social and economic development which they so sorely need. It is essential that the language of guns and bombs be replaced by the language of dialogue and negotiation between the parties concerned  on the basis in particular of respect for the principles of sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States.218.	In this regard  the OAU offers a framework which will make it possible to bring back peace and harmony in this sensitive region of our continent. No sign of goodwill should be rejected and no efforts should be spared to achieve this goal.219.	On the African continent there still persists an anachronistic problem which threatens ultimately to become the most resounding failure of this Organization  of the principles it advocates and indeed of international legality itself. This is the question of Namibia  which is still under the yoke of illegal occupation and the worst type of colonialism.220.	After so many concessions by the Namibian people and its sole representative  the South West Africa People's Organization  after proofs of impartiality and balance by the United Nations  no pretext or subterfugeâcertainly not one which would make of the sacred struggle of the Namibian people an East-West issueâis any longer acceptable. We expect of those who bear special responsibility for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  and who so far have not been able to keep the promises they have made us  explanations and indications of their intentions.221.	Similarly  we expect explanations of the action undertaken or to be undertaken to put an end to that major aberration of our time  the inhuman practice of apartheid which the Pretoria regime continues to elevate to the status of a system. We believe that this scourge of mankind constitutes a political  economic and social problem  but also and above all a problem of civilization. To those who are relentlessly waging a genuine struggle for liberation and civilization  to the people of South Africa and its leaders from the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress  we would like to reaffirm here our active support and solidarity.222.	As I said at the beginning of my statement  in this era of tension and conflict no continent is spared.223.	In South-East and South-West Asia there persist conflicts which are a challenge to the Organization and the principles of its Charter. To this day  foreign troops continue to occupy Afghanistan and Kampuchea. The peoples of those two countries are still being prevented from freely exercising their right to decide on their own system of government. It is time for the Afghan and the Kampuchean peoples  as for other peoples  to have restored to them the right to speak.224.	In the Gulf region  for three years now we have witnessed the continuance of a fratricidal and unjustifiable war between Iraq and Iran  with an increase in the cruel loss of human life and property and an exacerbation of the danger to stability and equilibrium throughout the region. In Tunisia we are extremely sensitive to the effects of this murderous confrontation between two peoples which are both so close to us. We call on the leaders of those two brother and neighbour countries to have recourse to peaceful means of settling conflicts  as advocated by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  and in the Charter of the United Nations. We exhort them to bring about peace  peace with honour and dignity  in which there will be no victor and no vanquished.225.	Central America cannot remain outside this interminable list of hotbeds of serious tension throughout the world. We would remind those who are tempted to resort to a show of force and violence that lasting solutions can be brought about only by means of political negotiations between the parties concerned. That is what it will take for this disturbed region of the world to recover peace and stability and for its peoples to consolidate their gains on the way to liberty and independence.226.	If these many conflicts  and others  are a heavy burden on international relations  there is one particular one which from our own standpoint constitutes the most direct and most serious threat to international peace and security. That is the tragedy of the Palestinian people and of that brazier which is the Middle East. That explosive situation is of the gravest concern to us. Indeed  ever since its foundation Israel has constantly and relentlessly pursued the same policy of permanent and systematic violation of the principles and rules of the Charter. The may be resolutions  decisions and recommendations adopted in the United Nations system have remained dead letters  which is very eloquent testimony to the arrogance and disrespect which Israel has ceaselessly shown to the international community.227.	The tragic situation in which Lebanon now finds itself is nothing but the direct consequence of this policy  which is based upon invasion  the occupation of territory and the expulsion of the inhabitants. The most recent phase in the plot concocted against this country is the redeployment of troops by Israel  aimed at making it possible to retain its grip on the south of the country. The previous phase of that plot consisted in sowing the seeds of discord and division among the inhabitants of Lebanon  which has nevertheless so often set us an example of perfect coexistence of communities and religions.228.	That is why we learned with the greatest satisfaction of the cease-fire brought about thanks to considerable and praiseworthy efforts. We hope that the cease-Ore will be consolidated definitively in the Held and that it will be possible to begin on that basis dialogue and negotiations within the framework of national harmony. We also hope the parties will strive to make it possible for this brother people to recover its unity and liberate its territory from Israeli occupation.229.	The same policy is being systematically applied in the occupied Palestinian Arab territories  where the Tel Aviv authorities are feverishly building settlements  and regarding the Arab populations of the territories under Israeli control  whose rights are being violated and whose lands are being requisitioned and expropriated. Everything seems to follow the logic  a logic with implacable objectives: to bring the Palestinian people to their knees by the military elimination of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] and to realize the dream of David Ben Gurion by creating ""the third Kingdom of David""  which would extend from the Nile to the Euphrates.230.	Today  Israel's intentions are secret to no one. Every day brings us further striking proof that the Israeli policy of fait accompli is meant to be irreversible and that this end justifies any means.231.	The destruction of the Iraqi atomic reactor  the annexation of the Golan Heights  the doubling in the space of three years of the number of settlements in occupied Arab territories  the brutality against the Palestinian people and the denial to them of their fundamental rights  the invasion of Lebanon with its train of victims and destruction and the massacres of Sabra and Shatila are all milestones on the path of aggression trod by Israel and are all part of a systematic plan and a deliberate policy. The ultimate objective of Israel is to Judaize the occupied Arab territories before annexing them and to deprive the just cause of the Palestinian people of its strength and meaning and to reduce them to wanderers. 232.	If the situation in the Middle East has seen no progress over the last 30 years that is because the international community has not been capable of considering it reasonably or in its objective reality or of stripping it of the emotional attitudes and feelings which have always constituted the backdrop to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.233.	So long kept outside the political arena  the Palestinians have been the victims of a fallacious concept of the true dimensions of the problem  which has been reduced to a conflict between Israel and the Arab States. Today the Palestinian problem can be seen in its true geopolitical context  and there is a broad consensus which now places it at the very heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict.234.	Unfortunately  however  some people persist in trying to impose their own concept or the overwhelming majority of the international community  thus placing themselves outside universally acknowledged norms. Equating the occupied Arab territories with a res nullis  they are engaging in the use of force  repression and oppression in order to achieve their own objectives  thus defying the Charter and decisions of the United Nations as well as the most elementary rules of international law. This flagrant defiance  based upon blind force  has reached such a level that the Israeli leaders seem no longer to believe in anything but the language of force. Israel has recourse to that language of force on the fallacious pretext that its security is threatened  whereas according to the most enlightened observers Israel is the fourth- ranking military Power in the world.235.	It is scarcely necessary to recall that security is the constant  legitimate concern of all the countries of the region.236.	Just as my country is devoted to international legitimacy  it deplores the extent to which the values reflected in the Charter have eroded. That erosion today causes a State Member of the Organization to act with impunity. We appeal to those who bear the greatest responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security to stand alongside us as vigilant guardians of the values defended by the Charter. We repeat our conviction that any acquiescence or siding with Israel which could promote its policies of aggression  annexation and destabilization in the region strengthens that feeling of impunity  encourages that attitude of defiance and does the greatest possible damage to the Organization.237.	Resolutions adopted by the United Nations provide the elements of a just  comprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict.238.	We are convinced that the United Nations provides an irreplaceable forum to negotiate a lasting peace between the parties concerned. In this context  the appeals for negotiation which have from time to time been made to the Arab countries must  if they are to be realistic and sincere  be addressed above all to the PLO  the sole representative of the Palestinian people  which is the principal party in the conflict.239.	The Arab countries and the PLO have constantly repeated that their desire for peace is sincere and that they are open to any proposal based on justice and right. This desire has been reflected in the past in many statements by Arab and Palestinian leaders. It was made clear again last year  immediately after the tragic events in Lebanon  with the publication of a series of peace initiatives.240.	The Arab world has never refused to consider these initiatives  whether the Franco-Egyptian draft resolution  the Reagan plan"" or the Brezhnev plan "" thus putting a favourable construction on the intentions of their authors.241.	What has been the reaction of Israel  in contrast? It has been a categorical  unreserved refusal to all  a stinging slap in the face to the international community  on the pretext that the Bible confers upon Israel a divine proprietorial right over Palestine.242.	In the face of that refusal  we stand by the resolutions of the United Nations  upon which the Arab States drew abundantly in order to present to the world on 9 September 1982 their initiative known as the Fez plan. That plan  which is based upon international legality as it appears in General Assembly resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947  reaffirms  in different words  the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including the creation of its own State  and entrusts to the Security Council the role of guaranteeing the security of all the States of the region so that they may live in peace and security.243.	Tunisia is convinced that along these lines may be found the way to a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict  as was confirmed by the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September 1983.244.	For the third year in succession the world economy is in the throes of crisis  the most serious since the great recession of the 1930s. It has paralyzed growth and slowed down development. Its consequences are serious for the developing countries. In all of them  production ha& failed to increase for the first time since the war  and per capita income has fallen by about 3 per cent. The prices of commodities  the main expense of many developing countries  and sometimes their only exports  have fallen in real value to their lowest level since 1945. The developing countries' terms of trade  already very precarious  have continued to deteriorate for the fifth year in succession.245.	The contraction of international trade and the proliferation of protectionist measures have had a very bad effect on the most dynamic export sectors of the developing countries  thus worsening their trade deficits and aggravating their balance of payments difficulties.246.	The external indebtedness of practically all the developing countries has reached  and in some cases passed  the danger point  placing certain developing countriesânot only the poorestâon the edge of bankruptcy. Faced with declining export earnings and contracting foreign exchange holdings  most developing countries have been compelled to reduce their imports of capital goods  thus seriously affecting their development programmes.247.	The poor countries of Africa continue to languish in sordid conditions of absolute poverty  hunger and malnutrition  and a large proportion of their populations do not have even the necessary minimum for survival and human dignity.248.	The international environment is far from favourable to strengthening international economic co-operation for development. Certainly  signs of economic recovery have begun to appear in some major industrial countries  but their effects do not yet seem to have made it possible to overcome the prevailing difficulties in the economies of those countries.249.	Inflation  unemployment and recession are the major concerns of the industrial countries  and they are giving rise in those countries to reactions of economic nationalism and protectionism  reflected in a whole array of protectionist regulations and measures improvised to adjust to the prevailing situation. This is also reflected by a contraction in the volume of public development aid  the real value of which  expressed as a percentage of gross national product of the donor countries  was still lower in 1982 than it was at the end of the 1960s.232. The worsening in the terms of trade  the monetary disorder and the rise of protectionism are illustrative not only of the extent of the crisis but of the present system's failure to adapt to the new realities of the interdependence between the economies of different countries.253.	It is undeniable that a global solution must be found to this global economic crisis  a solution which takes account of the legitimate interests of all countries  particularly the weakest  within the framework of a common endeavour and dialogue on an equal footing.254.	We do not believe that market forces  however magical they may be  can overcome the structural crisis through which the world economy is now passing. Nor do we share the optimism of those who believe in the ""automatic fall-out"" from the growth in the industrial countries on the economies of developing countries.255.	We believe that the current recovery can be sustained only if it is supported by a powerful dynamism which takes into consideration  in an equitable manner  the well-understood interests of all countries. This will make it possible to ensure growth and full employment for the industrialized countries and to guarantee to the developing countries conditions for true development within the framework of their legitimate aspiration to establish a new international economic order that is just and equitable.256.	I should like to recall in this regard that the approach advocated at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi  constitutes in our view the most appropriate response to break the deadlock in the North-South dialogue that has existed over the past few years. While envisaging the adoption of a programme of immediate measures to meet the urgent economic difficulties of the developing countries  this approach aims at lumbering global negotiations in two stages  to define and adapt long-term structural measures and reforms  within the framework of a global  egalitarian dialogue.257.	It is for the international community to seize the opportunity  during this session  to launch seriously a constructive dialogue  bringing together developed and developing countries in a common endeavour matching the seriousness of the situation.258.	This is particularly urgent because the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  in which such great hopes were placed  unfortunately generated nothing but frustration and disappointment. Most of our partners in the developed world have in fact refused to debate seriously the new approach proposed. In this regard  the report of the Secretary- General on the work of the Organization	quite rightly notes: ""The opportunity of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was to a large extent allowed to lapse  thus exacerbating political tensions on a range of economic issues"". We believe that it is not too late to remedy this failure  but we have to want to do so and therefore to act by means of a true dialogue  which is the best way of bringing about a settlement of the grave and urgent problems of the world economy  particularly the problems of the developing countries.259.	The continuation of the efforts to launch the North-South dialogue and to ensure its success does not prevent South-South co-operation from being strengthened and diversified further. The developing countries are today fully aware of that. They recently again confirmed this at the second meeting of the Group of 77's Intergovernmental and Co-ordination Committee  of which Tunisia had the honour to act as host at the beginning of this month.260.	We are convinced that the decisions taken on that occasion will have a positive effect not only on co-operation among developing countries but also on international co-operation in general.261.	We are concerned about this mood of disaffection about multilateralism which has grown up over the past few years. The most alarming illustration of this is the ever more serious reduction in the contributions to financing operational activities for development  and particularly to UNDP. We think that the present serious financial crisis of UNDP willâif some large-scale action is not undertaken by the contributor countries to ensure UNDP financing on a foreseeable  sure and regular basisâdeal a fatal blow to this irreplaceable instrument of multilateral co-operation for development.262.	We are happy to take note of the agreement reached on setting up the United Nations Financing System for Science and Technology for Development  and we hope this will encourage all countries to make financial contributions in order to accelerate its entry into force.263.	At a time when the state of the world has aroused concern and anxiety  we are pleased to see the United Nations admitting its 158th Member Stale Saint Christopher and Nevis. We welcome it to our midst. Its admission is a timely occasion to recall the universal nature of the Organization and to strengthen our conviction that it is by means of this international body that the world will find its salvation.264.	Indeed  it is this conviction that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has expressed in making itself the champion of the multilateral approach and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations; it is this conviction that is reflected in the fortunate initiative of Mrs. Indira Gandhi  the chairman of the seventh summit conference at New Delhi  in inviting her counterparts to come here and consult together at the very highest level on the state of the world and this international society  which we should like to see capable of respecting a discipline freely agreed to. Let us hope that we can gird ourselves to restore faith and vigour to this international system  which was established on the basis of so much hard work. Let us be convinced that development  independence  disarmament and peace are closely linked together and that they are our only means of salvation. "
"134",6988,"TUR",38,1983,"ï»¿54.	 I congratulate you  Sir  upon your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I feel certain that your intimate knowledge of the United Nations and your wide experience in international matters will contribute to the success of our deliberations. I wish also to express our appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Imre Hollai  who presided with skill and diligence over the work of the Assembly last year.55.	On behalf of my Government I should like to reiterate our full confidence in the Secretary-General. His wisdom and profound experience are invaluable assets for the Organization. We find that the stimulating analysis of the world situation contained in his report to the General Assembly	deserves the most serious consideration.56.	We also welcome the most recent Member  Saint Christopher and Nevis.57.	For several years we have been meeting in an atmosphere of anxiety and desperation. The scope of the nuclear menace to the human race defies our imagination  and yet we see that the level of resources allocated to the arms race has doubled since the first special session on disarmament in 1978. It has now reached the staggering amount of $800 billion. Ironically  during the same period  the transfer of resources from the developed countries to the developing ones has diminished  both in absolute and relative terms. The awareness of the interdependence which is required to solve global problems is sadly lacking. Tensions  conflicts and preoccupation with narrow national interests dominate the world today. The non-nuclear-weapon countries watch helplessly as the nuclear Powers seem oriented towards a new competition in the arms race. The recourse to force and the threats of the use of force are multiplying. Tens of thousands of people die in armed conflicts every year  and many more are suffering from the devastation and inhumanity engendered by wars.58.	Lebanon is  in this respect  a tragic example. As our attention is focused again on the Middle East  we deeply deplore the events unfolding in that country. The Israeli aggression against Lebanon last year not only has caused vast human losses and untold suffering for the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples  but has also created conditions in which it is extremely difficult to restore peace  stability and national unity in Lebanon. Everything possible has to be done to prevent a civil war. We welcome the recent cease-fire and congratulate all those who contributed to it. Effective supervision of this cease-fire is indispensable  and we urge the Security Council to act without delay in this matter.59.	The present situation in Lebanon is without doubt precarious. National reconciliation and the safeguarding of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon require a radical change of attitude on the part of the countries which have the power to influence developments. Lebanon cannot solve its problems under foreign occupation. The Israeli forces should withdraw promptly and in conditions acceptable to Lebanon. The other forces should also evacuate Lebanon. The continuation of the present situation can only lead to fragmentation and the de facto partition of Lebanon  with adverse consequences for the peace and security of the Middle East as a whole.60.	While the primary concern is with Lebanon at this stage  we cannot overlook the broader problem of the Middle East. This issue is central for the entire international community. The plight of the Palestinian people epitomizes one of the great injustices of our era. The United Nations has been committed from the very beginning to the creation of a Palestinian State and it cannot acquiesce in the usurpation of Palestinian lands by Israel. In particular  effective pressure should be exercised on Israel to put an end to its policies of modifying the demographic character and the institutional structure of the occupied Arab territories. We condemn these policies  which constitute a major obstacle in the search for a peaceful solution.61.	The International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held recently at Geneva  identified the main elements on which a viable and just solution of the problem should be based. We believe that the opportunity provided by the balanced approach of this Conference should not be missed. Turkey has repeatedly made clear its firm stand on the question of Palestine. We again express our support for the valiant Palestinian people and the PLO. We continue to believe that a comprehensive  durable and just settlement can only be based on the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem  on the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and on the safeguarding of the right of every State in the region to live behind secure and recognized boundaries. There can be no valid negotiating process without the participation of the PLO.62.	It is regrettable that the peace initiatives undertaken last year have lost their momentum. We earnestly hope that they will be revived and vigorously pursued. Yet for any effort to succeed there must be a fundamental change in the mentality of the Government of Israel. No country has the right to seek security by creating conditions of complete insecurity for its neighbours  for the region where it is situated and for the whole world. History has shown that the arrogance of military power is very costly for the countries which indulge in it.63.	Since it started three years ago  the war between Iran and Iraq has been a source of profound concern to us. We deplore the heavy loss of life and the destruction it has caused. Its continuation would only aggravate the threat to peace and security in the region  exacerbate in the long run the elements of destabilization and inflict more suffering and devastation. The two countries  with which we have historical ties of friendship  owe it not only to themselves but to the region as a whole to end this armed conflict as rapidly as possible. Turkey took the view from the very beginning that as a neighbour of both countries it was its duty to maintain strict neutrality in the conflict. We have scrupulously adhered to this line and shall continue to do so in the future. We have also taken part in the multilateral efforts to stop the fighting. We have launched individually numerous appeals to the parties and indicated that we are ready to do whatever we can to help the peace process. We appreciate as well the initiatives of other countries and of the Secretary- General. We consider that new efforts should be undertaken to initiate a substantial and coherent peace mission which would have the support of the international community and the confidence of both Iran and Iraq.64.	We continue to be distressed by the situation in Afghanistan. Out of a population of 15 million  about 5 million Afghans now live as refugees in neighbouring countries. Nothing could better illustrate the fact that the Afghan people reject categorically the foreign domination imposed on them by military intervention. We fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to obtain a negotiated settlement. Such a settlement should restore Afghanistan's independence as a non-aligned country  enable the Afghan people to exercise their right to self- determination and ensure the withdrawal of foreign troops and the return home of the Afghan refugees. We appreciate the efforts made by the Government of Pakistan to facilitate a peaceful settlement.65.	We feel equally concerned about the stalemate and the dangerous situation in southern Africa. The illegal occupation of Namibia offends the conscience of the world community. The International Conference in Support of the Struggle of the Namibian People for Independence  held in Paris in April  emphasized the common desire for an early settlement. The efforts made by the Secretary-General during his recent useful visit to South Africa provided a fresh insight into the present situation there and the nature of remaining obstacles to the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. As a founding member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Turkey reaffirms its solidarity with the struggle of the people of Namibia for independence under the leadership of SWAPO. Turkey also shares the dismay of the international community about the lack of progress in the fight against apartheid in South Africa. The contemptible and inhuman practice of apartheid constitutes an affront to mankind.66.	Central America is another region burdened with overt or potential political and economic conflicts. The present serious situation there is a source of particular concern. In fact  any military escalation in the region may have far-reaching consequences for global peace and security. Consequently  we believe that dialogue and negotiations constitute the only sensible way to bring peace and stability to that tormented region. We commend and fully support the recent efforts of the Contadora Group.67.	Kampuchea is another international problem whose parameters have basically remained unchanged. The solution of the problem requires the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea and the recognition of the right of its people to self-determination. A search for a just and comprehensive political solution within this framework should be encouraged. In this respect  the efforts of the members of ASEAN are to be highly commended.68.	I would also like to say a few words about the situation on the Korean peninsula. The division of Korea and the problems of the dispersed families have been painful for all Koreans for more than three decades. We believe that the Korean question should be settled peacefully through direct negotiations between the parties concerned  without outside interference. It is our earnest hope that further efforts will be made to start such a dialogue to reduce tension on the peninsula and pave the way for a peaceful settlement of the question in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and so that the national aspirations of the Korean people may be fulfilled.69.	A just and lasting settlement of the Cyprus question continues to be one of the principal objectives of our foreign policy. The present Turkish Government has concentrated its attention on a rapid resolution of the question and has always firmly supported the intercommunal negotiating process.70.	The Turkish community has also from the very beginning approached the matter constructively. In August 1981 the Turkish-Cypriot side submitted comprehensive proposals on all aspects of the problem. These proposals included a map indicating the Turkish-Cypriot negotiating position on the territorial aspect. It was in the light of this development that I voiced some optimism from this rostrum at the last session. I indicated that as a result of the sustained efforts of the Secretary-General the intercommunal talks were proceeding within a comprehensive framework encompassing fundamental aspects of the Cyprus problem. At the same time  I expressed some concern by saying:""The two communities should now intensify their efforts to reshape their relations within a federal structure. They should concentrate their attention on the dialogue. They should not be swayed by the counsel of those who would prefer a continuation of the conflict for their own selfish endsâ.71.	Unfortunately  the Greek-Cypriot side has been swayed by such counsel. Recently they left the negotiating table and requested a debate in the General Assembly  knowing only too well that the Turkish community  because it has no opportunity to address the General Assembly  would feel extremely frustrated. The result was that the good faith created by uninterrupted intercommunal talks since 1980 was seriously eroded. The one-sided  unbalanced  unfair and unrealistic nature of resolution 37/253  adopted on 13 May 1983  served only to increase the resentment of the Turkish-Cypriot people. The Turkish Cypriots rightly reminded world public opinion that they were as much entitled as the Greeks of Cyprus to exercise the right of self-determination. They have so far chosen to exercise this right with the aim of contributing to the creation of a partnership between the two communities within the context of a federal State. But if the other side rejects this partnership  they will have no choice but to reshape their own destiny themselves.72.	The Turkish Government perseveres in its support for a just and lasting settlement of the question through intercommunal negotiations. We hope that the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about the resumption of the intercommunal talks on the existing mutually agreed basis will be successful  despite the misgivings that we feel about the ambivalent attitude of the Greek-Cypriot side which emerged during the recent controversy within the Greek-Cypriot community. When members of his administration and the political parties supporting him question the good faith of the leader of the Greek community  the Turkish community's suspicions and anxieties should come as no surprise.73.	Only a few days ago President Rauf Denktas informed the Secretary-General that the Turkish-Cypriot side was in favour of the early resumption of the intercommunal talks on the existing mutually agreed basis. Mr. Denktas also suggested that a new summit meeting between himself and Mr. Kyprianou should be arranged under the auspices of the Secretary-General with a view to paving the way to further progress in the intercommunal talks. This constructive attitude on the part of the Turkish-Cypriot side should be seized as a historic opportunity to achieve a negotiated settlement. We hope that through the efforts of the Secretary-General the early resumption of the intercommunal talks on the existing mutually agreed basis will be possible. In this connection  I wish to reiterate our heartfelt thanks to the Secretary- General for his determined and untiring efforts to bring about a solution to the problem through intercommunal talks.74.	At a time when great efforts are being deployed to put the two communities on the road to dialogue and conciliation  the Greek Government unfortunately adopts a negative stand. Only a few days ago the Foreign Minister of Greece declared from this rostrum that a political solution to the question of Cyprus was quasi-impossible. He rejected the very basis of the negotiating process under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In doing so  he accused Turkey.75.	Let me say openly that the historical responsibility for what has happened in Cyprus since 1963 rests squarely with Greece. The present conflict has been the result of the constant political and military intervention of Greece and of her ambition to dominate the island. None other than the Greek Prime Minister himself admits this in his book Mr. Papandreou gives a detailed account of the clandestine shipment of 20 000 Greek officers and men to Cyprus. That was in 1964. Ten years later  it was the late Archbishop Makarios who denounced before the Security Council what he called the Greek invasion of Cyprus.76.	During the years preceding 1981 the Greek Government adopted a more restrained attitude and decided to support the intercommunal talks. This position was reversed by Mr. Papandreou's Government. The latest statement of Mr. Haralambopoulos  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece  confirms that Greece opposes a negotiated settlement.77.	International terrorism remains a priority concern for Turkey  as it should for the entire international community. This scourge takes a high toll of innocent lives  challenges the internal peace and stability of countries  exacerbates international relations and disrupts the conduct of normal diplomatic activities. Turkey was afflicted by a wave of terrorism prior to 1980. We have been able to eradicate it and in the process have discovered that it has substantial foreign ramifications and strong links with arms-smuggling and drug-trafficking operations. The same underground organizations are engaged in all these activities.78.	Although we have been able to deal effectively with political violence and its related activities within the borders of our country  we continue to face another sort of terrorism  now directed against Turkish targets in other countries by Armenian organizations. This type of terrorism can only be suppressed through international co-operation.79.	I dealt at length last year with Armenian terrorism and the propaganda campaign  based on a gross distortion of history  which is behind it. I am not going to repeat what I said then. Let me only point out that since I spoke last year eight Turkish nationals have been killed and more than 50 wounded as a result of Armenian terrorist attacks in various countries. But the victims were not only Turks; there were also French  Yugoslav  United States  Portuguese and German citizens among the murdered and injured.80.	Some countries have reacted resolutely to such criminal acts. They have understood that only a determined stand can prevent the repetition of such terrorist attacks. As a result  in the past year  six terrorists have died while perpetrating their odious crimes. Some others have been arrested and convicted. A number of Armenian terrorists await trial. In contrast  the countries which have faltered by allowing their territory to be used for activities against other countries  have themselves become the hunting ground for all kinds of terrorism.81.	Armenian terrorism is bringing disgrace and shame to the Armenians throughout the world. Those who publicize and glorify the murder of innocent people  of women and children  are providing the best denial of the unfounded Armenian allegations. They show that history repeats itself and that Armenian extremists are again dominated by the urge to commit large-scale massacres as they did in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. We repeat that this violence will lead nowhere and will only bring greater stigma to the Armenians. As we appeal again for greater and more effective international co-operation to combat international terrorism  we also stress that the Armenian militants and those Armenians who support them should overcome their obsession with a myth based on the falsification of history  should stop being oblivious to their own sins  crimes and mistakes and should understand that their political ambitions are nothing but delusions and illusions.82.	The record of the disarmament efforts in the past few years gives us little reason for satisfaction. A mood of pessimism and disillusionment characterizes this period. The ever-increasing incidence of armed conflicts all over the world aggravates the widespread feeling of insecurity and fuels the arms race.83.	The two major nuclear Powers bear a special responsibility in the field of disarmament. They have a pledge  a moral and legal commitment in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to pursue negotiations on effective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date. Success or failure in their efforts will determine the future of mankind.84.	Consequently  the current negotiations at Geneva between the United States and the USSR on strategic and intermediate-range nuclear forces hold vital significance for all of us. A breakthrough in these negotiations can change fundamentally the present strained relationship between the East and the West. Therefore  we welcome and support the new United States proposals for the intermediate-range nuclear force talks at Geneva announced to the General Assembly at the beginning of this session. We sincerely believe that it constitute a very important step and will be instrumental in the elaboration of a fair and equitable agreement in this area. I wish also to express our satisfaction at hearing last night that the new negotiating position referred to as the ""build-down"" proposal is to be advanced by the United States at the strategic arms reduction talks at Geneva.85.	There has recently been an encouraging development. After three years of negotiations and dedicated efforts the follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has reached a successful conclusion at Madrid. The agreement obtained at Madrid in spite of serious obstacles is important. It demonstrates that  even under adverse conditions  understanding and compromise on sensitive issues are still possible.86.	In this context  the loss of innocent lives in the very regrettable incident involving the Korean airliner should be a reminder of the urgent need for collective efforts to reinforce basic rules of safety in civil air traffic with a view to preserving the process of detente from serious and unexpected setbacks.87.	We welcome the agreement reached at Madrid to convene a Conference on Confidence- and Security- building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. We believe that the establishment of confidence among States is a prerequisite for the success of any disarmament initiative. That conference will determine in its first stage a set of militarily-significant  binding and verifiable security-building measures. In our view  the conference will be the first comprehensive endeavour in the field of conventional forces with the aim of initiating a gradual process of disarmament. The mutual and balanced force- reduction talks held at Vienna during the last decade have been limited to central Europe. This new conference will cover the whole of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals. We believe that it will constitute a realistic and promising undertaking.88.	Turkey has always followed the work of the Committee on Disarmament with utmost interest. We hope that next year that unique multilateral negotiating body will be able to accelerate its deliberations on all its agenda items  particularly  the negotiations on chemical weapons.89.	Regarding the world economy  we are still confronted with grave and complex problems. The world economy continues to be under the influence of recessionary forces. Although we are detecting signs of recovery in some of the major developed countries  the danger exists that the trend could be only a temporary one. A cyclical upturn cannot be regarded as sufficient.90.	We need to find solutions to the structural elements of the crisis which has acquired unprecedented proportions. The effects of this deep and prolonged recession have been particularly acute in the developing countries and especially in the poorest among them. While their population grows at a rapid pace  many of them face a fall in their gross domestic product and tremendous increases in unemployment. The very low levels of their production and trade  accompanied by stagnant markets and poor returns on their commodity exports  have weakened the capacity of many developing countries to service their growing external debts.91.	Against this difficult and uncertain background  it is no longer possible to limit ourselves to the palliative measures of recent years. Our problems today require long-term solutions based on the reality of interdependence between North and South. Indeed  no one country or group of countries can provide the answers alone.92.	We have witnessed throughout 1983 a number of summit meetings of the developed and developing countries alike. They have all addressed a wide range of world economic issues  such as the resumption of global recovery and expansion  the financing of renewed growth; the assurance of liquidity for the middle-income countries  the financing of development in the low-income countries  and the revitalization of the international trading system. To our disappointment and  I believe  to the disappointment of many others  these efforts have produced very little. The results have failed to bring any visible relief to the world economy.93.	We more than ever need to intensify co-operative efforts among nations and institutions  both public and private  to overcome our common problems. We cannot afford to be paralysed by inaction. A search for concrete measures must go on in each and every forum that has a chance to succeed. We can venture to proceed in two stridesâone in the short term  the other in the long term. The first would comprise immediate measures and the other structural adjustments  since the management of interdependence is based on the recognition that both its cyclical and structural aspects are parts of the same whole.94.	In this context  we believe that South-South cooperation  that is  economic co-operation among developing countries  can positively contribute to the process of structural adjustment. Turkey  which is actively involved in economic co-operation on a regional basis  fully supports all realistic efforts that would be instrumental in the enhancement of activities in the field of economic co-operation among developing countries.95.	Finally  the key approach  in our view  would be the revitalization of the North-South dialogue and the establishment of responsiveness to changing needs. Present structures were created by human imagination. They can again be changed by human vision.96.	In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm our strong support for the United Nations and the principles of the Charter. We will persist in upholding these principles in our foreign policy and endeavour to enhance to the maximum extent possible the cause of peace and international co-operation. The inadequacies and deficiencies of the United Nations cannot be attributed to the Organization. They are the result of the lack of political will on the part of Member States. We have to maintain our faith in the United Nations. To do otherwise would mean that we have lost faith in the future of mankind. "
"135",7050,"TZA",38,1983,"ï»¿First  Sir  let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Your long diplomatic experience and our proven personal abilities mean that the Assembly is and will be in good hands under your leadership. You have the good wishes of the Tanzanian people as you carryOut this onerous task and you can rest assured of the full co-operation of the Tanzanian delegation throughout your year of office. I should also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for the work he has already done to strengthen the Organization  and in particular for his efforts in southern Africa. As have said from this rostrum previously  the Secretary-General and his staff can do no moreThan to assist us  the Members of the United Nations  to make decisions in the cause of peace and to facilitate the implementation of any decisions we make. United Nations peace-keeping forces can buy time for us. But if we  the Members  and in particular the powerful Members  do not realty want peace or are not prepared to pay even a small price for peace. The United Nations staff canAchieve very little  if anything. Can therefore only thank them  and particularly the able Secretary-General  for their great efforts on our behalf.I last spoke to the General Assembly during the twenty-fifth session in October 1970  devoting the bulk of my speech to the problems of colonialism and racism in southern Africa. Progress have beenmade since then. Angola  Mozambique and the other Territories which were Portuguese colonies at that time are now sovereign nations and Members of this body. So is Zimbabwe. But peace and freedom have not come to our region.The danger that the freedom struggle in southern Africa will be confused by the East-West power conflict has become greater and more obvious. Namibia is still occupied by South Africa  and the tentative movements towards the isolation of apartheid South Africa from the world community which could be discerned during the 1970s are now apparently being reversed. Indeed  far from being forced to the defensive by world pressure  South Africa has been allowed to attack its neighbours with little reaction from the international community  it has received only verbal condemnation in response to its raids into Mozambique and Lesotho  its destabilization activities in those countries and also in Zimbabwe and Zambia and its innumerable aggressive actions against Angola  culminating in the occupation of part of Angolan territory.South Africa's attempts to destabilize its neighbours are intensifying  yet South Africa is treated by many of us as if it were a respectable member of the world community which could be encouraged by constructive engagement into being a good neighbour. And when these countries look for world support  some Members of the United Nations advise that if they would only avoid provoking South Africa they would not suffer from the economic  social and political problems which the South African attacks create for them. The provocation referred to is their open and public opposition to apartheid and the reception of refugees from apartheid South Africa.Unfortunately for South Africa's neighbours  the real provocation they offer is their very existence. The example  especially along Its borders  of Independent nations which proclaim the equality of man and are trying to promote human dignity Is a continual threat to the apartheid regime.The choice facing South Africa's neighbours is therefore very clear: either they become accomplices of this racist regime or they must prepare to defend themselves against its attacks. And the United Nations has either to support them In their defence or to become itself an accomplice of the racist State's attacks on Its own people and its neighbours. In this context the United Nations means all our States  severalty and jointly. Neutrality on racism is immoral and politically unsustainable in the long run.Nor is it only in relation to apartheid that the United Nations has a responsibility to impress Its will upon South Africa. Weâthe United Nationsâhave withdrawn South Africa's mandate for the government of Namibia. After long discussions and consultations the Security Council passed resolution  as ion as five year ago. It will be designed to affect a transfer of power to the people of Namibia and bring an end to the war of liberation being waged there.  South Africa has been constantly stalling and manufacturing new objections to the plan  while the South West Africa People's Organization makes concession after concession m the search for peace.As a result of the Security Council's deliberations  the Secretary-General has recently assumed a central role in the negotiations. Acting on our behalf he visited South Africa. He has reported that the transition plan as set out and negotiated has now been accepted by both sides  but South Africa refuses to begin its implementation because Angola has troops from Cuba helping it to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.I must reiterate once more that Tanzania categorically rejects this attempt to link the independence of Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. We know that South Africa has adopted this policy in the last two years on the encouragement of a permanent member of the Security Council. We know that South Africa is remaining stubborn with the encouragement of that State. Tanzania still says that Angola is an independent sovereign State which has suffered from external aggression from the moment of its birth. It has a right to decide for itself on its defence needs. The attempts to link the independence of Namibia with Angolaâs sovereign decisions has to be rejected by the whole of the United Nations.The people of Namibia have a country  it is the freedom of that country to govern itself that they arefighting for. What they suffer is continued colonialism under South Africa. They do not suffer from homelessness. The non-whites people of South Africa have a country  South Africa. What they suffer are the evils of racial discrimination under apartheid. Even the attempts by South Africa to deprive its black people of their citizenship by the creation of so-called independent homelands are not recognized by the international community. We continue to recognize the right of the people of South Africa to all of South Africa.But the people of Palestine have no home. They are a nation without a country  In 1947  long before Tanzania came into existence  the General Assembly decided that in order to give a homeland to the homeless Jewish people the land of Palestine should be divided into two. That decision had its own complications. Not surprisingly  the Palestinians and other Arabs rejected it and resisted its implementation. But  faced with the background of the suffering of the Jewish people in Europe  the international community proceeded with the Partition Plan. The rationale for that decision was to undo the wrong done to the Jewish people by Hitlerite fascism.Today it is the people of Palestine who are homeless. Even their right to Gaza and the West Bank is disputed. How can humanity tolerate this injustice How can the international community recognize the ""right"" of the Jewish people to a part of Palestine and yet deny the Arab people of Palestine the right to form their own State on at least part of that territory?Tanzania recognizes the State of Israel  but we do not recognize that State's right to deny a homeland to the people of Palestine and to refuse to negotiate with the genuine representatives of that people  the Palestine Liberation Organization. Nor do we recognize Israelâs right to commit aggression at will against its neighbours  occupying large parts of Lebanon and making its withdrawal conditional upon the actions of others.The United Nations promoted the creation of the State of Israel. Both super-Powers were involved  together  in the original decision to divide Palestine. Both have a responsibility to work together  and in concert with the international community  to ensure that the Palestinian people exercise their inalienable right to self-determinationâincluding the right to establish an independent State of their own in Palestine.Let me now turn to a world problem which has very special relevance to and importance for Africa.In the General Assembly  in innumerable other large and small international gatherings and in several international commissions  we have discussed the problems of world poverty  the workings of the world trading and financial institutions and the economic responsibilities of our nations one to another. Yet the harsh truth is that the indecencyânay  the obscenityâof un alloyed poverty is now more widespread and afflicts more people in the world than ever before. The gap between rich nations and poor nations gets larger and larger with every year that passes. And in the last few years many African countries have experienced an objective fail  as well as a relative fail  in an already by many low level of national wealth. Finally  the intimate financial and economic links between third world countries and the developed nations have caused the problems of third world national poverty to impinge with damaging effect on the economies of the wealthy nations.Those are facts. They are indisputable. I think there is general agreement that they are ultimately incompatible with world peace. But when we get to analysing their causes and the actions necessary to change them  then differences arise amongst us; in particular  differences arise between what is now known as the ""economic South"" and the dominant members of the ""economic North"". Furthermore  our discussions have recently become increasingly barren; less and less of substance has resulted from more and more international conferences.Generally  we have concluded our meetings by congratulating ourselves and each other on our speeches and agreeing to meet again in a further attempt to reach a consensus on united action. Occasionally  some individual countries have increased their economic aid to the poor nations or improved the terms of their assistance as a result of a meeting. But at different times  other States have decreased their aid or worsened its terms. In any case  the substance and the basis of the economic relations between our States have only on the rarest occasions been made noticeably better by our meetings  Indeed  judging by the evidence of the economic crisis which now grips the whole world  these relations have got worse. Meanwhile  the present international systems and institutions have proved less and less able to fulfil the functions of promoting trade and prosperity throughout the world. Where are we going wrong?At our conferences we meet as Governments. This is natural because there are decisions to be made. Our purpose is to discuss a problem and find a solution. But each of us begins by stating our own position on it we think is wrong and what kind of action  if any  we are prepared to support. From these fixed positions we proceed to bargain. In committees and in the corridors of our conferences we discuss who will give way a little on one thing and what they will demand in return. In a large gathering there are usually the ""hard-liners"" and sometimes the ""mediators"" in between them. The result is either an apparent triumph for the most intransigentâ an intransigence which will be meaningless unless the stubborn Government also has powerâor a fudged consensus  subject to a dozen different interpretations  with little if any resulting action. For we have met an opponents and we part as opponents  whether or not we claim victory or regard the outcome of our meeting as a defeat.Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that we have many common international economic goals. It also appears likely that positively directed discussion could lead to agreement on how we can work together to fulfil them.First  all nationsâcapitalist  socialist  agricultural  industrial  poor and richâwant and need some kind of international economic stability. Business organizations  whether public or private  prefer to have some advance knowledge of their future costs of production and the quantities of raw materials likely to be needed or available. The longer the gestation period for an investment  the more important stability becomes for those considering such investment. Workers also want an assurance that they will be back to earn their living in the future.So the priority issue for all of us is the creation  or re-establishment  of that economic stability which is a necessary basis for our future welfare. in the 1950s and 1960s this job was done  to at least a reasonable extent  by IMF and other Bretton Woods organizations. Clearly  they no longer fulfil that function. They are still in existence  yet there is no stability and even less economic progress.Secondly  none of our nations wants famine and starvation  epidemics and plagues  or the consequential social unrest and war  anywhere in the world. These evils can no longer be confined within national boundaries; their effects overflow into countries even thousands of miles away. We must tackle the problem of world poverty together. The question for us all is not whether we should do so but how we can act together more effectively.Thirdly  all of usârich and poor nationsâwant to increase the wealth produced and available to our own people. Whether we are elected or not  all our Governments know that we have a greater chance of avoiding trouble when our people are enjoying a rising standard of living  and vice versa. And all of us know  I think  believe that social unrest in another country can affect our own nation if we normally trade with it or for other reasons have close contact with it.This legitimate interest in each other's progress and welfare does not give any nation the right to interfere politically in the affairs of another State. It implies  however  that in the longer run we all suffer if the international economic system affects the rewards which a particular type of economy or worker can earn. It means that we would all benefit from a system which facilitates the prosperity of those to whom we might wish to sell and which safeguards our creditors âability to repay us by producing and selling goods. Economically  an impoverished customer is no good to a shopkeeper  a destitute man is no use to a farmer and a bankrupt creditor is a disaster for a bank.These Interests we all have in common  all of us. But at present It is not clear whether  In the face of the current world economic crisis  the rich nations still understand that they are unavoidably linked with the poor. For we hear of economic projections and of action programmes which talk as if recovery from the present recession must start among the rich  internally and amongst themselves. The poor nations  it is said  will then be ""pulled up"" byâand afterâthe rich  when these have overcome their own problems of unemployment  low demand and low production. In the meantime  It is suggested that the transfer of resources from the poor must be reduced in real terms and that any sizeable increase in international liquidity must be rejected for fear of its possible inflationary effects upon the rich countriesThis talk  and the actions based on it  provides another example of the failure to look at world problems from a world perspective  to the ultimate detriment of rich as well as poor. In 1980 the Brandt Commission report spoke of the urgent need for international action to avert the dangers of economic  social and political collapse in many of the third world countries  with consequential implications for peace in the world and prosperity in the developed nations. It made proposal  which have not been implemented.Earlier this year a second report was published by the Commission. This also made proposals  practical proposal drawn up by people who come from North and South and have diverse ideological approaches to economic problems. Judging by the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade from 6 June to 2 July 1983  and many other indications  it appears that once again we are going to ignore their hard work and their success in reaching agreement on matters of substance. Yet the events of 1980 to 1983 have borne out the first analysis of the Brandt Commission. There has been social upheaval and financial or economic crisis  along with political unrest and shifting alliances  In many poor countries of the world.Also  ""economic recovery"" in the developed nations keeps ""beginning""âand being put back by the threat of some new disaster in the third world  or some new and economically Induced change in the pattern of world political relationships.In pointing to these facts It is not my intention to attribute bad faith to the people of any nation or to any leader  still less to abuse any of them. Just as the world is overflowing with examples of avoidable misery  destitution  and death  so it is full of examples of human generosity to other human beings. The problem does not Be In the deliberate inhumanity of people in the richcountries  nor in the malevolence of the world's leaders. It lies in our failure to recognize that the problem of the poor nations is but partâalbeit a very urgent partâof a common and joint world problem. This requires action from all of us according to our relative strength.Even the priority part of the problem which relates to the poor countries itâs not simple. Nor is it a single problem. We  the poor  are frequently told of the millions of dollars which have been ""poured Into"" our countries. And some economic aid has been given. Our failures and our mistakes are pointed out to usâand they do exist. For the whole programme Is  In historical terms  In its infancy. We are all  donor and recipient countries  lenders and borrowers alike  learning how to develop a nation In the 20th century world by trying to develop. We are all learning to walk by walking. And simultaneously with the deliberate transfer of resources to the third world through aid  concessional loans or private Investment  there is an automatic and unnoticed transfer of resources from the poor third world to the rich nations as debts are repaid with Interestâsometimes very high interestâas profits of third world enterprises are paid out for disbursement elsewhere and as the terms of International trade move relentlessly against the primary producers.The economic crisis and Imbalance In the world does exist. There is widespread unemployment in the North and ever slower economic growth rates; international debt crises threaten the whole structure of world trade and finance; the least developed countries get even poorer and their prospect of future advance gets fainter. At the same time  the North-South negotiations have stagnated  and there are some who would rather that there were no global negotiations. Where do we go from here What is the way out of the morass Into which we seem to be blunderingThis world problem could be solved only by all nations working together. That is why we  the poor  have been appealing to the great nations of the world to permit meaningful global negotiations to take place. We are still appealing to them to do this  so that together we can find genuine solutions to our common problems. But if some nations cannot see that it is a world problem or do not feel able at present to join in the work of tackling it  then the rest of us must do what is within our  capacity in as large or small a group as we can gather together for that purpose.The Bretton Woods institutions were established without the Soviet Union and its allies. For some twenty years they served the purposes of their original members. Today it is quite clear that these institutions cannot meet the needs of the poor  and therefore they are not able efficiently to serve the interests of the rich in our independent world. Their failure is partly because they do not have the necessary funds  but more because neither their structure nor their rules were intended to deal with the problems of poverty.The world has changed since then. Change is needed now to enable these institutions to tackle theproblems of the developing as well as of the developed countries. if we cannot all work together to meet the needs of the 1980s  then it those governments of North and South which recognize the need for action get together to do as much as they can. It is not necessary to close any doors against nations which are not ready now. But we should not continue to allow any nation or nations  however powerful  to prevent the rest of us from doing what is within our power to arrest the present drift to disaster.Tackling the economic problems of the modern world means recognizing the interdependence of all nations  and it means using some of the world's resources more than we are using now for investment in the development of people and their creativity and productivity.Finally  it means tackling poverty and backwardness directly  where they are  that is  in the third world  and on the principles of organic growth. We must accept that results will not and cannot come quickly. They will be slower the fewer the nations which co-operate in these tasks. t is better that a few nations should act than that there should be no action at all. Nevertheless  I am making an earnest appeal for the start of global negotiationsnow  under the auspices of the United Nations.We  the poor  are often asked where these extraresources are to come from. This world does not lackresources; it only tacks the political will to tackle theindecency of world poverty. When a super-Power or awealthy nation  or even a comparatively wealthy nation decides that something is necessary  it usually does it.Resources wimp not be available unless the rich decide thatthe abolition of world poverty is a matter of priority.Although the national income in the rich countrieshas been rising throughout the past two decades and isstilt rising  although now more slowly  virtually none ofthat increase has Seen set aside for the relief of povertyin the third world. For example  the percentage of theirgross national product used by countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Developmentfor this purpose was lower in 1978  and is lowernow  than it was in 196. The suggestion that when therecession is ever an attack can be made on world povertyIs thus act very convincing.According to theWorld Bank's World Development Report for 1983  in1981 the net inflow of public products guaranteedloans to 34 low-income countries  including India andChina  amounted to just over 35 billion. Net direct privateinvestment was something like $300 million  almost halfof which was it a country in that category which is anoil producer.40.	That brings me to my last point. What is this?defence expenditure to which we a give so high a priority AH nations  including the poorest  spend somemoney for armaments and defence  but over half the totalworld expenditure is made by the super-Powers  and asizeable proportion of the rest is accounted for by theirallies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization.41.	Some people believe that the mutual deterrentcapacity of the power blocs is a contribution to peace but if that is true then the purpose has been achieved.Bach power bloc has the capacity to destroy the otherand all of us together many  many times. Yet a man woman or child can be kilted only once. Military superiority over a nation's potential or feared adversary doesnot require an ability to kill its entire people eleven timesover  rather than ten times over.42.	Some of us see a constant world danger in thenumber of weapons which are placed or fly or float ormove under water  ready to go off at any minute on anyday. That danger would be reduced by the destructionof some of the weapons which already exist.43.	Negotiating disarmament is not a simple matter even if the will to do so exists. A nuclear freeze  however would provide a basis from which serious negotiation fordisarmament could be advanced  for at the moment newweapons are being produced faster than agreement isbeing reached on the control of old ones.44.	The difficulty about disarmament is first and foremost the lack of trust among nations and among men.Their distrust may be fed by many things  but I believeit has fear as its root. When either Moscow or Washington makes a new disarmament proposal  the first andimmediate reaction of the other is suspicion. Surety itwould be more constructive to react to any new initiativefrom the other side by responding with agreement todiscuss the idea together to see if it can be made to work.And do these proposals have to be made publicly Apublic proposal requires a public answer. But is this thebest way of conducting such vital matters as nucleardisarmament45.	A positive approach is required if any internationalproblems are to be solved. We all inhabit one planet.Neither nuclear fall-out  nor bubonic plague  nor theviolence borne of frustration nor even the miseries ofavoidable famine can be confined within national boundaries or within continents. Development  disarmament the environment  all are world problems even while wesee them from the viewpoint of our Independent sovereignStates. They can and they must be dealt with by us allworking together  for at the lowest we can all harmeach other and at the highest we could all benefit fromco-operation on the bests of equality.46.	If we so decide  the United Nations can be a majorinstrument of peace  peace based on tackling world problems as what they are: the common problems of a common humanity.47.	We may not like each other. We may distrust eachother. But neither liking nor distrust is relevant  in thistwentieth century our nations have to work together inorder to survive. The alternative is to die. ail or us  andail our peoples. The choice is ours: co-operation slowlyand painfully built up  or inevitable and pervading chaosand insecurity and disaster.48.	Let us decide to work together for the good ofhumanity. "

I take this opportunity also to pay a special tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Hungarian People's Republic  who displayed remarkable statesmanship and skill in his leadership of the thirty-seventh session. It was a pleasure for my delegation to serve as one of his Vice-Presidents.113.	May I express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts in the service of the Organization and in trying to ensure that it fulfils its ideals and objectives. I assure him that in these efforts  he can count on the full support and encouragement of Uganda. We recall with pleasure the Secretary-General's visit to Uganda in February of this year.114.	I congratulate most warmly the Government and people of Saint Christopher and Nevis on their attainment of independence. We welcome this new nation to the United Nations and look forward to a relationship of friendship and co-operation.115.	Since I addressed the Assembly at the last session  the general international situation hascontinued to deteriorate. Of particular concern to my country is the situation in southern Africa  which has become ever more grave and dangerous.116.	Although there exists a global consensus on the urgent need for independence for Namibia  the attainment of this goal has continued to elude us. Last August  in accordance with the mandate given to him by Security Council resolution 532 (1983)  the Secretary-General held consultations with the front-line States and South Africa. His report shows that almost all outstanding issues envisaged in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and in the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia have been resolved  yet the prospects for the early implementation of resolution 435 (1978) remain as bleak as ever.117.	South Africa  with the encouragement of the United States  insists on the extraneous and irrelevant issue of linkage between the independence of Namibia and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. As we have had occasion to state before  the question of independence for Namibia is a clear-cut colonial issue  whereas the presence of Cuban troops in Angola is a bilateral arrangement between two sovereign States.118.	Uganda rejects all attempts to cast the struggle for liberation and the decolonization process in the mould of East-West rivalry. We are disturbed that the United States  which is a member of the Western contact group and which should be using its full weight to press for South African withdrawal from Namibia  has instead invested its efforts in forging a linkage never contemplated by the United Nations plan.119.	Meanwhile  South Africa has taken advantage of the lull in the process of negotiations to intensify repression in Namibia and stifle the legitimate aspirations of the Namibian people. It has continued to hatch fraudulent schemes and impose puppet leaders for the sole purpose of preventing the inevitable victory of the Namibian people under the leadership of SWAPO.120.	We reiterate our view that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only basis for a peaceful settlement of the question of Namibia. We call on the Security Council to resume its responsibility fully in connection with the implementation of that resolution. We reject all concepts of linkage  by whatever name they may be called.121.	In South Africa itself the apartheid regime continues the ruthless oppression and exploitation of the vast majority of people of that country. State-sanctioned violence  arbitrary arrests  intimidation and assassination of opponents of apartheid and the policy of creating bantustans are all aspects of the machinery of oppression that thrives in South Africa. Last June we were horrified that in spite of the appeals of the Security Council  the General Assembly and many Governments around the world  the South African authorities proceeded with the execution of three freedom fighters  members of the African National Congress.122.	We have always warned that the South African racist regime was sitting on an active volcano. That volcano is now showing signs everywhere of erupting. Mere cosmetic changes such as the so-called constitutional reforms will not prevent that eruption. The only preventive measure against total eruption and a consequent blood bath is the complete eradication of the evil system of Those who continue to collaborate with the racist regime must share responsibility for the violence that is escalating in South Africa.123.	Recently my delegation learned with great concern about reports that the United States Department of State had approved a request from seven United States companies to provide technical and maintenance services for a South African nuclear-power installation near Cape Town. We can neither understand nor accept this development. We call on the United States Government to respond positively to the appeals already issued by the Group of African States and the Chairman of the Special Committee Against  apartheid calling for the revocation of this approval.124.	There is need to ensure full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 418 (1977) on an arms embargo against the racist	regime.125.	South Africa has continued unabated its campaign of destabilization against the front-line States. Last May South Africa launched a major air raid into Mozambique. South Africa continues to occupy the southern territory of Angola and recently a massive air and ground attack was carried out further inside Angola. Lesotho is being subjected to great pressures from South Africa. The other front-line States all continue to feel the impact of South Africa's campaign of destabilization. We appeal to the international community to give all assistance to the front-line States  which are paying a high price for their commitment to the liberation of southern Africa.126.	It is clear to Uganda that the illegal occupation of Namibia  the policy of apartheid and South Africa's acts of aggression against the front-line States all constitute a serious threat to international peace and security  for which the Security Council should impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa.127.	The Government and people of Uganda remain unequivocally committed to the total liberation of southern Africa. We salute the people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole and authentic representative  and the liberation movements of South Africa  for their courage and determination in the struggle against the racist apartheid regime.128.	Uganda remains deeply concerned about the dangerous situation in the Middle East. Recent developments in Lebanon underline the need to address urgently all aspects of the Middle East problem. Since its inception  the United Nations has sought a negotiated and peaceful settlement to the Middle East conflict  yet the conflict continues to escalate in all its manifold dimensions. The failure to achieve a settlement has not arisen because the international community has been oblivious to the primary causes of the conflict. In numerous resolutions the Assembly has reaffirmed that the full realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people is a prerequisite for the attainment of a comprehensive  just and lasting solution and  consequently  a durable peace in the region.129.	Failure to reach a settlement stems from the fact that Israel has repeatedly spurned and rejected the resolutions of the United Nations. Israel has chosen instead the dangerous option of aggression  conquest  annexation and the denial of the political  economic and social rights of the Palestinian people. The time has come for the United Nations to take affirmative action aimed at restoring the rights of the Palestinian people. In this connection Uganda fully endorses the Geneva Declaration on Palestine  which was adopted recently at the International Conference on the Question of Palestine? The Declaration provides a good basis for beginning the process of a negotiated settlement in the Middle East.130.	Developments in Central America give us cause for great concern. We cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of the peoples of that region. We maintain the view that the peoples of Central America should be left to determine their own destinies freely without any outside interference. In this connection we commend and support fully the efforts of the Contadora Group.131.	On the question of Cyprus  we note with deep regret that  in spite of the commendable efforts of the Secretary-General  a solution seems far away. We believe that any settlement of the question of Cyprus must ensure the unity  sovereignty  independence and non-aligned status of that country.132.	Uganda continues to support the aspiration of the Korean people to the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. The division of the Korean peninsula is an injustice that must be rectified through early reunification  freely achieved and without any external interference. We welcome the special efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea towards the achievement of this goal. 133.	We are saddened by the continuing conflict between Iran and Iraq. We once again appeal to the two countries to bring this tragedy to an end.134.	My delegation reaffirms its support for the struggle of the Saharan people for genuine self-determination in accordance with the framework formulated by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its nineteenth session  held at Addis Ababa last June. We appeal to the parties to the conflict to abide by the OAU consensus.135.	The arms race continues at a very dangerous pace. The level of resources devoted to it has now reached the astronomical figure of $800 billion. This figure contrasts sharply with the steep decline in the resources being allocated for economic and social development. The production  stockpiling and deployment of weapons of all types have increased dramatically.136.	It is clear that the escalating tension between the two super-Powers is most dangerous to international peace and security. We appeal to the super-Powers to exercise maximum restraint for the sake of peace in the world  the peace on which everything else depends.137.	We recognize the peculiar and vital position of the major Powers in any negotiations concerning disarmament. We call upon them to respond to the calls for the rapid conclusion of arms reduction agreements. We also call upon them not to extend the arms race from the earth to outer space.138.	At the last session of the General Assembly we expressed our deep concern at the alarming dimensions of the global economic crisis. One year later  I very much regret to say that the world economic situation has continued to deteriorate. The spirit of international cooperation in the economic and social sectors has waned. Today the crisis in international economic relations is a major source of instability in many countries and a real threat to world peace and security. Although the crisis has to varying degrees affected all countries  it has hit the developing countries hardest  particularly the least developed among them. The recession which continues to grip the world economy has worsened the living conditions of millions of people in the developing countries.139.	The efforts which the developing countries have made to find meaningful solutions to the structural crisis facing the world economy have been met with lukewarm or negative responses by the major industrialized countries. The initiative of the developing countries concerning the launching of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development has not yet  after four years  yielded the desired results  precisely because some developed countries have been reluctant  for short- term gains  to generate the necessary political will.140.	My delegation shares the firm conviction expressed by the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi  with regard to these negotiations  namely  that they remain the most important and comprehensive endeavour of the international community to restructure international economic relations  accelerate development of the economies of the developing countries and strengthen multilateral economic co-operation on the basis of mutual benefit.141.	It is  therefore  regrettable that the flexibility shown by the developing countries in the negotiations ha? not been matched by a positive and concrete response from the major industrialized countries  which have remained silent on the latest proposals of the developing countries. We hope that this session will witness the launching of the global negotiations  in accordance with the two-phase approach proposed at New Delhi by the Conference of non-aligned countries.142.	The dismal outcome of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has been a source of deep disappointment to my delegation. The failure of the Conference to reach agreement on all the major issues on its agenda  in spite of the far- reaching concessions made by the Group of 77  is a bad omen for the future of international economic co-operation. The sixth session provided a golden opportunity to find meaningful solutions to current global economic problems  but the opportunity has  tragically  been lost because of intransigence on the part of a few delegations. The results of the session have certainly placed in jeopardy the future of UNCTAD and the negotiations on trade  development and related issues. This session must salvage what is clearly a desperate and untenable situation and take the necessary corrective measures to redress the situation. My delegation is ready and willing to play a positive role in such efforts  and urges all countries to adopt a constructive spirit in this regard.143.	The specific problems of the least developed countries  the land-locked and island developing countries  have continued to worsen and escape solution. Whereas the economic outlook of the developing countries in general is bleak  that of the least developed countries is calamitous. Many of the least developed countries are today on the verge of collapse owing to the disastrous effects of the global crisis on their small and weak economies. While Uganda welcomes the commitment which all countries reaffirmed at Belgrade to the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries  we make an urgent appeal for the speedy implementation of the Programme  so that the economic deterioration of the least developed countries is arrested before the situation becomes completely hopeless.144.	As a net energy importer  Uganda attaches great importance to new and renewable sources of energy. We find it regrettable that not only has the enthusiasm which greeted the 1981 United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy dissipated  but practically no progress has been made in implementing the major decisions of the Conference and in: 3aching agreement on the outstanding issues. We therefore hope for an early decision on these matters.145.	Uganda remains committed to economic co-operation among developing countries as a vital means of achieving collective self-reliance. We consider it to be a key component of the new international economic order as well as a means of enhancing economic and political stability in the developing world. Against the background of current economic problems and the deadlock in North- South negotiations  economic co-operation among developing countries provides a most important avenue for the development of developing countries. We shall continue to exert every effort to promote the achievement of the objectives and goals of economic co-operation among developing countries.146.	The economic development and progress of the developing countries is part and parcel of the search for lasting world peace and security. The role which the United Nations has played in the past in this regard is commendable. We hope that Member States  individually and collectively  will enable the Organization to continue to play this role as we pass through this most difficult period the world economy has experienced in the last 50 years.147.	In this connection  the call made by the heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at their seventh summit conference for the convening of an international conference on money and finance for development is a timely one and deserves the full support of the General Assembly. The need for a thorough restructuring of the international monetary and financial system in order to correct existing imbalances and inequalities in that system has long been recognized. The time has now come for concrete action to be taken.148.	I wish on behalf of the Government and people of Uganda to reaffirm our full support for the purposes and principles of the United Nations and for the efforts which the Organization is making to maintain world peace and security and to promote international cooperation in the economic and social fields."
"137",7140,"UKR",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	I warmly congratulate Mr. Illueca on his election to the important post of President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I wish him and the Secretary-General every success in their work.2.	We are extremely grateful to the President of the thirty-seventh session  My. Hollai  for the work he did.3.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR wishes to congratulate Saint Christopher and Nevis on its admission to membership in the United Nations.4.	The current session of the General Assembly is taking place at a difficult and troubled time  a time crucial to the future of mankind. In an international situation of acute tension what is needed is a sober and objective analysis of current alarming trends in international relations and sensible conclusions consistent with the ultimate interests of mankind.5.	Nevertheless  this approach is being rejected by the aggressive imperialist circles of the United States. They have openly embarked on a policy based on a position of strength and on interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States. The arms race they have unleashed  an unprecedented military build-up  large-scale programmes for manufacturing all kinds of weaponsânuclear  chemical and conventionalâand plans to extend the arms race to outer space are  in effect  incontrovertible proof that the United States is creating the material basis for war. Vast sums already running into trillions of dollars are being allocated to finance the United States military build-up.6.	The plans to deploy new United States medium-range missiles on the continent of Europe are extremely dangerous. In practice  their implementation would mean the creation of a first-strike capability in the immediate vicinity of vital centers of the USSR and other Warsaw Treaty countries. It would appear that those who intend to do thisâand they are the very ones promoting the idea that nuclear war is possible or even admissibleâare prey to the illusion that if these missiles are launched against Soviet targets from Western European countries rather than from United States territory  then it would be those countries that would be the targets of retaliation. In acting in this way  Washington is making the countries and peoples of Western Europe its nuclear hostages.7.	The programmes for developing and manufacturing the very latest weapons systems  which are being formulated and implemented in the United States  are aimedat disrupting the existing parity of forces between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [M47TO] and the Warsaw Treaty countries and at securing a dominant world position for the United States. Such an open militaristic course poses a serious threats to peace  heightens international tension and is edging the world towards a nuclear conflict and increasing the risk of nuclear war.8.	In order to justify its militaristic course and its further escalation of tension  the United States Administration has invented the myth of a Soviet military threat  has proclaimed a crusade against socialism as a social system and is trying by its actions to transfer ideological differences onto the plane of relations among States. Mr. Yuri Andropov  General-Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  said on 28 September that such actions are absurd and inadmissible  especially now in the nuclear age [see9.	The realities of the existing international situation call for particular restraint in all spheres of relations among States  above all when the interests of countries with differing social systems are involved.10.	In the present extremely acute and tense international situation  no task is more urgent or important than that of preserving peace and preventing nuclear war. The very survival of life on earth depends on accomplishing that task  There is no doubt but that the United Nations has an important part to play in this noble undertaking.11.	The thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly must make its own contribution to curbing the arms race and normalizing the international situation. It would be entirely logical if this session were to focus its attention on such central issues as the prevention of nuclear war  an early halt to the arms race  the prevention of the spread of that arms race to new areas  and movement towards disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament. There is no other reasonable or reliable way of solving these urgent priority problems than to hold honest negotiations and to explore and find mutually acceptable solutions.12.	Numerous foreign-policy initiatives of the Soviet Union and other Socialist countries have created a concrete and practical basis for taking urgent action to prevent nuclear war  curb the arms race  bring about disarmament  eliminate hotbeds of tensions and improve the international political climate.13.	Of undying historic importance is the unilateral obligation assumed by the Soviet Union not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and its appeal to the other nuclear Powers to follow suitâsomething to which  most regrettably  the United States and its nuclear partners have hot yet responded  although the renunciation of the first use of nuclear weapons by all the nuclear Powers would in effect mean that the possibility of nuclear war could be ruled out altogether.14.	The new Soviet proposal to include in the agenda of the thirty-eighth session an important and urgent item entitled  Condemnation of nuclear war has been dictated by the same profound concern for thedestinies of the world and for the prevention of nuclear war. Nuclear war must be condemned resolutely  unconditionally and for all time. Any ideas involving the admissibility of nuclear war are criminal and should be subject to the severest condemnation. We strongly advocate the adoption of a United Nations declaration specifically devoted to the condemnation of nuclear war.15.	The Ukrainian SSR believes that proposals to freeze nuclear arms and to reduce them substantially on the basis of equality and equal security are important for the limitation of arms. A simultaneous quantitative and qualitative nuclear arms freeze by either all the nuclear Powers or  initially  by the United States and the Soviet Union as an example to the other nuclear States would undoubtedly increase the  degree of trust among nations and would help in practical terms to move towards breaking the vicious circle of the arms race. This noble goal is pursued by the Soviet Union proposal that the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly adopt a resolution entitled  Nuclear-arms freeze. We hope it will win wide support from States Members of the Organization.16.	Strategic programmes for militarizing outer space  being developed and implemented in the United States  are causing grave concern. A programme for developing outer-space attack systems designed to destroy targets in outer space and on earth is being carried out. Outer-space combat systems are seen as a key element of a first-strike capability.17.	The Ukrainian SSR fully shares the conclusion that the development of various kinds of outer-space arms and weapons systems will make international arms control  limitation and reduction agreements much more difficult to achieve. The stationing of arms in outer space will constitute yet another broad channel of the arms race. That is why any plans to turn outer space into a source of mortal danger to mankind must be securely blocked. The draft international treaty on the prohibition of the stationing of weapons of any kind in outer space  proposed in 1981 by the Soviet Union ' serves that very purpose. In order to prevent the militarization of outer space  the USSR has submitted to the current session a proposal entitled  Conclusion of a treaty on the prohibition of the use of force in outer space and from outer space against the Earth.18. Outer space must not be allowed to become a source of danger of war and an arena for conflict and confrontation. It must remain free from any weapons. We believe that the current session of the General Assembly must bring to bear the weight of its authority in favour of finding a solution to this extremely urgent problem as soon as possible.19.	A well-founded comprehensive programme of measures to limit and reduce arms  particularly nuclear arms  has been proposed by the Warsaw Treaty countries in their Prague Political Declaration  of particular significance is the proposal container m that document that the NATO countries should conclude a treaty with the Warsaw Treaty countries on the mutual non-use of military force and on the maintenance of relations of peace between these two groupings. In essence  this proposal means the renunciation of the first use of both nuclear and conventional weapons and  hence  the renunciation of the use of military force against each other in general. Unfortunately  not everyone has yet realized that such a treaty  if signed  would considerably improve the situation in Europe and in the world as a whole and would have a substantial positive impact upon the ongoing negotiations on the limitation of arms and  equally important  would be conducive to the creation of a climate of trust.20.	The task of eliminating the threat of nuclear war calls for urgent efforts in all areas. This applies above all to the most acute problem of the limitation and reduction of strategic arms and the limitation of nuclear arms in Europe. The United States Administration has taken an obstructionist stand on these major issues and is seeking to acquire military superiority while attempting to use negotiations as a cover for its moves aimed at a military build-up to the detriment of the security of other States.21.	In recent weeks the United States has been giving wide publicity to its so-called more flexible stand in the Geneva disarmament negotiations. On 26 September this was referred to from this very rostrum. Ill- informed people might get the impression that the United States position has changed for the better and that it is now up to the Soviet side to respond. But is that really the case? Unfortunately not. The United States still has no intention of renouncing the deployment of its new nuclear missiles in Europe. It continues to propose to negotiate only on the number of Soviet medium-range missiles to be reduced and on the number of United States missiles to be deployed in Europe over and above the nuclear arsenal already possessed by NATO. The United States remains categorically opposed to counting British and French missiles and nuclear-capable aircraft and is reluctant to admit that the Soviet Union is compelled to maintain in its possession an equivalent counterpart of these weapons.22.	Clearly there has been no change in the United States position on these two central issues. What  then  is the meaning of these American pronouncements?23.	First  as we know  Washington claims to possess the right to deploy in Europe as many new United States missiles as the Soviet Union has not only in its European but also in its Asian area. The reply to Washington has been that this is not logical. Now the United States of America is proposing another approach  the entire  novelty  and  flexibility  of which boil down to its promise not to deploy all its missiles in Europe but rather a certain number of them  the rest being deployed  elsewhere   which would nevertheless be close to Soviet territory. Does this really change anything of substance?24.	Secondly  the United States and NATO are known to have plans to deploy 572 medium-range nuclear missilesâ108 Pershing 2 missiles and 464 ground-launched cruise missilesâin Europe. Now the United States has declared that if the Soviet side were to agree  for example  to the deployment of 450 rather than 572 United States missiles in Europe and in other areas adjacent to the Soviet Union and to an equivalent reduction of its own missiles  the United States would consider the question of mixing those two types of United States missiles to be deployed. It is obvious that there is nothing new here either  just vague formulas. What is in fact being proposed is that the Soviet Union should reduce missiles while the United States is to deploy them.25.	Thirdly  the United States has expressed its willingness to consider the inclusion  in an agreement on the limitation of nuclear weapons in Europe  of nuclear- capacity aircraft of medium range  with the following reservations: that the Soviet Union would agree to the deployment of new United States missiles in Europe and elsewhere; and that the agreement should cover all types of Soviet aircraft of medium range while leaving out hundreds of United States aircraft of equivalent range that are either stationed in Western Europe or based on aircraft carriers close to its shores  as well as all aircraft systems of the NATO allies of the United States. Here is another transparent attempt to project a false image of a change in the United States position. In fact  however  nothing new  no constructive spirit or true flexibility has emerged. This is a propaganda manoeuvre designed to mislead public opinion and make it easier to go ahead with the missile deployment plan.26.	The same kind of misleading manoeuvring is being used by the United States with regard to the limitation and reduction of strategic arms. The modernization and build-up of qualitatively new strategic nuclear weapons systems  and the ensuring of a unilateral advantage for the United States in this category of weapons too  is cynically portrayed as a genuine contribution to the reduction of nuclear arsenals.27.	If genuine progress is to be achieved in the negotiations  a different approach must be adopted  one which would ensure mutually acceptable solutions which would not prejudice the legitimate interests of any party. What is needed is the political will to reach a just and honest agreement which would result in the effective reduction of the level of nuclear confrontation in strict accordance with the principle of equality and equal security. It is precisely that kind of approach that the Soviet Union has been following in the Geneva negotiations.28.	Efforts are also needed in other areas. One of those areas would be the cessation and prohibition of all nuclear-weapon tests by all States. To achieve progress in this important area the Soviet Union submitted the basic provisions of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests at the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly  and proposed that for the duration of the negotiations a moratorium be declared on tests of all nuclear weapons and of new kinds and types of nuclear-weapon delivery vehicles. Naturally  progress in this field  too  is contingent on the willingness of all the nuclear Powers to show common sense and a constructive approach and to recognize their responsibility for the fate of mankind. A complete and general ban on nuclear-weapon tests would be of considerable help in preventing the possibility of developing new kinds of such weapons and in consolidating the non-proliferation regime.29.	The goal of preventing further dangerous developments in the world and a drift towards disaster is also being pursued through other specific Soviet proposals concerning arms limitation; proposals which if implemented would in our opinion be conducive to the creation of a favourable atmosphere for measures of a more radical nature. Such measures would include  in particular  the actual working out by the Committee on Disarmament of a convention on the prohibition of the production  stockpiling  deployment and use of neutron weapons  and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions of the world  including the European continent. The strengthening of the security of non-nuclear States  too  is quite important.30.	The solution to the problem of the earliest possible banning of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weaponsâone of the most barbaric means of annihilating peopleâhas been long overdue. The draft basic provisions of a convention on this subject put forward by the Soviet Union provide a constructive platform for banning these weapons. It provides for the total cessation of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons  a gradual destruction of stockpiles and the elimination of manufacturing facilities. This draft is before the Committee on Disarmament.  The General Assembly has repeatedly indicated its strong support for an agreement on the comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapon. Any further delay in solving the problem of the prohibition of chemical weapons carries with it not only a threat that the stockpiles of these weapons will increase but also the threat that more countries will acquire them. It is clear that the Committee should begin as soon as possible the actual business of negotiating the text of such a convention. The socialist countries  which have been consistently advocating the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons on a global scale  have expressed their agreement and called upon other States to take parallel steps leading to the attainment of this goal within the European continent. This is precisely the goal pursued in the proposal contained in the Prague Political Declaration concerning the freeing of Europe from chemical weapons.31.	The task of limiting conventional armaments and armed forces has remained as relevant as ever. The socialist countries have put forward a series of constructive proposals aimed at breaking the deadlock in the current Vienna talks on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. We believe that this is a realistic programme of practical action designed to establish equal collective force ceilings at a lower level.32.	We note with satisfaction that December 1983 will see the entry into force of the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed To Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects. The Ukrainian SSR was among the first to ratify this important international agreement. We are confident that the early universalization of the Convention would contribute to the attainment of wider and more significant objectives in the Held of conventional arms limitation and reduction.33.	The Middle East problem has been on the agenda of the General Assembly for over 30 years now. A host of resolutions and decisions have been adopted  yet the situation still remains extremely tense and dangerous. Its root cause lies in the expansionist and aggressive policy of Israel  which enjoys comprehensive United States support and patronage. It is for precisely this reason that for decades the region has been a hotbed of constant military conflicts which are seriously aggravating the entire international situation. The situation in the Middle East has again sharply deteriorated as a result of the brutal United States interference  involving the use of military force  in the internal affairs of Lebanon. This armed intervention by the United States must be stopped and Israel must withdraw from Lebanon without any conditions that would infringe the independence and sovereignty of that country.34.	The situation of conflict in the Middle East can and must be settled not by military confrontation but by peaceful political means at the negotiating table  with due regard for the legitimate rights and just interests of all the States and peoples of the region  including the long- suffering Arab people of Palestine. The Ukrainian SSR reaffirms its unswerving solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people for national independence  and believes that the realization of the legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine and the liberation of all the Arab lands occupied by Israel since 1967 would create favourable conditions for just and lasting peace in the Middle East and for the security of all the States and peoples of the region.35.	Lasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved through the collective efforts of all the parties concerned  with the mandatory participation  on an equal footing  of the Palestine Liberation Organization [ALO]  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. This is precisely the objective of the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an international conference on the Middle East.36.	The world public is gravely concerned about the exacerbation of the situation in Central America  where the United States has launched a campaign of military threats and brutal pressure against sovereign States and national liberation movements that it finds objectionable  and where it is trying to keep anti-people puppet regimes in power and carrying out military intervention against Nicaragua.37.	The Ukrainian SSR is strongly opposed to United States interference in the sovereign affairs of the States of Central America. We are sympathetic to the efforts of the Contadora Group to bring about political settlement in that region. The discussion at the thirty-eighth session of an item proposed by Nicaragua on the situation in Central America [/1/.W242] should contribute to such a settlement.38.	Among the efforts being made in the United Nations in the interest of peace  high priority undoubtedly belongs to actions designed to eliminate the vestiges of colonialism  racism and apartheid. The United Nations has done a great deal in this respect  as is clearly evidenced by the successes in implementing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. However  vestiges of colonialism still persist  and they constitute a source of international crises and conflicts. This is vividly demonstrated by Britain's desire to maintain its colonial domination over the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands.39.	The situation prevailing in southern Africa gives the world cause for profound concern. The Ukrainian SSR strongly supports the demand of the overwhelming majority of States that the Security Council impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa  in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Only concerted efforts by all States and total international isolation and boycott can force the racists to end the abominable practice of apartheid to halt their aggression against neighbouring independent African Statesâprimarily Angolaâand to grant independence to Namibia.40.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR draws attention to the mounting tension in the Korean peninsula. We consider it our duty to express our solidarity with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its struggle for the democratic reunification of the country  without outside interference  and for the withdrawal of United States forces from South Korea.41.	The implementation of a proposal by the Mongolian People's Republic to conclude a convention on mutual non-aggression and non-use of force in relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific would make a significant contribution to the strengthening of confidence  understanding and good-neighbourliness between Asian States.42.	We are strongly opposed to attempts by the representatives of some States to involve this session in a discussion of the so-called Afghan question  which could only impede efforts to achieve a settlement of the situation around Afghanistan. The proposals put forward by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan constitute a good basis for such a settlement.43.	The General Assembly has been forced to discuss the so-called Kampuchean question  against the will of the Kampuchean people and its Government. We support the proposals in the documents of the conference of the leaders of Viet Nam  Laos  and the People's Republic of Kampuchea for normalizing the situation in Southeast Asia. The countries of Indo-China have reaffirmed their desire to develop a dialogue with the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and to establish a zone of peace  stability and co-operation in the region. These proposals provide a genuine basis for improving the political climate in South-East Asia and throughout the world.44.	The solution of global problems  such as those of the provision of enough food for all the people on earth  supplies of energy resources to rapidly developing industry  protection of the environment  control of dangerous diseases  and management of the resources of the world oceans  calls for extensive and stable international cooperation. These problems undoubtedly include the elimination of the underdevelopment  inherited from the colonial era  of many States of Asia  Africa and Latin America.45.	We cannot fail to see that the deterioration of the international situation seriously affects prospects for the economic growth of the developing nations and impedes the struggle to establish a new international economic order. That is why we believe that to struggle to consolidate peace and security and to end the arms race is the sacred duty of every State and every Government striving for the economic and social progress of its people.46.	Numerous initiatives by the socialist countries are aimed at utilizing the vast economic potentials inherent in disarmament. One of these important initiatives is the appeal to the NATO countriesâmade on 28 June this yearâto start negotiations immediately on ceasing to increase and subsequently mutually reducing military expenditures  so that the funds thus released may be used for economic and social development  including that of the developing nations [see	This initiative reflects our understanding of the intrinsic interdependence of peace  disarmament and development. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR will be guided by this approach with regard to the entire range of problems of development and international economic co-operation before the current session. We shall play our part in making its decisions adequately reflect the desire of the peoples of the world for active peaceful coexistence and for the development of mutually beneficial ties  in peace and stability.47.	The Ukrainian people is engaged in peaceful creative work to carry out the plans for social  economic and cultural development for the years 1981-1985 formulated by the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the twenty-sixth Congress of the Communist Party of the Ukraine. We must have peace if these plans are to be implemented. Mr. Vladimir Shcherbitsky  Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine  has pointed out that the peaceful nature of our policy is not merely a matter of words  showmanship or reliance on temporary advantages in international affairs . . .Its peaceful nature stems from the very essence of our socialist system. 48.	Together with other States Members of the United Nations  the Ukrainian SSR is ready to continue to make every effort to preserve peace  prevent nuclear catastrophe  curb the arms race and create a climate of understanding and co-operation between the peoples on our planet.

"138",7187,"URY",38,1983,"ï»¿149.	 Mr. President  first of all I should like to express our satisfaction at seeing you preside over the work of the thirty-eighth session. We are quite certain that with your experience and vast knowledge of the Organization you will wisely and skilfully discharge your functions.150.	We also wish to thank your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  for his work in the last session.151.	We also welcome Saint Christopher and Nevis as a new member of the Organization. It is a country also belonging to the family of Latin American nations.152.	Before beginning my address  I should like to express our sympathy to the victims of the attack against government officials of the Republic of Korea. We extend our condolences to them. This deed demonstrates the state of violence in the world and deserves the most emphatic condemnation.153.	Uruguay comes to this session of the General Assembly to renew its commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. The efforts made by the Organization and the activities of the various organs of the system to attain faithfully all their noble goals  therefore  merit our firm support.154.	We must observe  unfortunately  that many centers of conflict and political tension persist and contribute  in one fashion or another  to keeping the world in an unstable and dangerous state of affairs. Given this uncertain situation in which the peace and security of mankind are at stake  we cannot permit procrastination or omissions  for the United Nations has a vital role to play to prevent conflicts and to contribute to the peaceful solution of disputes.155.	Today  more than ever before  we must do our utmost to attain peace  through the full implementation of the principles of international law.156.	Our country is deeply committed to this goal and has reiterated our steadfast confidence in the peaceful settlement of disputes  in moderation and in constructive dialogue  inspired by respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.157.	We have come to the Assembly deeply disturbed at the extremely difficult times that mankind is going through  a time of deep crisis in supreme spiritual values  a time of economic crisis  of distrust and lack of understanding between States  bringing in their train difficulties and confrontations which affect international relations more every day and endanger peaceful coexistence between nationsâthe supreme purpose of the Organization.158.	It is vital  therefore  for each Government and each representative to help produce the political will necessary to resolve the serious questions with which we are concerned. I shall deal next with the main factors of those questions  for it is only through political will that we are able to meet the just aspirations of our peoples.159.	In this connection  we must emphasize  in the first place  the grave situation of the international economy. This situation has a world-wide impact  but it has the most serious effect on the developing countriesânot merely because of the temporary difficulties  however grave they may be  but because our countries seem to be immersed in a protracted crisis in which various factors work together to hamper our possibilities. I am referring in particular to external debt servicing  to the protectionism practiced by the industrialized countries  to the fall in the prices of export commodities and to the drastic reduction in development financing  both public and private  as well as to the high interest rates in the international financial market.160.	In that context  it is hard to imagine how some countries can find the resources to finance new projects and to modernize our industries  when there is a reduction in the flow of investments and when our exports cannot be placed in the protected markets of the developed world  at the same time that our financial obligations are increasing.161.	In describing the present situationâleaving aside exercises in economic abstractions or in the performance of variables in mathematical modelsâwe must bear in mind the very serious social and human condition  inseparable from the crisis which affects us all.162.	That is the harsh reality besetting us; it calls for solutions and answers. That is why the understandable frustration at sterile efforts must be replaced by a renewed impetus to seek solutions within the international community.163.	The more than limited results of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should be grounds for deep reflection. There can be no doubt but that all countries  developed and developing  have a sovereign right to direct and administer their economies and to foster their progress as each sees fit. But it is also clear that the developed countries  given their weight and impact  have a primary responsibility in the present situation and in the possibilities to correct it.164.	These circumstances should not lead  however  to confrontation or a dialectical showdown  since we know that in an interdependent world we all need each other  but it is essential that we test out together new paths in order to explore new prospects for real and effective cooperation.165.	The search for new paths must be carried out urgently  with sharp imagination and full awareness of the responsibility of the present grave crisis  the solution of which  in terms of trade and in more dramatic terms of external debt financing  makes a real commitment absolutely vital.166.	The industrialized countries can no longer ignore the evidence that their own well-being and prosperity as well as their prospects for progress and peaceful development are indissolubly linked to the purchasing power of the developing countries. Therefore  the international community  in particular the developed countries  must bear in mind that the progressive and accelerating financial and economic strangulation of the developing countries that we are now witnessing will without any doubt sweep along the industrialized countries  whose standards of living and  consequently  political and social stability will inevitably be affected  placing the world in a situation of generalized chaos. Should that happen  there will be no solution in time to prevent suffering by all the peoples of the world.167.	The past 40 years have provided a wealth of evidence that armed conflicts have ceased to be the exclusive province of the nations with real might in terms of armaments. Development has ceased to be a guarantee of peace; it cannot be unless it is universalized. Hence  an enormous responsibility will be borne by those who  able to contribute to eliminating differences  instead increase them. Similarly  there will be inevitable consequences for all who take irresponsibly protectionist stands  believing that by generating greater wealth for themselves they will promote in others the meekness and resignation of poverty.168.	In that connection  Uruguay wishes once again to emphasize two matters that are closely linked and that are of the greatest significance. I have in mind the production and marketing of foodstuffs  on the one hand  and malnutrition and hunger  on the other.169.	It is clear that until restrictions and disparities in the marketing of agricultural products and foodstuffs are eliminated  the productive capacity of the developing countries will be limited  with tragic consequences in regard to food supply.169 My country hopes that this crucial matter  affecting the larger part of mankind  will be tackled with determination. In this connection  we firmly call for the elimination of protectionist mechanisms and export subsidies used by the industrialized countries.170.	It is obvious that it is the nations with the greatest possibilities and economic power that  using various means and mechanisms  are currently practicing the greatest protectionism and providing the largest subsidies for their exports. To the extent that this situation persists  there will be an ever-increasing gap between the rich and the poor countries  with the inevitable consequence of internal conflicts with international implications.171.	Unless the developed world plays a real  positive role in this respect  prospects for the growth of the other countries will be non-existent in real terms and the world economy will continue to go through crisis and confrontation.172.	The difficulties facing the developing countries in financing their external indebtedness are notorious. If in the final analysis the only real way to meet cur financial obligations is through exporting our products  the urgency of the present circumstances requires the adoption of special  imaginative solutions in keeping with the gravity of the situation. Among these could be an increase in special drawing rights  the renegotiation of external debt with favourable rates of interest and repayment terms and the necessary co-operation by financial organizations  public and private  operating in the international sphere.173.	Progress in those areas could make possible new breakthroughs in other areas  within the context of a constructive global dialogue  in tune with the reality of a world economy that is becoming increasingly interdependent and integrated. In this connection  my country supports the efforts to launch the global negotiations in which the elimination of barriers to trade in foodstuffs will necessarily have to be faced.174.	Multilateral co-operation for development within the framework of the United Nations is of course not immune to the difficulties besetting the international economy. Nevertheless  the agreement reached on the institutional aspects of science and technology for development shows that progress can be made if we work with good will to preserve and perfect the multilateral instruments for co-operation that have been created through so much effort.175.	Against the background of the serious international economic situation the increase in nuclear and highly sophisticated conventional weapons looms menacingly. It is clear that this phenomenon  negative from the economic and security angle  cannot be disassociated from the existing international tensions and conflicts. It is wishful thinking to imagine really effective disarmament if that is not preceded and accompanied by measures to re-establish confidence and to create an atmosphere of dialogue and understanding.T76. In this context  direct negotiations between the parties should lead to gradual  mutual and verifiable disarmament with the necessary guarantees.177.	Uruguay firmly supports United Nations efforts for disarmament  especially the efforts directed towards a comprehensive programme.178.	Likewise  the creation of denuclearized zones  following the example set for Latin America by the Treaty of Tlatelolco would be a positive and practical step worthy of our every encouragement.179.	As I said at the beginning of the statement  Uruguay is completely at one with the need to mobilize the political will required to reach real solutions. If we believe we will attain such results by simply talking  if every period of tranquillity is interpreted as weakness that can be exploited to pursue a destabilizing armaments policy  we shall not be able to translate into reality the demands of our peoples. That can be attained only with the clear and uniform conviction that peace is the essential and supreme good. Inevitably  all efforts must be aimed at reaching this inescapable goal  leaving aside rhetoric and dialectics.180.	The question of the Malvinas Islands occupies a significant place among the matters deserving the attention of the international community. My country has taken a clear and well-defined position on the substance of the question  the legitimate rights of the Argentine Republic to sovereignty over the islands.181.	Twenty years ago  the Uruguayan delegation stated the need for a negotiated solution. Today we reiterate that position based on international law. It is therefore necessary  as we requested at the thirty-seventh session and as was approved by an overwhelming majority  that this dispute be placed firmly in the framework of negotiations within the United Nations and with the participation of the Secretary-General.182.	It is necessary to avoid military preparations and to set aside all the factors which could provoke confrontation. Uruguay once again reiterates its fervent appeal for a search for peaceful and worthy solutions and again expresses its readiness to co-operate with other nations to this end. The United Nations can and must play a proper role in the creation of a legal and political framework that will make such solutions possible.183.	My country  as a member of the family of Latin American nations    particularly affected by the scale of suffering afflicting many human beings because of the persistence of violence in Central America. 184.	Security Council resolution 530 (1983)  which was adopted unanimously  traced a path for resolving the tragic crisis situation in that region. In that legal and political framework  Uruguay firmly supports the efforts of the Contadora Group to find satisfactory solutions. Of particular importance are the basic principles set forth by the Group to that effect  which are in keeping with international law. It is to be hoped that this work will continue  reaching a stage of practicalities in order to consolidate peace  which is the goal of our collective efforts.185.	My country is always prepared to co-operate constructively at both the regional and international world levels to attain this goal  to rescue Central America from global tensions and conflicts and from outside interference.186.	We should also note that  unfortunately  no progress has been made in the Middle East situation. The valuable peace initiatives taken in 1982 and the encouraging talks held in 1983 by various parties have not produced tangible results  and there now seems to be general uncertainty as to the future.187.	However  it is useful to recall in this connection that was the United Nations which managed to produce a set of solution-oriented principles  and those principles are still fully valid.188.	We therefore believe that any solution must take into account  inter alia the following considerations.189.	A negotiated solution is needed which will provide for the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to exist within secure and internationally recognized frontiers  with justice and security for all peoples. It must at the same time ensure recognition and exercise of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establish their own form of political organization. Also  the time factor is of essential importance in attaining a just and equitable solution.190.	Hence  as  we stated at the thirty-seventh session  our country  will firmly support any action designed to bring about peace in the Middle East. ... It should be brought about through agreements negotiated among the parties involved without violence and with justice . . . in accordance e with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.  191.. The situation in Lebanon is deeply disturbing. Uruguay  which has close ties with that country for so many reasons  would like to take this opportunity to reiterate its firm support for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and self-determination of Lebanon. The authority of its Government must be consolidated and extended throughout the territory. Foreign armed forces  whether of a regular or irregular character  must be all withdrawn  except for those which the Lebanese Government freely requests to remain  and for the period specified. We trust that the United Nations  in co-operation with the Lebanese Government  will be able to play an active role in the vast political  social and humanitarian enterprise ahead.192. The Security Council has dealt with the question of Namibia on many occasions. The General Assembly  for its part  has supplemented those decisions with solid support for Namibian independence. It is therefore very regrettable that there is still no sign of Teal progress in implementing the decisions of the United Nations. There can be no doubt that the occupation of Namibia should cease as soon as possible and that  under an interim United Nations administration  the people of Namibia must freely choose its own future and build up its own political organization.193.	Similarly  United Nations bodies and the international community have repeatedly condemnedand called for an end to it.194.	Uruguay most strongly opposes the apartheid regime and all forms of racism and discrimination.is basically contrary to the philosophy and institutions of the Uruguayan people  in addition to being a violation of international norms.195.	This unvarying position of my country is reflected in its being a party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  and in the fact that we were the first State to accept the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to receive individual complaints.196.	The Uruguayan delegation is ready to co-operate with other like-minded delegations in the search for international means  in accordance with the Charter  of bringing about the speediest compliance with resolutions relating to these questions adopted by the Organization.197.	In this context we should emphasize the importance we attach to the attainment of a peaceful solution to the question of the unification of Korea  arrived at independently through direct negotiations and dialogue between the two Koreas. This could help establish lasting peace in the area  based on mutual understanding.198.	We sincerely hope that the international community will make a positive contribution to the resolution of this problem. In this connection  we support the activities of the Secretary-General  including the use of his good offices to bring about the resumption of the essential dialogue between South Korea and North Korea.199.	The magnitude of the outstanding questions and the limited progress that has been made  not to mention the outright setbacks  undoubtedly give rise to feelings of frustration. However  we should not become discouraged.200.	Despite the difficulties  the United Nations continues to provide an irreplaceable forum for world dialogue. It is the most important centre for organizing multilateral co-operation  and within its framework there are important contacts and negotiations that should be encouraged. The reasons that gave life to the Organization and the goals set for it continue to be essential for the peoples of the United Nations: namely  preserving peace and promoting economic and social progress.201.	That is why Uruguay firmly supports the plan put forward by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization to the previous session and the new approaches in this year's report	We also welcome the valuable considerations and suggestions put forward by other countries.202.	Uruguay has transmitted to the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization some comments intended essentially to suggest procedural means for more expeditious action by the Security Council in critical situations and to support the full development of the powers of the Secretary-General  whose role should be enhanced with the whole-hearted support of the Member States.203.	I emphasize that my country fully shares the view that has evolved about the need to strengthen the Organization and to make it more effective. This trend should be continued and deepened. My delegation will co-operate at all times with the efforts to attain that goal. 204.	The efforts to rationalize the Organization's budget and expenditures without at the same time paralyzing programmes of real benefit to our peoples are worth mentioning as a major practical consideration. They imply consideration of co-ordination with the other bodies and agencies within the system.205.	Before concluding  I should like to make some brief comments about the situation in my country. These remarks are to give the international community some information and are not intended as any kind of justification. My country obviously could not escape the grave difficulties arising from the international recession.206.	Faced with this crisis  the Government took the measures which it deemed the most appropriate to deal with the present situation with the means at our disposal  despite protectionist barriers and other adverse factors to which I referred when speaking about the international economy.207.	We are convinced that we have been doing everything possible  and we have made progress during these very difficult times. We have had to make sacrifices and do without certain things  but we have done so with confidence and faith in the future.208.	At the same time  now that the scourges that devastated our country in the past  with a violence incompatible with the naturally peaceful spirit of our people  have been neutralized  Uruguay is advancing firmly and with determination along the path back to true democracy  in keeping with the feelings of the Uruguayanpeople and Government.209.	Despite temporary procedural difficulties  the Government has prepared  and is keeping to  an institutional schedule  some important stages of which have already been completed  such as the reorganization of political parties and the election of their officers by popular vote. The schedule  recently reaffirmed  provides for the holding of general elections in November 1984 and the transfer of power in March 1985 to those elected.210.	This is the path on which the Government has embarked with unswerving determination  a path that leads  with peace and moderation  towards the institutionalisation of full democracy  in keeping with our secular  civic traditions and with the consent and understanding of the Uruguayan people.211.	The Government will maintain its firm determined and genuine commitment to institutionalize the country.212.	In concluding by offering a summary of the international situation  I must recognize  realistically  the existence of divergences  divisions and even outright conflicts within the international community. This situation is often the reason for lack of action by United Nations organs.213.	In this respect  as I said at the beginning of my statement  no real progress will be possible without the political will and collective determination of Member States to act in all matters in accordance with the Charter.214.	We must make a renewed commitment to work together in common endeavours  acting with full respect for the sovereign right of each State to direct its own destiny without outside interference  without attempts by some to exercise hegemony over others and without patronizing lessons which would be as unacceptable as they would be inappropriate.215.	It is necessary to speak frankly and sincerely. It is imperative to maintain an open dialogue and to work in a constructive spirit. It is essential to reaffirm our faith in law and in the United Nations. It is essential to make a supreme effort with courage and dedication to continue our progress  overcoming scepticism and current difficulties.216.	Only thus shall we meet the crucial challenge of the hour and fulfil the mandate of our peoples  building a future of peace and happiness for all mankind."
"139",7234,"USA",38,1983,"ï»¿1.	Thank you for granting me the honor of speaking today  on this first day of the general debate at the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Once again I come before this body preoccupied with peace. Last year I stood in this chamber to address the special session on disarmament. I have come today to renew my nation's commitment to peace. I have come to discuss how we can keep faith with the dreams that created this Organization.2.	The United Nations was founded in the aftermath of the Second World War to protect future generations from the scourge of war  to promote political self- determination and global prosperity  and to strengthen the bonds of civility among nations. The founders sought to replace a world at war with a world of civilized order. They hoped that a world of relentless conflict would give way to a new era  one where freedom from violence prevailed.3.	Whatever challenges the world was bound to face  the founders intended this body to stand for certain values  even if they could not be enforced  and to condemn violence  even if it could not be stopped. This body was to speak with the voice of moral authority. That was to be its greatest power.4.	But the awful truth is that the use of violence for political gain has become more  not less  widespread in the last decade. Events of recent weeks have presented new  unwelcome evidence of brutal disregard for life and truth. They have offered unwanted testimony on how divided and dangerous our world is  how quick the recourse to violence.5.	What has happened to the dreams of the founders of the United Nations?6.	What has happened to the spirit which created the United Nations?7.	The answer is clear: Governments got in the way of the dreams of the people. Dreams became issues of East versus West. Hopes became political rhetoric. Progress became a search for power and domination. Somewhere the truth was lost that people do not make war  governments do.8.	And today  in Asia  Africa  Latin America  the Middle East and the North Pacific  the weapons of war shatter the security of the peoples who live there  endanger the peace of neighbors  and create ever more arenas of confrontation between the great Powers. During the past year alone  violent conflicts have occurred in the hills around Beirut  the deserts of Chad and the Western Sahara  in the mountains of El Salvador  the streets of Suriname  the cities and countryside of Afghanistan  the borders of Kampuchea  and the battlefields of Iran and Iraq.9.	We cannot count on the instinct for survival to protect us against war. Despite all the wasted lives and hopes that war produces  it has remained a regular  if horribly costly  means by which nations have sought to settle their disputes or advance their goals.10.	And the progress in weapons technology has far outstripped the progress toward peace. In modern times  a new  more terrifying element has entered into the calculationsânuclear weapons. A nuclear war cannot be won and it must never be fought. I believe that if governments are determined to deter and prevent war  there will not be war. Nothing is more in keeping with the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations than arms control.11.	When I spoke before the twelfth special session  devoted to disarmament. I affirmed the United States Government's commitment  and my personal commitment  to reduce nuclear arms  and to negotiate in good faith toward that end.12.	Today  I reaffirm those commitments. The United States has already reduced the number of its nuclear weapons worldwide and  while replacement of older weapons is unavoidable  we wish to negotiate arms reduction; and to achieve significant  equitable  verifiable arms control agreements. And let me add  we must ensure that world security is not undermined by the further spread of nuclear weapons. Nuclear non-proliferation must not be the forgotten element of the world's arms control agenda13.	At my last visit here  I expressed hope that a whole class of weapons systemsâthe longer-range intermediate nuclear forcesâcould be banned from the face of the earth. I believe that to relieve the deep concern of peoples in both Europe and Asia  the time was right  for the first time in history  to resolve a security threat exclusively through arms control. I still believe the elimination of these weaponsâthe zero optionâis the best  fairest  most practical solution to the problem. Unfortunately  the Soviet Union declined to accept the total elimination of this class of weapons.14.	When I was here last  I hoped that the critical Strategic Arms Reduction Talks would focus  and urgently so  on those systems that carry the greatest risk of nuclear warâthe fast-flying  accurate  intercontinental ballistic missiles which pose a first strike potential. I also hoped the negotiations could reduce by one half the number of strategic missiles on each side and reduce their warheads by one third. Again  I was disappointed when the Soviets declined to consider such deep cuts  and refused as well to concentrate on these most dangerous destabilizing weapons.15.	Despite the rebuffs  the United States has not abandoned and will not abandon the search for meaningful arms control agreements. Last June  I proposed a new approach toward the START negotiations. We did not alter our objective of substantial reductions  but we recognized that there are a variety of ways to achieve this end. During the last round of Geneva talks  we presented a draft treaty which responded to a number of concerns raised by the Soviet Union. We will continue to build upon this initiative.16.	Similarly  in our negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces  when the Soviet leaders adamantly refused to consider the total elimination of these weapons  the United States made a new offer. We proposed  as an interim solution  some equal number on both sides between one and 572. We recommended the lowest possible level. Once again  the Soviets refused an equitable solution and proposed instead what might be called a ""half zero option""âzero for us  and many hundreds of warheads for them. That is where things stand today  but I still have not given up hope that the Soviet Union will enter into serious negotiations.17.	We are determined to spare no effort to achieve a sound  equitable and verifiable agreement. For this reason  I have given new instructions to Mr. Nitze at Geneva  telling him to put forward a package of steps designed to advance the negotiations as rapidly as possible. These initiatives build on the interim framework that the United States advanced last March and address concerns that the Soviets have raised at the bargaining table in the past.18.	Specifically  first  the United States proposes a new initiative on global limits. If the Soviet Union agrees to reductions and limits on a global basis  the United States for its part will not offset the entire Soviet global missile deployment through United States deployments in Europe. We would  of course  retain the right to deploy missiles elsewhere.19.	Second  the United States is prepared to be more flexible on the content of the current talks. The United States will consider mutually acceptable ways to address the Soviet desire that an agreement should limit aircraft as well as missiles 20.	Third  the United States will address the mix of missiles that would result from reductions. In the context of reductions to equal levels  we are prepared to reduce the number of Pershing II ballistic missiles as well as ground-launched cruise missiles.21.	I have decided to put forward these important initiatives after full and extensive consultations with our allies  including personal correspondence that I have had with the leaders of the Governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Japan and frequent meetings of the NATO Special Consultative Group. I have also stayed in close touch with other concerned friends and allies. The door to an agreement is open. It is time for the Soviet Union to walk through it.22.	I want to make an unequivocal pledge to those gathered today in this world arena. The United States seeks and will accept any equitable  verifiable agreement that stabilizes forces at lower levels than currently exist. We are ready to be flexible in our approachâindeed  willing to compromise. We cannot  however  especially in light of recent events  compromise on the necessity of effective verification.23.	Reactions to the Korean airliner tragedy are a timely reminder of just how different the Soviets' concept of truth and international co-operation is from that of the rest of the world. Evidence abounds that we cannot simply assume that agreements negotiated with the Soviet Union will be fulfilled. We negotiated the Helsinki Final Act ' but the promised freedoms have not been provided and those in the Soviet Union who sought to monitor their fulfillment languish in prison. We negotiated a biological weapons convention  but deadly yellow rain and other toxic agents fall on Hmong villages and Afghan encampments. We have negotiated arms agreements  but the high level of Soviet encoding hides the information needed for their verification. A newly discovered radar facility and a new inter-continental ballistic missile raise serious concerns about Soviet compliance with agreements already negotiated.24.	Peace cannot be served by pseudo-control of arms. We need reliable  reciprocal reductions. I call upon the Soviet Union today to reduce the tensions it has heaped on the world in the past few weeks and to show a firm commitment to peace by coming to the bargaining table with a new understanding of its obligations. I urge it to match our flexibility. If the Soviets sit down at the bargaining table seeking genuine arms reductions  there will be arms reductions. The Governments of the West and their peoples will not be diverted by misinformation and threats. The time has come for the Soviet Union to show proof that it wants arms control in reality  not just in rhetoric.25.	Meaningful arms control agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union would make our world less dangerous; so would a number of confidence- building steps that we have already proposed to the Soviet Union.26.	Arms control requires a spirit beyond narrow national interests. This spirit is a basic pillar on which the United Nations was founded. We seek a return to this spirit. A fundamental step would be a true non-alignment of the United Nations. This would signal a return to the true values of the Charter  including the principle of universality. The Members of the United Nations must be aligned on the side of justice  rather than injustice; peace  rather than aggression; human dignity  rather than subjugation. Any other alignment is beneath the purpose of this great body and destructive of the harmony that it seeks. What harms the Charter harms peace.27.	The founders of the United Nations expected that Member nations would behave and vote as individuals  after they had weighed the merits of an issueârather like a great  global town meeting. The emergence of blocs and the polarization of the United Nations undermine all that the Organization initially valued.28.	We must remember that the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries was founded to counter the development of blocs and to promote cooperation between them. Its founders spoke of the right of smaller countries not to become involved in others' disagreements. Since then  membership in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has grown dramatically  but not all the new members have shared the founders' commitment of genuine non- alignment. Indeed  client Governments of the Soviet Union which have long since lost their independence have flocked into the Movement and once inside have worked against its true purpose. Pseudo non-alignment is no better than pseudo-control of arms.29.	The United States rejects as false and misleading the view of the world as divided between the empires of the East and the West. We reject it on factual grounds. The United States does not head any bloc of subservient nations  nor do we desire to. What is called ""the West"" is a free alliance of Governments  most of which are democratic and all of which greatly value their independence. What is called ""the East"" is an empire directed from the center  which is Moscow. 30.	The United States today  as in the past  is a champion of freedom and self-determination for all peoples. We welcome diversity; we support the right of all nations to define and pursue their national goals. We respect their decisions and their sovereignty  asking only that they respect the decisions and sovereignty of others. Just look at the world over the last 30 years and then decide for yourselves whether the United States or the Soviet Union has pursued an expansionist policy.31.	Today  the United States contributes to peace by supporting collective efforts by the international community. We give our unwavering support to the peacekeeping efforts of this body  as well as to other multilateral peace-keeping efforts around the world. The United Nations has a proud history of promoting conciliation and helping keep the peace. Today  United Nations peace-keeping forces or observers are present in Cyprus  Kashmir  on the Golan Heights and in Lebanon.32.	In addition to our encouragement of international diplomacy  the United States recognizes its responsibilities to use its own influence for peace. From the days when Theodore Roosevelt mediated the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 we have a long and honorable tradition of mediating or dampening conflicts and promoting peaceful solutions. In Lebanon  we  along with France  Italy and the United Kingdom  have worked for a cease-fire  for the withdrawal of all external forces  and for restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity. In Chad  we have joined others in supporting the recognized Government  in the face of external aggression. In Central America  as in southern Africa  we are seeking to discourage reliance upon force and to construct a framework for peaceful negotiations. We support a policy to disengage the major Powers from third-world conflict.33.	The Charter of the United Nations gives an important role to regional organizations in the search for peace. The United States efforts in the cause of peace are only one expression of a spirit that also animates others in the world community. The Organization of American States was a pioneer in regional security efforts. In Central America  the members of the Contadora Group are striving to lay a foundation for peaceful resolution of that region's problems. In East Asia  countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations have built a framework for peaceful political and economic co-operation that has greatly strengthened the prospects for lasting peace in their region. In Africa  organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States are being forged to provide practical structures in the struggle to realize Africa's potential.34.	From the beginning  our hope for the United Nations has been that it would reflect the international community at its best. The United Nations at its best can help us transcend fear and violence and can act as an enormous force for peace and prosperity. Working together  we can combat international lawlessness and promote human dignity.35.	If the Governments represented in this chamber want peace as genuinely as their peoples do  we shall find it. We can do so by reasserting the moral authority of the United Nations.36.	In recent weeks  the moral outrage of the world seems to have reawakened. Out of the billions of people who inhabit this planet  why  some might ask  should the death of several hundred shake the world so profoundly? Why should the death of a mother flying toward a reunion with her family or the death of a scholar heading toward new pursuits of knowledge matter so deeply?Why are nations which lost no citizens in the tragedy so angry?37.	The reason rests on our assumptions about civilized life and the search for peace. The confidence that allows a mother or a scholar to travel to Asia or Africa or Europe or anywhere else on this planet may be only a small victory in humanity's struggle for peace. Yet what is peace if not the sum of such small victories?38.	Each stride for peace and every small victory are important for the journey towards a larger and lasting peace. We have made progress. We have avoided another world war. We have seen an end to the traditional colonial era and the birth of 100 newly sovereign nations. Even though development remains a formidable challenge  we have witnessed remarkable economic growth among the industrialized and the developing nations. The United Nations and its affiliates have made important contributions to the quality of life on this planet  such as directly saving countless lives through its refugee and emergency relief programmes. These broad achievements  however  have been overshadowed by the problems that weigh so heavily upon us. The problems are old  but it is not too late to commit ourselves to a new beginning  a beginning fresh with the ideals of the Charter.39.	Today  at the beginning of this thirty-eighth session  I solemnly pledge my nation to upholding the original ideals of the United Nations. Our goals are those that guide this very body. Our ends are the same as those of the founders of the United Nations  who sought to replace a world at war with one where the rule of law would prevail  where human rights were honored  where development would blossom  where conflict would give way to freedom from violence.40.	In 1956 President Dwight Eisenhower made an observation on weapons and deterrence in a letter to a publisher. He wrote:""When we get to the point  as we one day will  that both sides know that in any outbreak of general hostilities  regardless of the element of surprise  destruction will be both reciprocal and complete  possibly we will have sense enough to meet at the conference table with the understanding that the era of armaments has ended and the human race must conform its actions to this truth or die.""He went on to say "". . .we have already come to the point where safety cannot be assumed by arms alone . . . their usefulness becomes concentrated more and more in their characteristics as deterrents than in instruments with which to obtain victory . . ."".41.	As we persevere in the search for a more secure world we must do everything we can to let diplomacy triumph. Diplomacy  the most honorable of professions  can bring the most blessed of gifts  the gift of peace. If we succeed  the world will find an excitement and accomplishment in peace beyond that which could ever be imagined through violence and war.I want to leave you today with a message I have often spoken about to the citizens of my own country  especially in times when I have felt they were discouraged and unsure. I say it to you with as much hope and heart as I have said it to my own people. You have the right to dream great dreams. You have the right to seek a better world for your people. A11 of us have the responsibility to work for that better world and  as caring peaceful peoples  think what a powerful force for good we could be. Let us regain the dream the United Nations once dreamed."
"140",7306,"VCT",38,1983,"ï»¿126. Mr. President  may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment to this very responsible office in this most important assembly of our international community. Whatever we may be inclined to say from time to time  the United Nations and the General Assembly represent a potential force for world stability and order in a sea of tension and continuing conflicts.127.	I am aware  Mr. President  that because of our ability in this world community to move from conflict to conflict and to debate multiple conflicts which engage our attention and which must be resolved here  your task will become more demanding. I am sure  however  that you will do credit to the Assembly.128.	Might it not be prudent for us here as Members to re-examine the purposes for which the United Nations was established in 1945? Has the time not come when we should examine the manner in which our nations have been endeavouring to promote those aims and objectives? We are none of us without faultsânone of us as nations are paragons of virtue. Yet  what may really be important is the manner in which we accept our responsibility as Members and attempt to be supportive of those aims and objectives which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.129.	The world community is confronted with innumerable problems. To list them in order of priority for corrective action may be difficult  for there may be divergent views concerning this. Some may say that world economic recovery is the number one matter to be addressed since this will correct unemployment and bring about greater social justice. Others may hold the view that the violation of human rightsâwhich are basic to ail mankindâis the first priority. Much can be said for these views. However  the most urgent priority is the achieving of nuclear disarmament. This is a recurrent theme because it is a grave problem. Ws cannot be satisfied today when we consider the tremendous stockpile of existing nuclear weapons. We cannot be satisfied because of the excessive danger which its mere existence poses to all mankind. So long as nuclear weapons exist  there will continue to be unacceptable risks which cannot be eliminated by a guarantee not to initiate the first strike. There is an urgent need for negotiations to contain  control and reduce the spread of nuclear weapons. To reach any agreement there must be the will on all sides to make concessions to achieve the reduction of existing stockpiles and  eventually  to eliminate the possession of nuclear weapons by all nations.130.	Time is running out. It is inevitable that the longer these weapons of mass destruction exist the higher is the probability that an error of judgment may occur  with all its frightening consequences. No man can devise a system that is immune from en r. Can we continue to live in snug complacency in these circumstances? Must we be afraid to offend when to offend may mean the very survival of mankind? In a thermonuclear war there can be no truly safe part of the globe. Not even the most eminent scientists can predict what would be the cumulative effect upon mankind if nations began a senseless  irrational cross-delivery of nuclear missiles  each being fully aware that the other side could not survive that holocaust.131.	To what end and for what purpose are these weapons kept? We are told that the terror of it all has kept this world safer  yet in spite of the terror there are more wars and conflicts on the international scene today than at any other time. There are conflicts in the Middle East  the Far East  Africa  Central America  South America  Northern Ireland  Afghanistan and elsewhere. It is as if war had now become an infectious international plague. Might it not be that that very terror  that false sense of the safety of the nuclear umbrella  gives a free hand for mischief in other  non-nuclear  areas? Because of this perverse sense of logic there is much to be said for the mutual effect that the terror of it all must have.132.	For this reason  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines cannot responsibly advocate unilateral disarmament  which is a flirtation with disaster. Unilateral disarmament is an illogical prescription to cure a very serious and rival- ridden problem  since whichever nation puts itself in that position in this super-Power conflict will put itself at a distinct disadvantage. In such circumstances  whichever country did so would be psychologically weakened  whatever its relative strength in conventional weapons  and could be blackmailed.133.	There must therefore be  instead of unilateral disarmament  a phased reduction and as far as practicable parity must be maintained during such reduction until all weapons are totally eliminated. This type of even balance would be a safeguard and would have a sobering effect on the continuous conflicts in human nature  in which love and hate coexist  in which fear of insecurity and belief in security dwell together  in which national interests and pride override prudence and even the desire for peace.134.	I am convinced that we must collectively  every year  deal with this subject and project our concern in a positive manner in an earnest endeavour to awaken the consciousness of the Assemblyâof all its Membersâto the unreasoning imposition to which the international community  without having any say  is being subjected and over which it has no control.135.	It is patently obvious that each of the super-Powers is in a no-win situation. It is patently obvious  therefore  that there must be some sensible degree of give and take. Both must reach an accommodation and both must show flexibility. It is not fear but reason which demands that.136.	Last year  at the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly [3.2n6f/neef/ng]  I had hoped that the travail of Lebanon would by now be over  but the tension  turmoil  domestic strife and destruction of both life and property are as pervasive now as they were then. A small country is being torn apart not only because of domestic differences  but also because of external interference in the internal affairs of that country  which is a Member of this world body  albeit a small country and a weak one. Lebanon was once  although small  a rich and prosperous country in the Mediterranean with an international banking reputation. Today  this has been ended by strife. Granted that there are different interests to be served and beliefs to be harmonized and harnessed in the national interest  granted that within the society there are deep historic problems based on a concept of power-sharing with respect to the structure and composition of theGovernment  but despite all this  if the people of Lebanon were left and encouraged to resolve their differences through the process of dialogue and not on the Held of battle  if the de facto partition of this small country were brought immediately to an end  and if  instead of arms to kill and destroy being provided  financial assistance were given to rebuild the shattered economy of the country and mend broken family lives  such action would be constructive  would further the peace process and would redound to the credit of all those who have made possible the present cease-fire.137.	I believe we should give credit where it is due  and the Government of Saudi Arabia must be congratulated on the very positive and constructive role which it has played in bringing about a cease-fire through negotiations. The United States and the Syrian Arab Republic have played a very sensitive role in this peace process  notwithstanding that it may be a tenuous peace  just another of the many cease-fires negotiated in Lebanon.138.	Can we not dare to hope that this time  with many elements favourably in place  the cease-fire will hold and that dialogue will now replace the gun in an effort to resolve outstanding differences  that a Government may emerge bearing the stamp of approval of the Lebanese people and the Lebanese people alone  a Government which will direct the future of the country in a climate of peace and stability?139.	Last year the signs were such that an imminent resolution of the Palestinian question seemed within the realm of possibility. It was not to be. Now  a year later  the future of the Palestinians' homeland seems as uncertain as ever. There is more internal division than unity. Notwithstanding this  real peace will come to the Middle East only when the Palestinian Diaspora ends  and that will be only when the people of Palestine have a land to be their home.140.	We cannot be unmindful of the increasing level of violence in Central America. In yet another area of the globe  men have decided not to resolve national problems through discussion and with reasonable good judgment to settle differences without recourse to arms  with the resulting death and destruction involving innocent women and children  most of whom generally desire to lead a peaceful life  that life denied them by the apparently senseless and tragic brutality of their fellow men. Will there be no end to the growing number of homeless and helpless refugees? The refugee problem is ultimately our problem  because we must reflect the conscience and compassion of mankind. Having this responsibility puts on each of us a heavy burden since the existence of refugees from war-tom areas is in itself pros   that we have failed to maintain the momentum for world peace and to strive to achieve the lofty objectives enshrined in the Charter of this inspiring but awesome world body.141.	We are not here because we are dreamers. We are here  I believe  because we are crusaders in the quest for peace  social justice and a balanced international order. Our search for these noble ends must be total and relentless. It is therefore a source of encouragement for my country when we see nations working together to end human suffering  to subdue that inner rage in human nature which sets brothers and sisters at war against each other for causes in which each may believe passionately.142.	Saint Vincent and the Grenadines wishes to applaud the initiative of Mexico  Colombia  Venezuela and Panamaâthe Contadora Groupâin their attempt to find common ground between the warring factions in Central America which will form the basis for discussion to end the strife. There is no easy solution  but talking is the right course since it will help to identify the problems and  by focusing attention on them  may make it possible for solutions to be found. Those that provide the means of destruction are not thereby serving the cause of peace. That cause is better served by a reduction in the flow of arms and by allowing a free expression of the will of the people  without any form of intimidation. Man is by nature a free spirit and nothing should be done to deny or inhibit that freedom. His right to choose and his right to decide are fundamental to the maintenance of that free spirit.143.	On 1 September last a major commercial aviation tragedy befell the world. An aircraft on Korean Air Lines flight 007 was blasted out of the sky by missiles. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines views that incident with shock and horror. We have been compelled to this very critical view by the enormity of the consequences  realizing that 269 innocent persons met their death and how they met it. The position of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is not merely that of joining in a chorus of condemnation  but rather one based on a determination to ensure that such a tragedy never occurs again. There can be no serious consolation with regard to that act for the bereaved families. Despite the right of the Soviet Union to safeguard its territorial integrity  it must be held responsible for the tragedy.144.	It would be a horrible situation if any time a commercial civil aircraft intruded into the national air space of a country  for whatever reason  that country's national security were safeguarded by blasting the offending aircraft out of the sky. It is evident that in this day and age of commercial aviation virtually crowding the sky  due regard should be paid to the type of aircraft being fired at since it may endanger passengers who may in snug satisfaction be unaware that they are doomed. It would be a shocking disregard of the value of human life to act otherwise. Yet such an inexcusable act occurredâan act that is inexcusable whether or not committed in error. The international community must now respond by taking collective action to ensure that this does not happen again. There must be an international convention that establishes a code of procedural conduct to be followed when national air space has been violated. It must be determined immediately  before shots or missiles are fired  what aircraft has violated the national airspace. The convention must establish how the pilot of the offending commercial aircraft must respond to directives and how the pilot of a military aircraft in pursuit must act.145.	There is need for a positive response by all nations in this direction. Whatever may be the reaction to the demand for compensation  international travellers should not be subjected to paying so high a price. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines urges restraint of action where a country's territorial air space has been violated. It is far wiser and more appropriate to retain international respect and goodwill by following safer procedures to compel an offending commercial aircraft to land  thereby gaining an opportunity  through positive proof of spying  not speculation  to expose the wrongful act and as a consequence to elicit greater sympathy and understanding on the part of the international community. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is very concerned since  but for the grace of God  any of us here could have been passengers on that last tragic flight of Korean Air Lines 007. May such a tragedy never  ever occur again.146.	Speaking of tragedy  I wish to put on record publicly here my own dismay and the dismay and horror of my Government at the very tragic incident that occurred just yesterday  Sunday  in Burma  when 15 members of the South Korean Government  including five ministers and one ambassador  were killed while attending a ceremony at the Martyrs' Mausoleum. Part of the troubles afflicting the world community is our insensitivity  our lack of understanding and appreciation of the serious value of human life and a willingness on our part  from time to time and in moments of aberration  to show a wanton disregard of human life. I wish to record my profound sympathy and the sympathy of the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.147.	The problems of southern Africa have continued to occupy the attention of this Assembly for more than 20 years. As those problems cause actions to intensify and positions to harden  we all yearn for a just solution. Hopes have been raised by each initiative towards finding a solution  only to be dashed and destroyed on the South African rock of intransigence and fear. But the solution of these problems  as South Africa should be advised by its friends  depends on justice being done to all Africans âblack and white alike  not just the whites. Namibia must be freed from minority rule and control  thereby putting an end to the repressive measures that seek to deny the legitimacy of the majority will.148.	South Africa  within its own borders  must begin to acknowledge the legitimate rights of blacks and accept the principle that in any system all men are entitled to an equal status in society  be it political  legal  administrative or economic  and that the whites must share power with the blacks on a basis of equality  with the entitlement of all to full rights and privileges. I appreciate that there are matters of serious concern to the South African Government when it comes to the question of the role to be played by whites in a South Africa of equal rights. But any action without acceptance of the fact that justice must be for all will only intensify conflict  not diminish it  in a South Africa of bigotry and hatred that postulates racist supremacy.149.	I am therefore encouraged by the limited movement achieved by the Secretary-General in his recent discussions with the South African Government with regard to Namibia. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is aware that the path forward is difficult and strewn with pitfalls  but we believe that the patience and diligence of the Secretary-General may lead the way to a successful conclusion.150.	The root cause of most of the world's problems is centered either on racial or on religious bigotry  on national expansionist ambitions or on the undue weakness of a country proximate to another if it is perceived that the one could pose a security danger to the other.151.	Racial and religious intolerance within the borders of a country is self-defeating when it comes to the national purpose of unity  and strength through unity. It is inappropriate for nationals of a country to be divided on grounds of race  but it is incomprehensible for people of an ethnic group or any other group to be divided and persecuted on the grounds of their religious beliefs. To impose restraints on people because of their belief is an attempt to muzzle thought. Persecution has never in the history of mankind been able to eliminate religious belief. It not only generates  not unnaturally  tear and caution  but also strengthens faith and attracts adherents. The Christian religion is a case in point. The Charter of the United Nations supports freedom of worship and religion as a fundamental human right. It is therefore not interference in the domestic affairs of another country  where there are violations of the Charter on this ground  to urge an end to the persecution of people because of their religious or political belief. Humanity and compassion demand that as a country we do so. We seek respect for our institutions and will require that those who act in conflict with provisions of the Charter desist from so doing. 152.	It is being contended that the world economy is coming out of its long recessionâthat is  of course  if viewed from the vantage point of the indexed growth of the different sectors of the world's highly industrialized economies. Seen from the small and developing economies  the scenario is different.153.	Further  it is being suggested that the developing and underdeveloped countries will benefit from the end of the recession and the expansion of the economy of the industrialized countries. The only question is how and when. We will  it is said  benefit from the much talked about trickle-down effect. But this supposes that  as the industrialized economies expand through greater consumer demand for basic products  the poor countries will benefit from increased purchases of their primary products and  through this increased demand  obtain higher prices. In this way some of the accumulated wealth of the industrialized countries through purchases will trickle down to poorer countries and throughout different sectors of the economy.154.	We do not doubt that the trickle-down effect will occur. The problem is within what time frame and the rate of that trickle. In the underdeveloped and developing countries  we needâand this is in an analogous mannerâmuch water to survive  not a trickle. The pool must be filled quickly if millions are to survive and if death and suffering are to be averted. Where the land is dry and thirsty  the trickle will disappear and the land will still be thirsty. The trickle creates a mirage  wets the thirst  heightens expectation and makes the thirst all the more unbearable. We need more than the trickle. We need an increased flow to fill the pond quickly  so that the thirst might be assuaged.155.	If this nascent recovery is to grow  underdeveloped and developing countries must have  not a trickle  but an increased flow of aid to stimulate further world trade and promote meaningful development in the world that now lives in hope and expectation. Notwithstanding existing national programmes of bilateral assistance  there is need for increased flows of funding to regional and international institutions for loans to poorer countries to enhance governmental efforts and to ensure the dynamism of growth in the expectant worldâa world characterized by high birth and mortality rates  unemployment  disease and chronic poverty  persistent balance-of-payments problems or budgetary deficits.156.	The developing and underdeveloped parts of the world represent a very significant portion of the world's population. Our economy represents the greatest potential for expansion because of our low economic base. All funding therefore for expanding growth in these areas will be for the mutual benefit of the industrialized countries as well as the developing and underdeveloped. The interdependence of the world economy is not a clichÃ©; it is a fact of life. To forget this is to have a distorted vision of the real world. We cannot stand alone or aloof. We must either stand together to succeed  or stand alone or in small groups and fail.157.	We of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines urge the 24 rich countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and others  such as those of the Development Assistance Committee  to contribute in a more generous manner to the resources of the International Development Association and to the International Finance Corporation. If the present recovery is to be strengthened further there is need for a strong injection of concessionary capital. A strong level of support must be directed to IMF to assist debtor countries in tiding over their balance-of-payments problems. It is  I believe  the only way to improve liquidity and advance world-wide trade  coupled with measures taken to reduce interest rates. World prosperity  as I have said  is an indispensable and interdependent effort; let us not believe that size  industrial strength or wealth can change that. We may all sink together with adverse consequences for all  though it may be more severe for some than others; or we can all rise together in common prosperity for the present and in the future. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines hopes that the world community will rise together.158.	Present problems have compelled others to ask: is there not the need for a new economic order? Whether or not that question is valid we must accept that the 1944 world of Bretton Woods  the world of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes  has changed drastically âand that is  I may say  decidedly for the better today  even though problems exist. A world now in which more national pride and consciousness exist  a world in which stultified human resources no longer exist or are not as pervasive and are now liberated for the forward motion of nation-building  the development of society and of the total individual  was then a world where less than 50 countriesâmost of them rulersâ ruled the rest. Today 158 Member States are represented in the Assembly  more than three times the number in 1944  including many of the ruled. It is clear  then  that the reality of 1944 must be different from that of today. Whether the institutions of Bretton Woods are changed is not the only question  but rather the acceptance that there is need for serious examination of the institutions and their effectiveness in meeting the needs of the newer Members and how best they can respond to those needs.159.	There is a Commonwealth initiative in this area. It needs the support of the Assembly. We are to ensure that the international machinery functions fairly  that GATT works fairly  that UNCTAD functions in the best interest of all  and that the World Bank and IMF do not become an exclusive club of rich countries and thereby not respond effectively to the needs of the poor.160.	We still live in a world with divided countries and where effort is being made either by both parts of the divided country or by one to have a unified country and end the separation of family and friends to create greater strength out of unity. Some of these divided countries possess large populations the continued division of which will create strains and tensions in the international community. To achieve reunification will never be easy  but the path of dialogue must be pursued to find the ground for common understanding and thereby dissolve the fears and mistrust that exist among the peoples of divided countries. Weâall of usâshould consequently endeavour to promote this process. Once again I urge that  where admission to the world Organization is required and possible  no part of a divided country which wishes to participate in the councils of the Assembly should be denied that right through the exercise of a veto. I believe that course of action to be right  if our search here is for the reduction of tension.161.	For yet another year we seem incapable of bringing peace by our collective efforts to troubled Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Western Sahara and Central America. The partition of Lebanon is beginning to take place before our very eyes. Spheres of influence are being established. After three years the war between Iran and Iraq still continues  with periodic intensity and the potential for escalation. All those events seek to make a mockery of the Charter of the United Nations. The Charter is our servant  if we would let it serve us. Our predecessors  the framers  were determined then to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and thereby end untold sorrow for mankind. They reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the individual  with equal rights for all and for nations large and small.162.	They were determined to establish conditions to promote social progress  a better life in greater freedom with justice and with respect for international obligations. They accepted that there was need for tolerance and to live as nations together in peace.163.	It would be well for all of us here  the heirs and inheritors  who today bear the torch  lit on 26 June 1945 at San Francisco  to recommit ourselves to the principles enshrined in Article 1  Article 2  paragraphs 3 and 4  and Article 33 of the Charter.164.	Why must the peace process be so difficult and the conditions for maintaining the means for waging war so relatively easy? Is it the fear to offend which makes us so tolerant of injustice or are we so frustrated by the hopelessness of finding solutions that we have begun to become uncaring spectators? If we accept that we are powerless to act  when will sanity be restored and who will restore that sanity? When will the voices of countless thousands of innocent old men  women and children rise up world-wide to plead with us to end their suffering and possible death? When will the young  who are combatants and who no longer control their destiny  be spared the certain future of death or dismemberment? When will they own their lives to build a future in keeping with their vision of that future?165.	It may be that peace may always and forever be an illusion  or perhaps  on a world basis  never attainable. But can we accept that this is to be the bleak future for mankind? It must not be. To enjoy the fullest experience in life we must all have hopeâthat hope brings reassurance that we can work for a peaceful world order. This must be our hope if we are to banish the spectre of unemployment  poverty and hunger.166.	There must therefore be peace and justice for all in Kampuchea. There must  therefore  be peace and justice for all in Afghanistan. There must be peace and justice for all in Central America. There can be no other way forward. There must be an end to violence. Let us commit ourselves to this purpose. Let us dare to hope that it can be attained.167.	In concluding  it is with great pleasure I welcome the admission of Saint Christopher and Nevis to the United Nations. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is of the same region and we are members of many of the same regional organizations. Because of this special knowledge I am convinced that Saint Christopher and Nevis  though small  will be a responsible and responsive Member of the world community  and that wise counsel will prevail in her future.168.	I end  as I began  with you  Mr. President  and now wish you a fruitful and tension-reducing term of office. May history record this as a watershed of change. May the economic climate of change expand into a political climate for change. With our right to hope and dream  we should work in our quest for peace and social justice  relentlessly  so that those whose future depends on us may be reassured."
"141",7351,"VEN",38,1983,"ï»¿120.	 It is no mere formality  Sir  for me to convey to you the satisfaction of my country and my personal pleasure at your election as President. This is not simply because you are a Latin American  because your country is abundantly qualified for that distinction or because you have demonstrated in your every action competence and a vocation to serve which guarantee the successful conduct of our work. Beyond all these relevant facts  it is of very special significance to us that a Panamanian is presiding over the General Assembly in the year when we are commemorating the bicentennial of the birth of the Liberator  Simon Bolivar.121.	Panama M a permanent testimony to the political genius of Bolivar. The Amphictyonic Congress  convened by him on the Isthmus of Panama in 1826  was the forerunner of this international Organization and of the formulation of the basic rules for the maintenance of international peace and security.122.	It is appropriate also to convey  on behalf of my country  the sincere gratitude of Venezuelans for the interest shown by this Organization and the representatives of Member States in the commemoration of this important anniversary. Today  more than ever  in the midst of the conflicts and uncertainties which darken the international outlook  the tireless struggle of the Liberator Simdn Bolivar for the freedom of peoples and the dignity of man should be an inspiration to us.123.	Imbued with this spirit  the heads of State of Venezuela  Colombia  Ecuador  Peru and Bolivia  and you  Mr. President  as the representative of Panama  meeting in Caracas on the anniversary of Bolivar's birth  signed a Manifesto to the Peoples of Latin America  which has been duly distributed to the States Members of the United Nations	It is a reaffirmation of the Bolivarian ideals  as applied to the main current problems of our region.124.	In our time  those ideals of unity and freedom take on new forms in a variety of links that unite the peoples of the Bolivarian republics; they are to be found with fresh force in relations among American nations; they place us among the developing countries; and they provide the banner under which the final end of colonialism and the prevention of acts of aggression and interference by the great Powers will be achieved.125.	The ceremony commemorating the bicentennial of the Liberator  held last July here at United Nations Headquarters  was very gratifying to Venezuelans. A former President of Venezuela  Mr. Rafael Caldera  delivered an address  as did representatives of the other countries liberated by Bolivar  and representatives of all the regions of the world.126.	The wide participation which this commemoration attracted in this Organization' 1 is irrefutable proof that the Bolivarian ideals of independence  self-determination and equality have become realities based on the same aspirations to self-betterment and justice in the brotherhood of peoples of other continents  especially Africa and Asia. It is a clear expression of solidarity among the peoples of the third world.127.	For us  the accession to independence of the new American nation of Saint Christopher and Nevis and its admission to membership in the United Nations are similarly a source of special satisfaction.128.	It is profoundly disturbing that situations of force tenaciously persist  without regard for the rights of peoples and individuals.129.	No objective progress has been achieved regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea or Afghanistan. Furthermore  Chad has now been added to the list of African countries in the internal problems of which foreign troops are intervening. And the world public seems to have forgotten the existence of an open state of war between Iran and Iraq  although it is now in its third year and could still potentially provoke an uncontrollable conflagration.130.	The situation in Lebanon gets worse by the hour. It is therefore necessary to assist and support the suffering people of that country to bring that long and tragic quarrel to an end and create an atmosphere conducive to dialogue and detente  so that their most intrinsic values and rights may become effective realities and their nation may regain its territorial integrity and enjoy the free exercise of its sovereignty. To this end  peaceful coexistence and reconciliation must be sought among the various groups which make up the Lebanese nation  and outside influences must be suppressed  since they tend rather to deepen and exacerbate the differences between those groups.131.	In the mean time  the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people are no nearer realization  and South Africa maintains its artificial obstacles to the independence of Namibia.132.	Understandably  international public opinion is profoundly conscious of these open breaches of world peace  which involve various countries or groups of countries. But we should not forget that peace 3s not just the absence of war. It is far more than that; it is the total absence of any kind of violence. Thus  it would take forever to list every kind and focal point of violence existing within certain States which lead to the proliferation of further major conflicts and in the end reach the international arena.133.	It is important and useful to use all possible means to prevent these internal disputes since experience has shown that once they reach major proportions there is much less likelihood of finding effective solutions.134.	In these circumstances  action by the Secretary- General  however energetic and persistent  is not enough to quench all the trees  seeing the scantiness of the means available to him.135.	The international community must overcome what appears to be a growing indifference to these constant breaches of the peace and the law and give its most resolute support to action by the Organization to restore the disrupted normal conditions.136.	All Member countries  large and small  individually and collectively  have a contribution to make in this endeavor. Indifference or resignation or the belief that only the super-Powers have solutions to the problems inevitably leads to an aggravation of the conflicts and increases the danger of a final catastrophic confrontation.137.	What is known as the Contadora initiative  in which joint action is being taken by Colombia  Mexico  Panama and Venezuela to prevent the territory of our Central American brothers from becoming a battlefield for contending blocs  is the peaceful outcome of our conviction that members of the international community must participate in the solution of regional and world problems.138.	In my opinion there are solid grounds for optimism about the possibility of satisfactory and permanent solutions being found.139.	In their endeavors  the countries of the Contadora Group have adhered strictly to the principle of nonintervention. Without preconceived ideas or self-seeking  the countries of the Group  always with objectivity and impartiality  have tried to foster the search for solutions which are acceptable to the countries concerned  through dialogue and negotiation.140.	Non-intervention attains its true expression when it is based on the full exercise of self-determination. Self- determination is the foundation of non-intervention  because  starting from the principle that man is free  it follows that peoples must be free also. There can be no excuse for invoking non-intervention in order to deprive peoples of their freedom  since universal solidarity  whose roots lie in one and the same human condition  prevails over national differences.141.	If we  the peoples of the third world  have been the most active defenders of non-intervention as a fundamental principle of international order and of coexistence between nations  it hay been precisely because intervention practiced by powerful nations has prevented the will of our peoples from being unreservedly expressed.142.	Today we consider the principle of non-intervention to mean that every people may exercise its right to self-determination. We cannot accept non-intervention as a rhetorical expedient under the cover of which some people or groups of people thwart the will of the peoples.143.	In 1979  when the situation prevailing in the Nicaragua of the Somoza dictatorship was being debated in the Organization of American States  Venezuela  in joint action with the other countries of the Andean Pact  pushed for recognition of the principle of solidarity among peoples  superseding national barriers  because what was at stake was the fight for respect for human rights and for the very principle of self-determination of peoples.144.	Repeated and periodic expressions of the will of the people  free and untrammeled  is a prerequisite for peace among nations. Accordingly  we believe that the establishment of a stable peace in Central America presupposes a sustained thrust to institutionalize democracy in the region.145.	The Contadora Group  in its efforts  has taken into account the social and economic conditions of the countries in the region. To lessen tensions in the area it is essential to work constantly to overcome the conditions of social injustice.146.	Political difficulties  the arms traffic  armed uprisings  border tensions  and mistrust heightened by all these  factors  spur on the arms race  which in turn raises the level of tension and absorbs resources which would be better channeled into economic and social development.147.	The strengthening of democratic institutions in all the countries of the region seems to us to be the way to break this vicious circle; hence our insistence on considering the process of establishing democracy and respect for pluralism as the first step to consolidating peace.148.	Peace will not necessarily bring freedom; rather it is freedom which will serve as the foundation for peace.149.	Peace among and within the nations of Central America will be consolidated through an expression of the will of the people. In exercising their right to self- determination  the peoples will find a way to co-exist. Doing away with this consultation of the will of the people  falsifying the results of such consultations or merely ignoring them  are factors which undermine faith in democracy and impel peoples to seek solutions by force.150.	One cannot therefore invoke the difficulties which in any given situation argue against the practice of consulting the will of the people  because postponement  far from helping to improve the situation  will tend to worsen it and hence to increase the probability of widespread violence.151.	In the Manifesto to the Peoples of Latin America mentioned earlier  the Presidents of the Bolivarian republics expressed that concept very clearly  pointing out that:""The systematic and recurrent practice of holding elections not only represents the sole means of legitimizing the exercise of power  but alsoâthrough the natural alternation characterizing this system  when accompanied by the necessary safeguards to ensure that the will of the people is effectively expressed through those electionsâconstitutes the most effective means not only of enabling pluralism to provide a vehicle  for the expression of ideas  tendencies and opinions in the utmost freedom  but also of ensuring that respect for the rights of others on an equal footing with one's own is instilled in the hearts of men and becomes a permanent way of life  since this is the only means for society to develop in peace.""152.	The Contadora initiative is an interesting example of sub regional co-operation in an endeavor to solve locally problems of common interest in the face of strong tensions and attempts by power centers outside the sub- region to bring pressure to bear.153.	We  the Contadora Group countries  are aware of our abilities and our limitations. We want a sub-regional solution  but we are aware of the existence of an East- West confrontation and of the impossibility of bringing it to an end. We are making a great effort to mobilize every country in the sub region  although we realize that we have no power to impose measures or to bring pressure to bear to have them accepted. This is our weakness and at the same time our strength. The Central American countries are beginning to rebuild their confidence  encouraged by the presence of witnesses of good faith who cannot  indeed have no wish or claim to  achieve positions of hegemony.154.	In this connection  the four heads of State of the member countries of the Contadora Group stated in the Cancun Declaration on Peace in Central America:""It is also necessary that other States with interests in and ties to the region should use their political influence in helping to strengthen the channels of understanding and should unreservedly commit themselves to the diplomatic approach to peace."" 155.	However  it is not sufficient for the States of the region to act in a constructive manner. It is also essential for all States to refrain from any actions that might further aggravate the conflict. In this sense it is highly regrettable that countries which have never had any major links with the countries of the sub region  and whose interest in it has always been as remote as their geographical position  should display a growing presence on one side or the other  for reasons which are apparently far from real concern for the welfare of the Central Americans.156.	I should like to express the sincere gratitude of the Government of Venezuela  which is doubtless shared by the other members of the Contadora Group  for the broad support we have received from other Member countries of the United Nations for the efforts being made under the guidance of the heads of State of the four republics.157.	At the very time when the world is celebrating the 35th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the persistence of that insult to human dignity which is the policy of apartheid  enshrined in the legislation of the South African regime  is particularly painful. Recently my country had the honor of being host to the Latin American Regional Conference for Action against apartheid  organized by the Special Committee against in which Governments  intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and eminent public leaders and experts participated. The Declaration  adopted at that Conference  states that""is an inhuman system of racist domination and exploitation  a negation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and  indeed  a crime against humanity"" . It also proclaims ""thesolidarity of the Governments and peoples of Latin America with the Governments and peoples of Africa in their struggle for the total emancipation of their continent and for peace  freedom and justice"".158.	We are proud that this solidarity was proclaimed at Caracas  and we are proud to have been of use to a cause which we defend and understand  because reason and truth are its foundations and because we do not understand how the stability of a society can be based on the"" degradation of human dignity. 15. in reiterating our determination to continue a constant fight against racism and racial discrimination  and to give our firmest co-operation to the international and regional crusade against apartheid  we recall with admiration a man who is today the symbol of the struggle against racial prejudice and who is for that reason serving a sentence of imprisonment in South Africaâ Nelson Mandela  who is under detention for fighting the apartheid regime and for advocating justice and human rights and the rights of peoples  and who was denied permission to participate in the ceremony conferring upon him the Simon Bolivar International Prize of UNESCO.160.	The South African regime's scorn for world public opinion is not limited to its practice of racism. In addition  it includes a recalcitrant attitude to the demand for the independence of Namibia. The Secretary- General's efforts to achieve progress in this difficult situation have our fullest support.161.	The lack of progress on disarmament causes Venezuela grave concern. We view disarmament as the necessary means to ensure and maintain international peace and security  since the present balance of power  based on the possession of the largest possible number of weapons  far from bringing us the security that we all seek  is leading us step by step towards an ever more precarious situation  which could end in the outbreak of a nuclear war  with the devastating results that we fear. Unfortunately  the present situation is characterized by a deadlock in the negotiations intended to achieve partial agreements on disarmament  and indeed it even seems that we have lost ground in comparison with the slight advances achieved earlier.162.	The growing confrontation between the two most powerful countries on earth is a drama that is being watched with alarm by the other countries of the world  whose only means of action is to raise their voices to call for the return to sanity. This anxiety-ridden atmosphere has just been tragically emphasized by the destruction by the Soviet air force of a passenger aircraft of Korean Air Lines. This act  totally unjustifiable in any circumstances  might have been avoided had there been a different climate in relations between the main power centers.163.	The world economic crisis  which has a particularly serious effect on the developing countries  has impelled those countries recently to undertake intensive efforts in the Held of international economic relations. The need to deal with this situation is being urged at many forums and meetings  and there are insistent calls for appropriate study and action on what is now the decisive question for the future of mankind and for world peace.164.	It has been pointed out repeatedly that the present crisis is structural. It has been demonstrated that it is neither the result of temporary conditions nor a cyclical phenomenon and that there is no chance of recoveryâ perhaps even of survivalâunless consistent emergency and long-term measures are taken to bring about profound changes in structures and to transform the whole economic system.165.	The efforts made by the developing countries have been seriously affected. We are facing simultaneously a fall in the prices of raw materials  a rise in the prices of manufactured imports  intensified protectionism and high interest rates in the developed countries. High interest rates in particular have been a determining factor in the loss of equilibrium in the balance of payments of the developing countries  with a corresponding effect on their possibilities of economic and social progress.166.	There has been repeated condemnation of the fact that the minimum targets for international co-operation have not been met. This failure  among other things  has led increasingly to recourse to international loans  which today amount to the overwhelming sum of 630 billion United States dollars  with the result that about 40 per cent of the export earnings of developing countries is absorbed by the servicing of that debt.167.	Furthermore  production growth rates have fallen  both in the developing countries and in the industrialized world. In 1982 the value of world trade fell by 6 per cent. In addition  commodity prices fell further to record low levels  and their real value fell to the lowest level for the past 50 years; this helped to lower inflation  but only in the developed countries.168.	Added to this were protectionist and discriminatory policies which have created a concentration of power  thus preventing the developing countries from exercising their right to participate on an equal basis in international trade.169.	During the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Belgrade  a set of measures was proposed which could have made a significant contribution to the restructuring that we are discussing. We all know that once again an opportunity has been lost. That is why we feel impelled to point out to the Powers which bear the most responsibility  which exercise the most influence  that they made a mistake in not understanding the urgency of the situation or the pressing need for multilateral action as the only sensible and effective way to find solutions.170.	Nor have we succeeded in launching the global negotiations  because of the negative attitude of the greatest economic Power in the world. This attitude has precluded any move towards a harmonious and coherent outcome of the crisis  towards a scheme based on the co-operation and understanding which is the very spirit of the world Organization and of the system of specialized and regional agencies.171.	The developing countries  on the other hand  have shown great flexibility  and have changed many of their own proposals with a view to undertaking joint coherent action to assist national efforts. But national efforts cannot replace a global approach  with full and responsible participation by both developing and developed countries.172.	A major part of our collective efforts has been devoted to strengthening and implementing the Caracas Programme of Action of May 1981.7 We have singled out many fields in which there are both opportunities and complete readiness to co-operate: trade  food and agriculture  energy  raw materials  financing  industrialization and technical co-operation.173.	One can envisage the immense possibilities for mutual assistance offered by complementarity both now and in the future. While at Caracas we believed that the potential was already there  two and a half years after our fruitful meeting we have not only confirmed this fact  but have also realized that there is an extraordinary and deep-seated will not only to strengthen co-operation  to have closer links  but to translate our decision to achieve solidarity into reality.174.	In Latin America we have worked hard to strengthen co-operation and broaden economic relations among the countries of the region  particularly in the Andean area  where we have established what is perhaps the most important integration scheme in the developing world.175.	The Andean Pact seeks not only to improve the domestic standards of living in the member countries but also to prepare a collective position that will enable us to incorporate this group of countries into the scheme of international economic relations within more equitable parameters.176.	The international crisis itself and the indifference of those who do not feel its adverse effects as we do compel us to redouble our efforts. This was placed on record in the Declaration on Sub regional Integration issued by the Andean Presidents  in July of this year  and I quote:""We have decided to give fresh impetus to the process of integration by revising its goals  updating its programmes of action in the international and subregional contexts and improving its instruments  drawing on the experience gained in the 14 years since the signing of the Cartagena Agreement. We are convinced that the strengthening of Andean integration will significantly bolster Latin America's efforts to meet the challenges created by the crisis."" 177.	The President of Venezuela  Luis Herrera Cam- pins  has devoted special attention to solving the economic and social problems we are facing today. His active participation in the most important efforts to correct North-South inequality is widely known. His view of the economic problems of development and of relations between the North and South has always been framed in a spirit of dialogue and understanding. His most recent statements on this important topic were made in Caracas at the opening of the conferences at the ministerial level of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council of the Organization of American States and of the Council of the Latin American Economic System. At these Conferences we were able to assess the efforts made to find solutions and make proposals for the solution of both regional and global problems. At the first of those meetings  President Herrera Campins said:""We want concerted solutions  which should proceed from the need to determine the real causesâ structural and circumstantialâof the crisis  so that the formulas for solutions approved here will have a more solid foundation  solutions which are to be transmitted to the Inter-American Economic and Social Council for final approval.""We are not asking anything of the industrialized countries that would be beyond the realm of what is possible and proper.""178.	The results of that meeting offer a glimmer of light in the darkness that characterizes the attempts at a systematic North-South dialogue that would make it possible to lay the foundation for a more just economic order based on solidarity. This was emphasized by President Herrera Campins a few days later at the opening of the meeting of the Council of SELA to which we referred earlier  when  in summing up the achievements of the Special Conference on External Financing of the Organization of American States  he said:""It is worthwhile recalling that it was the calm  firm and constructive presence of Latin America in that North-South hemisphere scenario which made it possible  albeit somewhat hesitantly  to pry open the doors to a dialogue with the United States of America which we believe is necessary and cannot be delayed. To achieve unanimity in approving the 'Bases for an Understanding'  with all the conceptual burden of that formulation  represents a very important step which will have most far-reaching effects in the years to come  provided that we know how to conduct ourselves in unity and with flexibility in undertaking the major tasks the times demand of us.""179.	Along the same line of regional action  an important event was the meeting of personal representatives of heads of State and Government of Latin America and the Caribbean  which was held at Santo Domingo at the beginning of last month to prepare a Latin American economic conference that  on the initiative of the President of Ecuador  is to be held at Quito this year.180.	If we arrive at an overview of the efforts that we Latin Americans are pursuing  we can see that to the aforementioned initiatives by Contadora  SELA  the Andean Pact and the coordinated activities within the inter-American organizations  we have to add other sub- regional efforts and initiatives  such as those carried out in conjunction with the Latin American Integration Association  the Caribbean Community  the Treaty for Amazonian Co-operation  as well as those of the River f ate Basin Treaty and the Agreement of San Jos6. All of this makes us aware of how our family of nations is setting an active example in its quest for solidarity and co-operation.181.	We have noted with interest the documents submitted to us on the Malvinas Islands  which reaffirm the obligation of the parties to negotiate on the question of sovereignty.182.	The outcome of the tragic confrontation in the South Atlantic should in no way lead the United Kingdom to think that the successful use of force has created the slightest right in its favor or has in any way obliterated the illegality of its possession of the Malvinas Islands. As the English themselves are wont to say  ""Two wrongs do not make a right"". For Venezuela  neither the passage of time nor any other circumstance can legalize the occupation by extra-continental Powers of any territory of the American republics which are already independent.183.	For this reason of principle  Venezuela will never accept the consolidation of the plunder of which our territory was a victim after independence  at the hands of the British Empire. At the same time  Venezuela cannot lose sight of the fact that its principal interlocutor at present is no longer the British Empire  the perpetrators of the seizure  but the sister-nation of Guyana  whose people was likewise a victim of colonialism and which  like Venezuela  has to face the difficult problems which confront all developing countries.184.	Venezuela has acted in this spirit from the very moment that Guyana acceded to independence. It has always sought to present its legitimate claims with a view to a peaceful settlement  in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. Thus  in 1966  we signed the Geneva Agreement/ whereby both countries committed themselves to finding satisfactory solutions for the practical settlement of the territorial problem.185.	It is regrettable that through the years which have gone by since then  the Government of Guyana has not had the breadth of vision to realize that sincere and frank negotiations with Venezuela on the final settlement of the problem which both countries inherited  besides being fair and right  would also be in the best interests of both peoples.186.	The Geneva Agreement to which I have already referred made provision for the parties to request assistance from the Secretary-General of the United Nations in finding a peaceful means of solution. This procedure is now under way and the Government of Venezuela is particularly pleased to note that thanks to the efforts of the Secretary-General both personally and through the effective intermediary of the Under-Secretary-General for Special Political Affairs  there are positive signs which seem to warrant optimism regarding the establishment of a propitious climate in relations between our two countries for finally reaching a satisfactory practical settlement which will put an end to the dispute in a peaceful and friendly way.187.	America and the world are commemorating the bicentennial of the birth of the Liberator Simon Bolivar. He gave us not only freedom and independence  but also an enduring ideal  which neither fades nor withers  which cannot be extinguished or altered. ""Bolivar still has much to do in America""  said Jose Marti. Proof of this lies in the splendid practical results of Bolivarian ideals. Bolivar is still present in relations between nations  in the promotion of equality and the prevention of subjugation. He is present in multilateral diplomacy on the side of the weak and developing peoples of the third world. Bolivar is here in the United Nations as the standard-bearer in the struggle to put an end to colonialism  prevent great- Power aggression and interference  seek a peaceful settlement of conflicts and defend human rights and public liberties. Bolivar is also present in the United Nations specialized agencies in the efforts to improve the terms of trade  prevent economic exploitation  defend industrial workers and farmers and improve health and education  because he anticipated the structure and philosophy of the organizations which sustain the progress and improvement of the human condition.188.	When there is a tragic world crisis  a financial and economic crisis  a monetary and commercial crisis  crisis of political values and ideological concepts  a crisis of social and economic programmes  a moral crisis characterized by the weakening of ethical values and the invasion of pragmatic practices  a crisis of faith in the ideals of civilization and culture  an overwhelming crisis because of the technological supremacy of the most destructive offensive weapons man has ever devised  I invoke the name of Simon Bolivar as a shield  an ideal  a safeguard of the preservation of freedom  peace  order and progress for our peoples and for all mankind. Two hundred years after his birth  the Liberator is here  showing us the way and illuminating it with his example."
"142",7390,"VNM",38,1983,"36.	 First of all  Mr. President  I wish to congratulate you most cordially on your election to the highest office of the thirty-eighth session. This brilliant election is a well-deserved ratification of your talents and personal experience and of the role played by Panama and Latin America in the cause of peace and independence in the world.37.	I warmly congratulate Mr. Imre Hollai  President of the thirty-seventh session  for his important contributions to the results achieved at that session in extremely difficult circumstances  thanks to his dynamic and skilful guidance of its work.38.	The Secretary-General has worked tirelessly throughout the past year to promote a greater degree of understanding and compromise on difficult questions. He deserves our gratitude for all his inestimable contributions to the improvement of the international climate.39.	I extend sincere greetings to Mrs. Indira Gandhi  Prime Minister of India  who  in her capacity as Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  brought us  the message of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi  and who has worked tirelessly to ensure that the thirty-eighth session would be crowned with success for the sake of peace  independence  democracy and social progress in the world.40.	Finally  I wish to take this opportunity to extend best wishes and a warm welcome to Saint Chrisopher and Nevis  a new Member the United Nations.41.	The current session is taking place against a background of very serious international tension. The horrendous threat represented by colossal arsenals of nuclear weapons weighs heavily upon mankind. The arms race is proceeding on an unprecedented scale and relations between the Soviet Union and the United States have become dangerously strained.42.	Flashpoints around the world  particularly in Central America and Lebanon  are reaching the point of explosion. Military manoeuvres and demonstrations of force have occurred throughout the worldâparticularly in Central America  the Middle East and the Pacific- accompanied by interventions and threats of aggression and of a second lesson against the independence and sovereignty of peoples.43.	The world economic crisis has grown worse. Trade and monetary wars have been unleashed. An unprecedented escalation of foreign indebtedness has led a number of developing countries to a state bordering on despair. The gap between the developed industrial countries and the developing countries is constantly growing wider  while the solution to the grave problems posed by international economic relations is still impeded.44.	The three aforementioned fundamental aspects of the present international situation  being closely linked to each other and having a great influence on one another  are leading to a very serious  sensitive situation that could easily explode. All that is needed to lead the world into a global crisis with unforeseeable consequences is a single irresponsible act by a single statesman. Such a situation requires from all statesmen a high sense of responsibility towards world peace and security.45.	Until late August 1983 mankind noted that there had been a little progress in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and placed great hopes in future meetings between the leaders of the two countries. Suddenly  the South Korean aircraft incident produced a grave crisis in the world  cancelling the much-desired meetings between the United States and the Soviet Union and plunging this session into a stifling cold-war atmosphere. It is regrettable that civilian lives were lost in that incident. Civilians were used to cover up a far-reaching espionage venture  and their death has been used for political ends. Conscientious and thoughtful men ask why the United States authorities have used that aircraft incident to set in motion such an extraordinarily rapid reaction  together with an extremely thorough campaign of mass hysteria on a world-wide level  leading mankind to the threshold of a global crisis.46.	It will be recalled that those now raising such a din over the spy plane affair were precisely the ones who completely fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964 and used it as a pretext to launch their aggression against Viet Nam. The secret documents known as the Pentagon Papers  made public in 1968  have already fully exposed this gross act of treachery. It is therefore quite easy to understand how  in an atmosphere overheated by the South Korean aircraft incident  the United States Congress has adopted the largest peacetime military budget.47.	It is true that the policy of the United States is one of tensions and crisesâa policy dictated by the interests of its global strategy. The United States has declared that the period of detente in the 1970s was not profitable to it at all. Since the end of the 1970s  it has set in motion its policy designed to create tensions  undermine East- West detente and speed up the arms race to secure maximum economic and political advantages for itself. Protagonists of political adventurism are working overtime to revive anticommunist hysteria and rekindle tensions in the world in order to go back to the cold-war period and to the brinkmanship policies of the 1950s.48.	In the economic sphere the United States is doing its utmost to preserve the current unfair world economic order. It is impeding the opening of North-South global negotiations and has caused the failure of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. It has maintained its refusal to sign the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It has sought to ensure its economic recovery to the detriment of all other countries.49.	It is obvious that the United States is not prepared to enter into negotiations aimed at removing injustices in international economic relations  insisting stubbornly instead on using its economic superiority to compel the other countries to abide by the present world economic order.50.	In the political and social spheres  who is it that invariably gives its blessing to all the pro-American dictatorial regimes around the world and opposes all the peoples of countries struggling for independence and freedom and against social injustices? Who invariably supports Israel against the Palestinian and Arab peoples? Who backs the apartheid regime against the South African and Namibian peoples  Angola  Mozambique and other front-line States? Who persists in supporting the bloodthirsty Pinochet clique against the Chilean people? Who supports the bloodthirsty junta in El Salvador against the Salvadorian people? Who has been threatening the Republic of Cuba  the Republic of Nicaragua and the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya? The answers to all those questions are henceforth perfectly dear to all.51.	Striving to maintain its economic and political interests throughout the world to the detriment of those of other peoples  the United States inevitably runs into the dynamic opposition of those peoples. But it does not wish to enter into negotiations to resolve world political and economic problems on the basis of respect for the independence and sovereignty of other countries. Its basic policy is the big stick and the carrotâbut mainly the big stick. The most striking and clearest manifestation of that policy could be seen in the Viet Nam war.52.	The United States ranks first in the world in terms of gross national product and the Soviet Union comes second  its gross national product accounting for only 60 to 70 per cent of that of the United States. With its economic and technological superiority  the United States is the only one which can make a large budgetary allocation for military expenditures to guarantee its military superiority in the world. Its 1984 military budget will be the largest ever in peacetime and the largest in the world. With a much lower gross national product than that of the United States  the other countries cannot spend a comparable amount on the arms race. At present the United States is inventing a supposed Soviet military superiority  just as it thought up the supposed missile gap in the early 1960s in order to force Congress to agree to a reckless increase in military expenditure.53.	Acceleration of the arms race has thus proved to be a long-term United States policy  even during the 1950s when it had a monopoly and superiority in the nuclear field. That is precisely what brought the negotiations on the limitation and reduction of strategic arms and of medium-range missiles to a stop. That is also what has created tension throughout the world.54.	With present-day nuclear arsenals and the arms race  mankind finds itself on the brink of a catastrophe which would spell its own extinction. The general debate during the past days in the General Assembly has brought to light the profound concern of the international community as a whole as to the urgent need to prevent the nuclear arms race from getting out of hand and reaching the point of no return.55.	The socialist countries  non-aligned countries  pence-loving Governments and all peoples throughout the world at this very moment are working hard to strengthen their solidarity and their determination to defend peace. Together  and solidly united  they are certain to confront successfully the danger of a nuclear war of extermination. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam wishes it to be known that it fully supports the proposals of the socialist countries  the non-aligned and other peace-loving countries designed to put an end to the arms race  to promote disarmament  to prevent a nuclear war and to preserve world peace.56.	While they are committed to the prevention of a new world war  the peoples of all countries will have to struggle with equal vigour against local wars. Since the end of the Second World War the international community as a whole has been able to enjoy the longest period of peace in this century. But  notwithstanding the absence of a world war in the last four decades  the quantity of bombs and ammunition used during that period of peace against the struggles for independence and freedom of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America has reached a record in this century. The quantity of bombs and ammunition used in the Viet Nam war alone far exceeded the amount used in both world wars combinedâ and that is not taking into account the quantity of weapons and ammunition used in the war of aggression against Korea and the wars waged by Israel against the Arab peoples and by Pretoria against the South African and the Namibian peoples and against the front-line countries. What is particularly dangerous is that the United States authorities are using their absolute military superiority to intimidate  threaten  directly intervene in and commit aggression against the countries struggling for independence and freedom  countries whose military forces are many times weaker than those of the United States.57.	At the end of the Viet Nam war the United States said that it would make sure that it never became involved in a second Viet Nam. After the Korean war it said that it would not get involved in another war on the Asian continent. However  10 years later it set in motion the Viet Nam war  a war on the Asian continent which was more bloody than the Korean war. The Viet Nam war ended 10 years ago  but the United States is now busily engaged in precisely the same conduct as got it into the Viet Nam war in the first place.58.	At the beginning of the 1960s  the United States Government slandered Viet Nam  accusing it of being a tool of the Soviet Union and China  and criticized the struggle of the Vietnamese people for independence and freedom as being communist expansionism. The United States set itself the duty of defending the so-called free world. Now it is also criticizing the struggle for independence and freedom of the peoples of Nicaragua  El Salvador and other countries in Central America and the Caribbean as communist expansion and East-West rivalry. The United States Secretary of Defense has declared that a military victory will have to be won and the boundaries of the free world clearly drawn in Central America.59.	It is evident that the fabrications about  Communist aggression  are designed to falsify the essence of the struggle for independence and freedom of the peoples of Central America and to provide a pretext for intervention and aggression. It is regrettable that the Chinese authorities have echoed those falsifications by affirming that the two super-Powers are gradually involving Central America in their rivalry and confrontation.60.	Everyone recalls that international public opinion in general and public opinion in the United States vigorously condemned the Viet Nam war. Efforts are now being made  however  to depict that war as a noble cause in order to stir up great-Power chauvinism and impel young Americans into a second Viet Nam war.61.	Twenty years ago the United States authorities set in motion the process by granting military assistance to the puppet administration of South Viet Nam and sending military advisors to train the troops. They sent the Seventh Fleet to parade and manoeuvre up and down the coast of Viet Nam. Now they have been taking identical steps in Central America.62.	In Viet Nam at the time  having sent the Seventh Fleet  the United States authorities fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin incident as a pretext for bombing North Viet Nam and sending air force and missile units to South Viet Nam. Then they invoked the need to defend the air bases and the missile bases and sent the Marines to South Viet Nam.63.	Step by step they escalated their claims from the right of Marines to defend themselves if attacked to their right to attack whatever they felt was a potential danger. Here we have the famous logic of military escalation which led the United States into the bloody Viet Nam war. Each of those actions  unfortunately  is now being repeated in Central America and Lebanon.64.	It is necessary to put an end to acts of intervention and aggression in Central America  the Middle East and other regions of the world while there is still time.65.	Viet Nam fully supports the just struggle of Cuba  Nicaragua  Grenada and Suriname and that of the peoples of El Salvador and Puerto Rico and other Latin American peoples for peace  independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. We welcome the six-point position of the Government of Nicaragua and the efforts of the Contadora Group to find a peaceful solution to the problems of Central America.66.	Viet Nam fully supports the struggle of the Arab peoples  in particular that of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  its authentic and legitimate representative  against the Israeli aggressors. We fully support the struggle of the people of South Africa under the guidance of the African National Congress and of the people of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization	as well as the struggles of Angola  Mozambique and other front-line countries  against the apartheid regime of South Africa. We fully support the struggle of the people of Western Sahara under the leadership of POLISARIO for the exercise of their right to self-determination.67.	We fully support the struggle of the Korean people to bring about the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and for the peaceful reunification of their country  and the struggle of the people of Cyprus to recover their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We fully support the struggle of the people of Afghanistan in defence of the gains of their April revolution.68.	During the last four decades South-East Asia has been the only region of the world ravaged by uninterrupted wars  the bloodiest of which was the Viet Nam war. At present the region is still without peace and stability. This distressing situation has profound historic roots. For 2 000 years those in power in China always considered South-East Asia their traditional sphere of influence  with Viet Nam in particular as their main object of conquest. Since the thirteenth century Thai people have moved south from southern China and invaded the greater part of the Khmer Empire of the Angkor period and of the Lao Kingdom to found the present Kingdom of Thailand. For almost 10 centuries Thailand considered Kampuchea and Laos to be its vassal States and three times committed aggression against Viet Nam.69.	More recently  in the last four decades  Thailand has become the main ally of militarism  colonialism and imperialism against the three Indo-Chinese countries.70.	For its part  throughout that same period China has persistently pursued its aim of subjugating the three Indo- Chinese countries  while at the same time seeking compromises with France and the United States to the detriment of those Indo-Chinese countries.  70. For the past five years China and Thailand  the traditional expansionists and hegemonists with designs on the countries of Indo-China  have acted in collusion with each other to again oppose the three Indo-Chinese countries  with the complicity of the United States and Japan  the former aggressors in Indo-China. 71. It is well known that the three Indo-Chinese countries are the victims of aggression. They have never in their history invaded China or Thailand or any other country. Of course there are problems among the three countries as a result of historical factors  but they are insignificant compared with the crimes committed against them by China and Thailand in the past. The past hundred years in particular have linked the destinies of these three peoples more closely. They shared the same colonial fate and have all been the victims of foreign aggression and of the atrocities of Pol Pot. They have joined in a long struggle to regain and safeguard the independence of the three countries and to help the Kampuchean people to rid themselves of the genocidal Pol Pot regime.72.	Vietnamese volunteers have on three occasions gone to Kampuchea to fight side by side with the Kampuchean people against the colonialists  the imperialists and the genocidal gang of Pol Pot  China's henchman. Twice they have withdrawn from Kampuchea. This time as well the Vietnamese volunteers will withdraw when the security of the People's Republic of Kampuchea is assured.73.	The Kampuchean issue  as well as the question of peace and stability in South-East Asia  in essence involves China's policy of making use of Pol Pot's supporters and acting in collusion with Thailand against the three countries of Indo-China.74.	In their last war against Viet Nam  the American troops led the aggression and the troops of Thailand and South Korea followed them. The United States was clearly exposed as the aggressor. Now China is hiding in the background  behind the scenes. It is using Pol Pot and pitting the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations P4SR4A/}  with Thailand in the fore  against the three Indo-Chinese countries. It is an open secret that Pol Pot is an agent of China  maintained and supplied by China. It is clear that China is now the main obstacle to a peaceful solution in South-East Asia.75.	In an attempt to cover up its expansionist and hegemonistic policy in South-East Asia  China fabricated the so-called Soviet and Vietnamese expansion in the region. After Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Kampuchea had twice undertaken the progressive annual withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteers from Kampuchea  the Peking authorities spread new slanders about a supposed dispatch of massive numbers of Vietnamese civilians in an attempt to vietnamize Kampuchea.76.	Everyone knows that the civilian Vietnamese formerly residing in Kampuchea suffered two atrocious massacres  first by Lon Nol and then by Pol Pot  and have been reduced to one tenth their former number  so that they now constitute a smaller group than the persons of Chinese origin living in that country.77.	It is also well known that there are over 20 million persons of Chinese origin in South-East Asia. These people have a considerable hold on the economies of many countries of the region  and a country was created with a population that is primarily of Chinese origin. For South-East Asia  the Chinese threat comes not only from China  but from within the countries of the region as well.78.	Any effective solution must lead to the termination of the absolutely intolerable state of affairs in which the three Indo-Chinese countries have for the past 40 years constantly been the victims of aggression and intervention  and must guarantee a lasting peace and the independence and sovereignty of all the countries of Southeast Asia free of any outside interference. On the other hand  any solution favouring only one party would not solve any problem and could never bring about peace and stability in the region. Such a solution would be unacceptable.79.	The position of the three Indo-Chinese countries can be clearly stated as follows. First  the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese volunteers from Kampuchea will be carried out concurrently with the complete cessation of the Chinese threat  of the use of Pol Pot supporters to impede the recovery of the Kampuchean people  and of the use of Thai territory against the three Indo-Chinese countries  concurrently with the disarming of the supporters of Pol Pot and the punishment of the genocidal Pol Pot criminals. The People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam have decided to withdraw some of the Vietnamese volunteers from Kampuchea each year and will effect a total withdrawal once the peace and security of Kampuchea are assured. Secondly  the countries of Indo-China and China should sign a treaty of non-aggression and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The two groups of countries  Indo-China and ASEAN  will agree on establishing a zone of peace and stability in South-East Asia  based on the ASEAN proposal for a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality and on the proposal of the Indo- Chinese countries. Thirdly  all countries must respect the sovereign right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own affairs. Fourthly  all sides should acknowledge some form of international guarantee for the agreements reached.80.	The position of the ASEAN countries is to demand that Viet Nam unilaterally withdraw all its troops from Kampuchea  while China  Thailand and the Pol Pot clique are left free to act. This would mean that the Pol Pot clique  recognized by the United Nations as the legal Government  would have the right to reimpose its genocidal rule on the Kampuchean people. The Pol Pot clique would continue to serve as China's instrument in carrying out its hegemonist policy against the three Indo-Chinese countries. During the past 40 years in South-East Asia Thailand has always allied itself with the aggressor and its territory constantly has been used as a base for foreign intervention and aggression against the three countries of Indo-China. These three countries  Kampuchea in particular  have been the constant victims of those aggressions and interventions. The ASEAN countries demand that Kampuchea be neutralized  while Thailand and some other ASEAN countries continue freely to put themselves at the service of foreign aggression and intervention against the three Indo-Chinese countries. This would clearly tie the victim's hands while encouraging the aggressor  a completely unacceptable demand.81.	From 1945 to 1975 foreign Powers imposed 30 years of war on the three countries of Indo-China  which were fighting for independence and freedom. But they were doomed to failure.82.	In the past five years China  in collusion with the United States and Thailand  has forced ASEAN countries to adopt a policy of confrontation and pressure in all spheres  military  economic and diplomatic  against the three Indo-Chinese countries with the intent of imposing a solution benefiting only China  the United States  Thailand and other ASEAN countries. That policy has jeopardized peace and stability in South-East Asia and has further sharpened the memory of the crimes they have committed against the Indo-Chinese people throughout history  as well as during the past 40 years.83.	That policy too has failed. It is now high time to end the confrontation and to settle peacefully all the differences on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The countries of Indo-China are pleased to note the gradual steps towards a dialogue which reflect the common desire to end the confrontation and to enter into negotiations. It is regrettable that only China rejects all the proposals by Viet Nam for an end to the conflict and the resumption of negotiations between the two countries.China has also rejected the proposals of the three Indo- Chinese countries for trades of mutual non-aggression and non-interference. China has invaded Viet Nam and is still threatening to teach Viet Nam a second lesson. This is the clearest example of Chinese hegemonism. In our time all countries  large or small  are equal. There are neither master countries nor pupil countries  neither mother countries nor child countries. Such concepts belong to the realm of the pipe dreams of the former Chinese emperors.84.	China claims that the so-called Kampuchean problem is a matter between Viet Nam and ASEAN. If that is so  why does China oppose dialogue between the ASEAN countries and those of Indo-China? If that is so  why does China consider the Kampuchean problem to be the main obstacle to the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations and demand that the issue be discussed with the Soviet Union instead of leaving it for the ASEAN and Indo-Chinese countries to discuss among themselves?85.	On two occasions China has negotiated  first with France in 1954 for a solution to the Indo-Chinese war  at the expense of the three Indo-Chinese countries; and in 1971-72 with the United States for a solution to the Viet Nam war  again at the expense of the same three countries. At present China  pursuing its hegemonistic policy  also at the expense of the Indo-Chinese countries  seeks to negotiate a solution to the Kampuchean problem. The Soviet Union  however  has categorically rejected this attempt.86.	At the present time there are two different approaches in the search for a solution to the South-East Asia problems  including the Kampuchean issue. They are reflected respectively in the resolutions of the United Nations and the declarations of the summit conferences of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.87.	In the last four years  the United Nations has adopted some erroneous resolutions concerning the admission of the Pol Pot clique into the United Nations and on the so-called Kampuchean question. On the one hand  these resolutions have recognized the genocidal Pol Pot clique  and on the other have supported the erroneous positions of only one side  thus opposing the rebirth of the Kampuchean people  the interests of the Indo-Chinese countries and the cause of peace in Southeast Asia. That is why these resolutions remained a dead letter. If the United Nations persists in this erroneous course it will only become more deeply involved in the impasse over the Kampuchean issue.88.	As a founding Member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council  China has emphatically called for the enforcement of United Nations resolutions on Kampuchea. One may recall that in 1950 China sent one million Chinese volunteers to help the Korean people fight United States aggression. The United States used its majority at the United Nations to have the General Assembly adopt resolutions 498 (V) of 1 February 1951 and resolution 500 (V) of 18 May 1951  condemning China as an aggressor in Korea and demanding the complete withdrawal of the Chinese armed forces from Korea and appealing for an embargo against the People's Republic of China. China rightly rejected these resolutions  and Viet Nam  the socialist countries and other peace-loving countries in the world firmly supported the Chinese position at that time. Now  however  having committed aggression against Viet Nam on its south-east flank through the Pol Pot clique  and along its northern frontier with a 600 000-man army  China has also had recourse  acting in connivance with the United States  to the majority at the United Nations to push through erroneous resolutions  this time condemning the Vietnamese volunteers for having come to help the Kampuchea people. By so doing  paradoxically China has repeated at the United Nations what the United States did at one time against China itself. We find that it is improper for a great power like China to adopt such a thoughtless attitude towards an international organization such as the United Nations.39. For their part  most of the ASEAN countries  which had participated directly or indirectly in the United States war of aggression in Viet Nam  are now working hard  together with the United States and China  to demand that Viet Nam should apply erroneous United Nations resolutions on Kampuchea. However  they are supporting the occupation and annexation of East Timor by Indonesia and that country's refusal to apply Security Council resolutions 384 (1975) and 389 (1976)  as well as resolutions adopted invariably since 1975 by the General Assembly on the question of East Timor. Similarly  they have supported Indonesia's rejection of decisions taken on East Timor by various summit conferences and ministerial conferences of the non-aligned countries.90.	While the United Nations has adopted erroneous resolutions on Kampuchea  in the last four years the movement of Non-Aligned Countries has come to adopt judicious positions with regard to the representation of Kampuchea and the situation in South-East Asia  including Kampuchea  at its Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government  held at Havana in 1979  and at its Seventh Conference  at New Delhi in 1983  as well as at its various conferences of foreign ministers since 1981. These conferences of non-aligned countries decided to leave Kampuchea's seat vacant since 1979 and endorsed a comprehensive solution for all the questions of Southeast Asia  including that of Kampuchea. These decisions were adopted unanimously  and the two groups of countries of South-East Asia  that is ASEAN and Indo-China  welcomed them and accepted them.91.	We now find ourselves  therefore  in the presence  on the one hand  of United Nations resolutions on Kampuchea which support one group of countries in Southeast Asia and oppose the other  and on the other hand  of the resolutions of the Non-Aligned Movement  which have been adopted by both parties. Given this situation  we feel that the only path to follow is that of helping the two groups of countries of South-East Asia to embark upon negotiations based on the principles of equality and mutual respect and on the basis of the resolutions of the Non-Aligned Movement.92.	The international community  and in particular the peace-loving countries  and the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America  which have recently thrown off the colonial yoke  place great hopes in the United Nations in the quest for peace  stability and justice. However  as the Secretary-General has rightly observed in his report on the work of the Organization  1983 is  a frustrating year ... for those who believe that the United Nations is the best available international instrumentality to achieve these ends .93.	These observations of the Secretary-General prove to be judicious with regard to the role played by the United Nations with regard to South-East Asia  not only in 1983 but throughout the entire history of that region in the 38 years of the Organization's existence.94.	The realities of those 38 years have amply demonstrated the impotence of the United Nations in the face of uninterrupted wars of aggression with great bloodshed which have been waged against the three Indo-Chinese countries  even though those wars were condemned by many States Members of the United Nations.95.	Since 1943  the majority of the Members of the United Nations have remained silent while tens of millions of tons of bombs and munitions were being dropped by the aggressors on the territories of Indo-Chinese countries. Not only were the aggressors not punished  but they are still sitting in the seats of permanent members of the Security Council while their victims remain outside the Organization and do not benefit from its protection.96.	It should be noted that four countries  permanent members of the Security Council  have committed aggression against the three countries of Indo-China. The Soviet Union is the only permanent member of the Security Council which has  with all other peace-loving countries  invariably supported our struggle for national independence.97.	In the last five years China has pressured the majority at the United Nations into opposing the Indo-Chinese countries. Instead of raising high the banner of the protection of human rights  the United Nations has recognized the genocidal Pol Pot criminals  the very ones who should have been judged and punished by an international court similar to the Nuremberg tribunal.98.	Viet Nam  a Member of the United Nations  sincerely hopes that peace and stability in South-East Asia will be achieved with the active participation of the United Nations. We do not at all want to have peace and stability restored in that region without the participation of the United Nations  or even less  over the opposition of a majority of the United Nations.99.	We do not oppose the United Nations. But there is certainly a problem  created by the United Nations itself  which is that the Organization recognizes the illegal Pol Pot clique and opposes the right to life of the more than half of the Khmer nation that managed to escape genocide. Moreover  virtually all the humanitarian assistance to Kampuchea has been going to the genocidal criminals  to help them sabotage the renaissance of the Kampuchean people.100.	That explains why all solutions in regard to Kampuchea undertaken so far within the framework of the United Nations must  paradoxically  be based on the premise of the legality of the criminal Pol Pot clique. If the United Nations persists in its current course  the question of peace and stability in South-East Asia will be resolved outside the framework of the Organization. That will not be a happy precedent for the United Nations; far from it. Let it be recalled in this respect that the first Indo-China war  and the second  were settled outside the United Nations. In any case  the three Indo- Chinese countries highly appreciate the role and personal contributions of the Secretary-General to the promotion of understanding among the countries of the region.10. Since the victory of the Russian Revolution  the world has witnessed the emergence of countries with differing social systems  and hundreds of countries have been freed from colonialism and have become independent. That is the law of historical development. Certain statesmen who are very fond of boasting loudly about freedom and diversity in their countries are nevertheless unable to accept diversity and freedom in the world. They would like to keep intact the old world order  and they use force towards that end.102. Hot wars  like the Second World War and the Viet Nam war  and cold wars such as those of the fifties  sixties and eighties are all powerless to thwart these historical developments. The gunboat policy of past centuries  which has become completely anachronistic  can lead only to failure. 103.	There is only one path â the peaceful coexistence of countries with differing social regimes  respect for the right of peoples to self-determination  and the peaceful settlement of differences on the basis of equality and mutual respect.104.	That is true of international problems as much as it is of regional problems. It is true also of the problems of South-East Asia."
"143",7424,"VUT",38,1983,"ï»¿89.	 Mr. President  I extend toyou and your country the warm congratulations andsincere best wishes of the Government and people ofVanuatu on your election to the high office of Presidentof the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Thispromises to be a most significant session and perhaps oneof the most critical international gatherings of modernhistory. We are confident that your leadership will beequal to the task and will reflect your many years ofdiplomatic experience and expertise  your careful andconsidered judgement and the courage and candour forwhich you and the Government and people of Panamaare noted.90.	Under your guidance we anticipate the same thoughtfulness and impartiality which our deliberations enjoyedduring the last session under the very capable leadershipof Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary. His also was a difficulttenure and one which earned the gratitude of the entireinternational community.91.	We also believe that congratulations are in order toanother outstanding diplomat  Mr. Davidson Hepburn the representative of the Bahamas. His candidacy forthe office of President of this year's General Assemblystrengthened the democratic process within the UnitedNations and was a visible and dignified expression of thevitality of the Organization's democracy. His candidacywas also important for two other reasons. First  he represents a country which  like ours  is a small isled developing State. Very often the particular difficulties andneeds of such States are overlooked within the international arena. Secondly  his country is in a sub region  theCaribbean  which like our own sub region  the SouthPacific is similarly often overlooked. It is our hope thatMr. Hepburn's candidacy will at last signal an awakeningto the fact that all nations  like all people  are createdequal.92.	Panama Is also a country small in size but great instature and reputation. Thus  this year's friendly contestfor the presidency of the General Assembly made winnerof us all. It afforded us the unique opportunity to choosebetween two highly qualified candidates from smash countries. For this reason we salute you both and say to youthat we will all be forever grateful.93.	We also congratulate the Government and peopleof Saint Christopher and Nevis  another small islanddeveloping into a  State  on their country's attainment of independence and on becoming the iS8th Member of theUnited Nations. Its presence in our midst strengthens theOrganization and its democracy and bears witness to theuniversality of mankind and this world body.94.	It is occasionally necessary to applaud and exercisein democracy here at the United Nations because somedo not always practise what they preach. There are thosewho espouse a belief in the dignity and quality of all?mankind and all nations yet ignore the smaller countriesuntil they seek our votes on a specific item. There arethose who profess a belief in freedom of expression yet theGeneral Assembly does not welcome the exercise of such freedom by smallerStates that may  on occasion  hold different positionsfrom those they have taken. There are those who like us believe in a free market of ideas. However  they doresent when the mood strikes them to close the market or force it to move elsewherebecause they do not always like the ideas being presented.95.	Obviously such thinking is not only irrational butalso painfully short-sighted and rather childish. For mankind  the United Nations is still a greatorganization  it is certainly not perfect. Nothing mankindhas yet created can claim that distinction. However  itis perhaps the best and most important institution we have?yet created. If we have the will it can be strengthened andmade better  but only if we have the will and if we respectand enhance its decisions and its democratic processes.96.	This is not to say that these critics do not come fromdemocratic societies. In fact  the irony is that their ownsocieties are in many ways models of democracy for theprotection of individual rights. We simply wish that theywould pause for a moment to reflect on the democraticideas of other societies  including those that stress theprotection of collective rights. Furthermore  we wish thateveryone would lend stronger support to the practice ofdemocracy than to the exercise of power in internationaldeliberations.97.	We in Vanuatu owe a great deal to the UnitedNations  as does every other nation that was a colony atthe close of the Second World War. Others who owe agreat deal to the United Nations include millions ofpersons who are no longer ravaged by hunger and diseaseor who have a place to sleep or who can read becauseof the work of the United Nations specialized agencies?Big nations and small nations owe a great deal to theOrganization because it has provided a universal forumfor discussion and exchange where there was none before.98.	Naturally  the United Nations cannot be given creditfor every advance mankind has made since 1945  but itcan certainly be credited with enough to make us all proud. Not the least of the world body's accomplishmentsis that it has brought us together from all corners of theglobe and made it somewhat easier for us to communicateto get to know each other  bridging unnatural gapsof suspicion and distrust. The United Nations cannot beNamed if we  the Members  have not taken full advantageof this opportunity.99.	We in Vanuatu are fortunate. Ours is a free andopen society  and we are situated in a region with neighbours who respect our tight to draw our own conclusionsand develop our country in our own fashion. We areits unique manner and its still unrealised potential. Oneof our fondest wishes is that people from other regionswill get to know and appreciate us and our region a littlehit more. For us  this session of the General Assemblyis an important step in that process100.	It is always a rare and unique privilege to addressthe General Assembly. This year the privilege is even rarerand more unique because of the presence of so manydistinguished heads of States or Government here at thisthirty-eighth sessions. Most have come in response to theappeal made at the Seventh Conference of Heads of Stateor Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at NewDelhi in March 1983  and the subsequent urging of thehighly esteemed chairperson of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  our good friend Mrs Indira Gandhi Prime Minister of India. All have come in recognitionof the fact that the United Nations  despite its shortcomings and its critics  continues to be the best  and perhapsthe last hope of mankind for our very survival on thisplanet. In no other forum are all of the peoples of theworld represented. In no other forum do representativesof the strong and the weak  the rich and the poor  theproud and the humble  the well-educated and the undereducated of the entire world sit together and in theory if not always in fact  work together for solutions to theproblems which threaten our very existence as a form oflife.102.	The attendance of so many world leaders at thisyear's session signifies a long-overdue recognition of theimportance of the Organization. We hope that it will alsosignify a renewed commitment on the part of all of itsMembers to the letter and to the spirit of the Charter.We hope too  that it will signify a firm determination totake seriously the admonition of our able Secretary-General  who  in his most recent report on the work of the Organization said  ""A continuous effortto contribute to the implementation of United Nationsdecisions should be an integral part of the foreign policyof Member States to a far greater extent than it is at thepresent time."" -103.	In his report  the Secretary-General has once againdemonstrated the candour and insightful analysis whichwe have come to expect of him and his excellent staff andwhich is so essential if we  the Members of the UnitedNations  are to take the necessary steps to strengthen theOrganization and make it more effective. We must remember that the failures and shortcomings of the UnitedNations are the failures and shortcomings of the membership. All of us  large and small  old and new  developed and developing  share this responsibility. Either Ishall make our work here meaningful and successful orwe shall by our own actions reduce it to meaninglessirrelevance and abstraction. The choice lies with us. Ourrespective peoples perceive the United Nations throughour actions and attach as much meaning to its pronouncements as we ourselves do.104.	No one can deny that the United Nations  andIndeed mankind  is at this very moment at one of thoseImportant and innumerable crossroads which recur in thecourse of human history. At this moment  we are facedwith daily reminders of how technology has figurativelyreduced the size of the globe and brought us all closertogether. Unfortunately  the very same technology hasfar too often fuelled  in some people  an uncontrollablegreed and desire to rule and control the resources of otherpeople. Thus  although we live in a world of great abundance  which is capable of producing even more  far toomany people live in a world of constant scarcity. Thisscarcity is not only a scarcity of material goods  whichwould be difficult enough to explain and cope with  but a scarcity of respect and of opportunity.105.	It is this tatter scarcity which is most distressingand most inexcusable as we stand poised on the brink ofthe twenty-first century  it is this scarcity more titan anyother factor which has been to the seemingly never-endingseries of global shockwaves and confrontations betweenthe world's ""haves"" and its ""have-nots"".106.	The world's super-Powers certainly have their owncontradictions and causes for conflict. However  it wouldbe a grievous error to attempt to define all of the worldspresent problems in terms of super-Power rivalry. Rivalries between States and even between social systems comeand go. However  the aspirations  goals and dreams of peopleâall people men  women and childrenâare constant. All want thesame thingsâ-a better life  understanding and respect.107.	Is there a better institution to address itself to theseaspirations and dreams than the United NationsWe think not. Can the United Nations do so with greatercharity and more effectiveness We think so. Should theworld community continue the investment it has alreadymade in the United Nations Without doubt. We believethat the United Nations has already given us all a favourable return and justified its existence many times over.108.	We must remember that the United Nations is anoutgrowth of the Second World War alliance against theAxis Powers. As such  the Organization represents aninternational alliance against fascism  militarism andracism.109.	It was never intended to be  and because of itsnature and the realities of our world it can never effectively be  an alliance against communism any more than it can  or even should  be an alliance against capitalism.The social and economic system that any country choosesto live under is a matter that is best left to the people ofthat country. This is true regardless of that country'sname  size or location  be it the United States or be itNicaragua.110.	The United Nations has been at its best in heapingto prevent another world war and in helping promote andaccelerate the process of decolonization. It has been a platform for the denunciation of one economic and social system by the proponents ofanother. Such crusades are best left to other bodies  asthey seriously hamper and undermine our effectiveness.It would be wise for all of us to remember thatthe world's two foremost Powers are both significantstronger than the rest of us. Neither one needs any ofus to fight its battles. However  the consequences of anysuch fight affects each and every one of us. Therefore we have as much of an interest in the rational and reasonable exercise of the tremendous power possessed bythese two great nations as they themselves do.112. Our search  therefore  must be for some commonground or common denominator on which they and wecan continue our quest for peace  development and survival. Let our children decide the future  but let us ensurethat there will be a future11. In assessing the current state of the United Nations one is reminded of the story of the two Individuals who upon looking at the same glass of water  had differentobservations. One  the pessimist  observed that the glasswas half empty. The other  the optimist  observed thatthe glass was half full. That story applies to any assessment of the United Nations and of world affairs. Yes  there are vexing problems which plague theacted and seem as If they will never be resolved. IN South Africa and the Middle East a pervasive patternof attitudinal and militarised racism has bequeathed a legacy ofintercommunal  strife which at times appears to be immune except by force of arms. In South-East Asia morethan four decades of ceaseless and unremitting warfareand destruction have left the people and their and devastated. In South and Central America  the just and legitimate strivings of people for justice  equality  land  breadand freedom have been labelled subversive by the despotswho rule every facet of their lives. Fascistic death squadsoperate with impunity and include among their victimsdefenceless peasants  priests  nuns  teachers and schoolchildren. In the South Pacific  we find most of the worldsremaining non-self-governing territories  and we find thepart of this world that has faced the greatest exposureto nuclear tests  with little regard for the safety of humanbeings and the environment.In reaction to those conditions of poverty  disease and illiteracy they havebeen forced to endure  the peoples of Africa  Asia andSouth and central America and the Caribbean havethemselves begun the process of changing the conditionsof their lives. Naturally  the various peoples of the SouthPacific is also an integral part of this process of change.It should also came as no surprise that a great manypeople from the developed world are also part of thisprocess of change. Some of them share in our history andhave themselves been cruelty exploited. All of them shareour vision of the future.At times this process of change has moved forwardquietly and almost imperceptibly. At other times it hasproceeded dramatically with a mighty roar and greatturbulence. In most instances the manner in which theprocess proceeded was determined by those who soughtto abort the process of change. ""Power concedes notingwithout a demand "" observed Frederick Douglass. ""Itnever did  and it never will "" said that great son of Africa who with his people helped end legal slavery in the UnitedStates over 100 years ago. Today his words are as prophetic and as meaningful as they were then:""If there is no struggle  there is no progress. Thosewho profess to favour freedom  yet deprecate agitationare men who want crops without ploughing up theground. They want rain without thunder and lightning.They want the ocean without the awful roar of its manywaters.""Those words should be borne in mind during our deliberations  particularly on those items which seem to remainon our agenda with no apparent solution in sight.118.	After so many years  it is not easy to understandwhy the people of Palestine cannot return to their homes.It is difficult to comprehend why South Africa must begiven even more inducements to end its illegal occupationof Namibia. It is difficult to fathom how rational mindscan treat the neo-fascist regime in Pretoria like a civilizednation  which it is not  rather than like the outcast andpariah which it is.119.	Some have suggested that we  the internationalcommunity  have not been patient enough or that we arenot moderate enough in considering these issues and Inframing resolutions on these topics. Others argue quiteconvincingly that we have already been too patient andthat we have no right to be any more moderate than wehave been. After all  they say  how patient and howmoderate was the international community four decadesago in the face of the same fascism  the same militarismand the same racism that we are counselled to be topatient with and so moderate towards today120.	Perhaps there is an argument that can be made fortoning down some of these resolutions. We do not know.We simply know that we have not yet heard valid reasonsfor voting against resolutions that seek to redress validgrievances.121. It seems to us that those with publicity proclaim anintention to embrace South Africa must themselves acceptresponsibility for resolutions which criticize such anembrace. To do otherwise is to suggest that some of usare above criticism  and certainty our Creator neverintended that any of us think that of ourselves. Thatwould be the height of arrogance and would undoubtedlybring down the indignation and the wrath of the Creator.122. The situations in title Middle East and in southernAfrica is indeed tragic. They are tragic for the victimswho live in those areas and tragic for us  all of mankind as well.123.	For the victims  the people of those areas  ourprimary feelings are not feelings of pity  sympathy  soar-row or pessimism. Towards them  our primary feelingsare feelings of support  solidarity  encouragement andoptimism. To them we are grateful  for they renew in allof us the very best of human qualities. Our pity  oursympathy and our sorrow are reserved for those peoplewho choose to remain on the side-lines  passively accepting  or for those who tragically imitate Israeland South Africa in other regions.124.	Indonesia is a country which we have long admiredand respected. It is a country which by its actions helpedinspire the decolonization process and tater became afounder of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Itis a large and powerful country which we consider afriend.125.	Although Vanuatu is Indonesia's friend  we alsorealize that a true friend is not one who tells anothersimply what he wishes to hear. Difficult as It may be  atrue friend must on occasion be painfully honest and tella friend what that friend may not wish to hear. Such isthe case with respect to Indonesia's Invasion  occupationand attempted annexation of East Timor.126.	East Timor is another small South Pacific country like our own. Its people fought on the side of the Alliesduring the Second World War and paid dearly for theircommitment to what became the Ideals of the UnitedNations. Like more than two thirds of the nations represented here today  the people of East Timor saw the post-war era as the time to re-assert their own political andsocial independence. Tragically  Indonesia's militaryrulers interrupted East Timor's decolonization process asthat process was in its final stages.127.	The resulting brutalization of East Timor's peoplehas also brutalized Indonesia's image as a nation. Howcan one so large justify such heavy-handed repression ofa small neighbour. Hundreds of thousands of Innocent men women and children had to nay with their lives and somany mote are still paying of sudden disappearances detention without explanation  and torture. Why hasevery effort to provide even the minimum humanitarianassistance to the beleaguered people of East Timor beenthwarted by the Indonesian authorities?Certainly  no rational person would suggest thatthere is an acceptable double standard on questions ofcolonization  colonialism and human rights. Where is it written that colonialism is wrong only when the colonial Power Is a European nation?  Where is it written that thesystematic denial of fundamental human rights  includingthe very right to life itself  is evil only when the violatorhappens to be a European nation?129.	If we accept Indonesia's actions in East Timor then with what legal authority do we challenge Israel'sannexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights?  If weaccept Indonesia's brutality in East Timor  then with whatmoral authority do we challenge apartheid?  If we  theformer colonies of the world are not true to our ownpronouncements on colonialism and human rights whenit comes to East Timor  then we have not yet reed ourselves from the old discredited values of those who called themselves our masters.130.	It is not easy  nor is it a pleasant experience  tobe compelled to focus so critically upon the actions ofa country which was once a mode and an inspiration toour Own people and others who were colonized. It is however  more difficult and less pleasant to bear witnessto what has been done to the people of East Timor. Itis also difficult to comprehend the more bankruptcy ofthose who speak so eloquently on other matters  but whoremain silent on the question of East Timor.131.	We as a nation are not cynical enough to haveinterests which would lead us to close our eyes to theinjustices imposed on our fetor human beings in EastTimor. Were we to acquiesce in Indonesia's actions  wewould not be true to the Charter of the United Nationsnor to ourselves  or to our children and the future wewould bequeath to them.132.	We are reminded of an important directive issuedduring the struggle to free Guinea-Bissau and Cape Vergefrom colonial domination: ""Hide nothing from themasses of the people. Tell no ties  claim no easy victories."" Those words are as appropriate here In this chamber today as they were in West Africa in 1968.133.	We  therefore  once again appeal to Indonesia tosave its soul as a nation and to be true to its heritageand stature by negotiating a speedy and complete withdrawal of its forces from East Timor. Let the people ofthat country decides their own fate  and let the UnitedNations assist in that process. This is why we have aUnited Nations.134.	New Caledonia is another non-self-governing territory in the South Pacific and another example of whywe have the Organization. It is also another matter whichcoils for us  the International community  to ""tell no lies claim no victories"".135.	New Caledonia is the world's second largest producer of niece. Therefore  the struggle by Its people togain their independence has posed and undoubtedly willcontinue to pose a second question: who will control theenormous economic potential of this small developingcountry136.	Without a doubt  all of us here today are wellaware of the role that economics played In the colonization of most of the world. We are also certainly awareof the fact that it is the mineral wealth of Namibia andof South Africa that lies behind the complicated politicalweb spun by those who do not wish to see the people ofthose countries control their own resources. New Caledonia's people face similar obstacles for the same reasons.137.	In New Caledonia  as In southern Africa  the settlerpopulation usually acts contrary to the Interests of theindigenous population. This the world understands andhas come to expect.138.	What is less well understood  however  Is that thesettler population  having its own narrow and specificInterests to protect  often acts contrary as well to thebroader Interests of the metropolitan Power. Such became the ease in Algeria and in Zimbabwe; such Is thecase in Namibia and In South Africa; and such is the easein New Caledonia.139.	Generally speaking  metropolitan Powers do nothave a direct interest in the maintenance of rigid andexclusionary social codes which hamper economic growthand development. This is particularly true when thosesocial codes  by whatever name they are called  are operable far from the physical environs of the metropolitan Power. Thus  apartheid  or segregation  comes to be seenas outmoded  unnecessary and even threatening to thebroader  more general economic interests of the metropolitan Power. Eventually  the metropolitan Power may for its own purposes  even seek to appear to be payinga leading role in ending a particularly odious social code.140.	Naturally  none of this occurs overnight. It takestime for the contradiction to arise  more time for it tobe recognized  art even mere time for the effort toreconcile it to be put into operation  in the meantime those who have been victims of the social code usuallyhave begun their own process of change. Generality speaking  wit they have in mind is a more far-reaching andfundamental change.The metropolitan Power then faces a dilemma. Onthe one hand  it is in a sense captive to a restive andobstinate stir population. On the other hand  it finallyreaches toast its tong-term interests are best served bymaking a more reasonable and rational accommodationwith the indigenous population. its main preoccupationnow becomes how to buy itself sufficient time to makethe necessary accommodation and how to balance thecompeting antagonisms of the settlers and the indigenouspopulation.142.	In this respect New Caledonia differs from SouthAfrica primarily in the nature of the metropolitan Power.South Africa no longer has one easily identifiable metropolitan Power. France  on the other hand  is dearlythe identifiable metropolitan Power which both the setters and the indigenous population now petition.143.	New Caledonia is similar to South Africa in thehardened racial attitudes of some of its European settlers.To them  the indigenous Kayak population is not worthyof the basic and elementary dignity  respect and legal rights that most human beings are now able to take forgranted.  The people of New Caledonia have extended awarm and open hand of friendship to all who would worktogether in a free and independent nation. Theirs is avision of a non-exclusionary South Pacific nation inwhich all human beings would be treated as equals.145.	We believe that the Government of France is sincerely searching for answers to the questions raised concerning New Caledonia's future. The reforms that Francehas introduced have certainty helped  and they demonstrate a sincere commitment to an effort to and somecommon ground upon which the competing interests maybe framed.The South Pacific Forum  at its meeting at Canberra on 29 and 30 August  took note of France's effortsin this regard. However  we  the South Pacific heads ofGovernment  also declared our support for independence for New Caledonia  and we urged the Frenchto consider  in conducting an act of self-determination  the desirability of excluding from theshort-term or non-permanent residents of NewCaledonia. This is in recognition of the fact that to bethe exercise of self-determination must be by theof a particular country themselves  and those whohave not even lived there but have been brought thereand permitted to vote m order to outweigh the wishes ofthe legitimate population must not take part  in its totality  the Canberra communiquÃ© supports the right of self-determination. It urges the various sectors of the nation to work closely with France to ensure a peaceful transition to independence. It is laudable in its aims andpractical it its approach  including the decision to reviewthe situation next year and to consider the desirability ofre-inscription of New Caledonia on the United Nationslist of non-self-governing territories.147. The Vanuatu Government is confident that NewCaledonia will soon  assume its rightful place as an independent nation. Toward that end  we urge Members of the United Nations to keep themselves apprised ofthe situation in this economically important tend and tosupport the initiatives of New Caledonia's people  as havethe Governments of the South Pacific.148.	We in the South Pacific have another major preoccupation  in addition to our concern for the remainingnon-self-covering territories in our area. All our Governments  including those of Australia and New Zealand have taken strong stands against nuclear testing in ourarea.149.	The peoples of the Pacific have always respectedand been at peace with their environment. To us  ourlands  our skies and our ocean have always been a sourceof spiritual guidance as we as a means of sustaining life. Others have now come to our area to conduct tests store material and dump wastes that would not be tolerated in their own waters and on their own tends. Despitethe strong representation of all Governments in the area this reckless disregard for human life and the environmentcontinues almost unabated. Our opposition is based onmoral as well as scientific grounds  invitations by Franceor by any other nuclear Power to visit test sites wit neverreduce the strength of our moral objections. We  thepeople of the South Pacific  have made it clear that wewant an immediate end to the testing of any and ailnuclear weapons in our region.It is for this reason that our Government supportsproposals for the establishment of a nuclear-free Pacific.This past July we were proud to host an internationalconference on a nuclear-free and independent Pacific. Toall but the most myopic observer  it is clear that the twogo hand in hand; indeed  we submit that it will in factbe difficult to achieve a nuclear-free Pacific until thereis an independent Pacific and until the respective peoplesof the area are free to decide for themselves whether thisdefilement of our land  sea and air shall continue.152. Economic development in the South Pacific is adifficult and somewhat elusive goal. Some of our count-tries are blessed with abundant mineral resources  seemwith abundant agricultural resources  and others withneither. Most are under populated. All are separated bymany miles of ocean  mass communications and transportation are major problems. Finally  this latter character: exacerbates our present state of underdevelopmentand preoccupies us all.For these reasons  the United Nations Conventionon the Law of the Sea is so important. It is ourhope that someday this Convention will be acclaimed and unanimously accepted  as it has alreadybeen by an overwhelming majority of our neighbour.Being a stall island State ourselves  we supportthe concerns of other such States that their territorialintegrity be respected and preserved. We too have aterritorial dispute with a major Power. We hope thatFrance will in good faith negotiate an acceptwith us and that the islands of Matthew and Hunter willonce again be administered as part of our country  whichthey are.Both the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries andthe United Nations have begun to focus on the uniqueproblems of small island developing States. The recentlyconcluded conference of experts hosted by the Government of Grenada is a very positive step in the right direction. it is our hope that the work of the conference cancontinue and deceive the support of the entire international community.156. We recognize that the problems of small Islandsdeveloping States are only one of a host of economicproblems plaguing the world today. The depressed stateof the world economy  with the universal phenomenonof international inflationary pressures  is a major concern The need for international monetary reform andthe expansion of international trade is well documented.The twin needs of greater North-South dialogue andgreater South-South economic trade and co-operation arealso well known. So many major economic problemsconfront us today that one hardly knows where and howto begin cataloguing them.157.	The resolution of these problems is going to necessitate a serious and long-term commitment by each of us.Perhaps it will be painful  but we should probably beginwith critical self-examinations of our respective histories policies and priorities.158.	None of us is perfect  large or small  developedor developing. Those who pontificate and preach to usthat we must follow the same path of development thatthey followed understand neither history nor economics.The world is different today from what it was 200 yearsago  or even 20 years ago  and our objective conditionsare certainly different. Modern technology has renderedobsolete much of what we learned and have dramaticallyincreased the gap between those nations which ""have""and those which ""have not"".159.	No nation today has the luxury of developing inisolation  at its own pace. Radio  films  television  books newspapers and magazines all bring the affluent worldto the attention of the citizens of all countries. Very fewGovernments exist today which can resist the attendantpressures to bring that or a comparable good life to itsown citizens.160.	Wealth that was created  at least in part  as a directconsequence of legalized slavery  colonialism and thetheft of other people's natural resources is inaccuratelyportrayed as resulting solely from the hard work andnatural intelligence of those who came to possess thatwealth.161.	It is not at all possible or even desirable for us todevelop our countries by rigid imitations of the West orthe East. We cannot isolate ourselves  but we most certainly can develop our own methodology and our ownhealthy economy and social mix. We certainly do not havethe option of salting to distant shores and stealing landor having people to labour for us. as others have in thepast. Even if that option were available  it is not the waywe would choose to develop. While we do not live in thepast  we most certainly remember our shared history.162.	This is not to suggest for one moment that thingstoday are as one-sided as we might like to believe. We the developing countries are also imperfect. Some of ushave neglected to practise what we preached. Some areafraid to be candid in assessing our own performances as if our adversaries and friends did not already knowwhere we have fallen short. Some continue to makecapital mistakes; others among us continue tic make sodamistakes. Some manage to make both.163.	For us to begin to take corrective action  we mustfirst be true to ourselves. For us to be taken seriously we must first take ourselves seriously. We will undoubtedly command as much respect as we demand by our ownefforts  our own consistency and  most importantly  ourown sacrifices  personal and institutional164.	Now more than ever we must respect the universality of mankind and plan for the future. There areliterally dozens of pressing problems confronting theinternational community today. Bach successive crisisseems to overshadow the previous one.165.	Perhaps none in recent memory was as dramaticas the downing of the Korean Air Lines flight 007. Fewincidents have captured the public's attention as that did.Few incidents have as dramatically pointed to the needfor better communication and understanding and for thestrengthening of the United Nations. There is no doubtthat 269 people lost their lives needlessly. This in itselfis a great human tragedy  and we convey our very deepestcondolences to the families and friends of the victims.166.	We do not know if the world will ever know whatevents really led up to this tragedy and what really happened just before the aircraft was shot down. It Is possiblethat both sides are telling the truth as they perceive thetruth to be. We do not know.167.	We do not believe there can ever be any justification for shooting down a civilian aircraft  except perhapsin the extremely remote possibility of averting a fargreater immediate human disaster. We believe that theSoviet Union made a tragic mistake and inexplicablycompounded the mistake in its immediate aftermath.168.	However  we do not believe that blame or guilt inthis instance lies with any one nation. This was a tragedyfor all mankind and not just for any one State or groupof States  it proves nothing about any particular socialor economic system. This was a failure by mankind  allmankind  it reveals the heightened sense of internationalinsecurity that the arms race  cold war rhetoric and testsof military preparedness have brought us.169.	This tragedy tells us that the technology of destruction is far more advanced than is the technology ofcommunication and the technology of the prevention ofdestruction. n the normal course of events  we wouldlearn from such a tragedy and develop more effectivesafeguards to prevent a recurrence. Unfortunately thisdoes not appear to be the ease  and this is even more ofa tragedy.170.	It saddens and concerns us to see the internationalatmosphere further poisoned by hatred and recriminate-tons. Now more than ever  the world cries out for theleadership of wise statement. Where are the leaders withthe wisdom and the courage to say  ""Let us sit down andreason together""  to say  ""Let us make sure this doesnot happen again""  to say  ""Let us put an end to thesuspicions and distrust which gave rise to this incident""17. Why are those who were silent when a Libyanairliner was shot down by Israeli fighters so vocal andarticulate now Why are those who were silent when aCuban airliner was blown out of the sky by a terroristbomb so morally outraged now All human life is sacred and none is more sacred than another. The lives of EastTimorese and Vietnamese are sacred. The lives of Pays-Tinianâs and Lebanese are sacred. The lives of Iranians and[raise are sacred. The lives of Chileans and Filipinos aresacred. The lives of Cypriots and Guatemalans are sacred.Without exception the loss of any human life is a tragedy.The number of victims or their nationality does not makethe tragedy any worse or deepen our sorrow. Those whostress the individual aspects of human rights shouldunderstand this better than anyone.172.	Why are those who are so willing to isolate theSoviet Union so unwilling to isolate South Africa Whyis it vital to keep channels of communication open toSouth Africa  but not to the Soviet Union Why is SouthAfrica considered a civilized State  but not the SovietUnion173.	Ours is a smelt country  and admittedly we do notknow the answer to every question. However  there aremany things we are certain of. One certainty is that thosewho ally themselves with the evil practitioners of apartheidor other forms of racism cannot complain to us whenothers move into the moral vacuum they themselves havecreated. To them we say ""If we are to believe in yourmoral superiority  it is time for you to demonstrate it insouthern Africa  in East Timor  in the Middle East  incentral America and in other parts of our troubledglobe"".174. For emphasis  we wit repeat and stress again andagain that both the Soviet Union and the United Statesare very big and very powerful countries. Neither needVanuatu or any other country to fight its betties  andcertainty not the battle between these two giants. However. as human beings  we have a great deal at stake.75. We do not want these two great Powers to fightunless they limit their weapons to their respective moraystrengths and their powers of persuasion. We have asmuch to lose as they do  should tidy insist on fightingwith military weapons. We cannot stop them  but we canand do try to urge caution and restraint. The only weapons we have at our disposal are truth  our faith inmankind and our own powers of pet suasion. 76. We now papacy to either country to step forwardand  in the name of humanity  say ""We have all hadenough of this madness"". Let one begin by dismantlingone weapon and it the other folio suit by dismantlinganother. Which one begins the process is no longer important  just as which one began to stockpile the weaponsis no longer important.The people of both the Soviet Union and theUnited States  along with the people of many othercountries  made tremendous sacrifices four decades agowhich led to the creation of the United Nations. Now itis time for one more enormous sacrifice It is still not toolate.178.	The entire world is waiting for us  all of us  tomove forward in the name of the human race. Now eachnation represented here today must ask itself whether itwishes to be part of the problem or to be part of thesolution. "
"144",7459,"WSM",38,1983,"ï»¿2.	 Mr. President  my delegation extends its congratulations to you on your election to your high office. We feel sure that under your guidance the burdens of this session will seem lighter.3.	We would like to pay a tribute to Mr. Imre Hollai for the patience and skill with which he conducted the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly.4.	We are also grateful to the Secretary-General for his untiring devotion to his duties and his dedication to the aims and principles of the United Nations. His vision and his unflagging determination to set the Organization on the right course are an inspiration to us. Indeed  we feel that Ms warnings  which are pertinent and entirely appropriate  must be heeded.5.	We are very pleased to welcome our newest United Nations neighbour  Saint Christopher and Nevis  into this forum. We are always delighted to have other small island developing countries like ourselves join us here  and we look forward to working with its delegation both here and in other forums  including those of the Commonwealth.6.	We hope that it may not be too much longer before we are also able to welcome a new regional neighbour  should this be its wish; I speak of New Caledonia. We are encouraged by the French Government's intention to move the Territory to an act of self-determination and we  along with the other members of the South Pacific Forum  are anxious to see progress achieved in accordance with the wishes of the people of New Caledonia. We feel that the peaceful movement of New Caledonia towards the achievement of her people's aspirations will help maintain the peace and stability we enjoy in our region.7.	Not that far from our shores  however  in the South and South-East Asian regions  two serious threats to the stability of the entire region continue to endanger peace. In Kampuchea the Vietnamese occupation is in its fifth year  and armed conflict within that country and along its borders continues. We are deeply concerned for the people of Kampuchea  both those within the borders  who have suffered so long from various forms of persecution and domination  and those who have fled the horrors and are now refugees. We support the efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations to achieve an international solution to this problem with the removalof all foreign forces and the coming together of all parties at the negotiating table so that the wishes of the people themselves may finally be taken into account.8.	In Afghanistan  the withdrawal of foreign forces is also an essential first step on the road to a solution. Here too our chief concern is for the people of Afghanistan  many of whom have been uprooted or made homeless  adding to the world's refugee population and placing a great burden on the countries to which these poor souls have fled. We applaud the Secretary-General's continuing efforts towards a negotiated settlement and are pleased that he feels encouraged in his efforts and hopeful that progress is possible.9.	We are pleased that there are some glimmers of hope on the world's horizons at a time when there is a tendency to pessimism regarding international relations and the role of the United Nations in them. We must not give in or let our efforts waver  but embrace hope and determine to make greater efforts. This Organization  in its uniqueness  has a great responsibility to the peoples of the world. It is entrusted by them to deal with problems  however difficult they may be  in the most calm and rational manner possible. We must not therefore engage in empty rhetoric  sidestep vital issues  play games of strategy and carry out other unproductive activities which only waste our time  or perhaps that of the world itself. We have so many urgent problems facing us that practical problem- solving is the only course left to us.10.	The Secretary-General's recent trip to southern Africa has encouraged us to hope that the long-sought independence of Namibia may not be too far off. Substantial practice progress has been made regarding the independence process  and virtually all outstanding issues regarding the machinery to implement the United Nations plan have been resolved. What is now required is the political will on the part of South Africa  and this entails dropping the linkage of Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola with Namibian independence. We are anxious to see the people of Namibia have their day at the United Nations  have supervised elections and finally achieve their aspirations. We feel that efforts cannot be relaxed but must in fact be doubled until a date is set for this.11.	South Africa continues to defy the world with itspolicies. These gross injustices and this denial of human rights and dignity cannot be allowed. South Africa must be made to see that it cannot continue to deny the basic principles of human decency.12.	The Middle East tragically still demands our attention; indeed  its problems consume a good deal of the Organization's time and have done so since its inception. Here it is imperative that rationality should prevail and that all parties to this dispute should eschew bitterness and retaliation and take positive and practical steps to a comprehensive solution. United Nations guidelines are clear: Israel has a right to exist  but so do the Palestinians have rights  and a homeland must be considered one of them. The Jewish people suffered hard and long in their quest for a homeland. So who should understand better than they the longing arid desperation of another people for theirs and not begrudge it to them? Equally  however the Palestinians must understand Israelâs wish for security and accept its existence within secure borders. Both sides must compromise and not reject out of hand the plans put to them. Surely  if only with very small incremental steps  progress can be made. Israel  to show its good faith  must cease its settlements policy in the occupied territories. On the other hand  the Palestinians and their allies must guarantee Israel its existence free from threat.	13.	Lebanon's tragedy still seems a long way from solution. This sadly shattered land must be enabled to get its house in orderâa house that has been so terribly divided against itself that much patience and practical assistance are required from the world community to assist it in these efforts. Perhaps more importantly  the mischievous meddling that has too long fuelled the factional friction must cease. This is essential so Lebanon can make unhindered efforts at recovery and rehabilitation and at the reconciliation of its bitterly divided citizens.14.	The war between Iran and Iraq not only is adversely affecting the welfare of these two previously prosperous and productive countries but  with the massive oil pollution spilling into the sea from the untended oil wells in the battlefields  is disrupting and possibly destroying the ecology of a large part of the Gulf region. Thus this war is literally spilling over into areas which have no direct part in the conflict  and its effects are being felt not only in Iran and Iraq but by innocent countries  people and wildlife. This points up the futility of any suggestions that the effects of war can be contained. In today's world  neighbours who quarrel must realize that their resort to violence to settle their disputes causes suffering not only to their own peoples but often to others in the vicinity. None of us are aloneâeven the most isolated of usâ and we must accept the fact that the welfare of the entire world  in all its ecological fragility and with the vulnerability of its peoples  is the responsibility of every Government.15.	In the light of that  our concern continues over the effects of nuclear testing in the Pacific. The South Pacific Forum  at its recent regional meeting  reiterated its strong opposition to nuclear testing and proposals for storing and dumping nuclear waste materials in the Pacific. Though we welcome the French Government's decision to invite scientists from the region to visit and assess the situation at the testing sites at Mururoa Atoll  we are afraid that much irreversible damage may have already been done to the environment to which we turn for most of our needs and that future generations may suffer effects of which we are not as yet even aware. The comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty therefore seems to us an essential tool for the survival of our species. We note that there have been over 1300 test detonations since 1945  and we ask the question: why should we and others with no interest in nuclear-weapon superiority suffer for this exercise in futility?16.	This points up again our inescapable interdependence and the concern one must have for the welfare of all on this Earth if we are ultimately to survive. We may once have felt safe and secure in isolation but this is no longer the case  and disarmament  even for countries with no defence forces  must be an issue of vital concern.17.	From our perspective the arms race  particularly the nuclear arms race  is quite pointless. We realize however  that for any practical progress to be made in disarmament we must begin with small steps which the major Powers will accept. While the climate has not been promising for progress  we are pleased to gee that some small headway has been made in the Geneva negotiations on reducing medium-range missiles in Europe. If there is any hope of breaking through major barriers we urge the Soviet Union and the United States to do so  bearing in mind the urgency of these negotiations. We applaud the concessions  however small  that might move these and the equally important strategic arms reduction talks forward. The recent meeting  at Madrid  of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe may have been overshadowed by tensions resulting from the dreadful destruction of the Korean civilian aircraft. This heinous act  whatever its full background might be  must not be allowed to stand in the way of world peace. We hope that confidence-building measures already adopted will not be jeopardized but will be further built on in the future.18.	While the major onus for de-escalation of the arms race must be on the major Powers  we must not be blind to the acceleration in the arms build-up in so many other countries  including many third world countries which can ill afford it. We appeal to them to put the important priorities of the health and welfare of their populations before armaments. The spread of nuclear arms to many countries is a source of great concern to us  and we see the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as the main bulwark against this spread. We feel that setting up nuclear-free zones is also an important measure  and we strongly support setting up such a zone in the South Pacific.19.	In our quest for peace we must not forget that peace and development are inseparable. A stable economic future is essential for political stability  and with the increasing economic interdependence of the world the reality is clear. The well-being of both developed and developing countries is inextricably linked. It is interesting to note that the developing countries receive 40 per cent of all United States exports. While the industrialized countries  in the communiquÃ© issued after their summit meeting at Williamsburg in May 1983  acknowledged that the weight of the recession had fallen heavily on developing countries  they suggested no new solutions to the third world's problems. There were commitments to stop protectionism and to work toward a greater convergence of economic performance and affirmation of the obligation of the industrialized countries to fund the International Development Association. While these goals are all admirable in themselves  they are nevertheless piecemeal measures. The global economic crisis requires  as called for by the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  a programme of concerted measures for reactivating the global economy and for accelerated and substantial growth in the developing countries. There was a consensus of all countries presentâwith the exception of oneâthat this was essential.20.	It is therefore almost universally recognized that the development process must not be allowed to grind to a complete halt  a prospect too real in recent times  and while it is apparent  too  that a higher level of growth is required in the industrialized countries  it is also clear that these two aims are complementary. It is once again essential that the world work together. Unilateral action  as the Secretary-General points out in his report on the work of the Organization  without regard for its effects on others  will inevitably lead to a further weakening of the world economic situation.21.	It is a source of some sadness to us that though the developing countries have shown flexibility and a willingness to compromise in the interests of a constructive and practical approach to the global negotiations to try to meet the concerns of the developed countries  a corresponding response is not forthcoming. The two-phase approach which would allow the most urgent matters and those more amenable to solution to be negotiated first seems a not unreasonable way to begin to bring about the changes the world economy requires.22.	Although the economic situation of the world may still be rather grim  here too at least there is some light on the horizon. There does seem to be an upturn in some countries' economies  and for quite a few the picture is not as dark as it was some months ago. We hope this may presage a genuine turn upwards in the world's economic situation and that every effort will be made to maximize any benefits for all.23.	We acknowledge  as did the Secretary-General and the President in their statements  that the true picture of the world at the moment is a very painful one  and if we review the broad human rights situation in any detail it becomes even more distressing. There is much in this area that we R3K? address. Indeed  it is an important duty of the organization to work towards the restoration of the basic human rights of the many who have been deprived of them. Despite our recognition of the harsh realities  we are confident that things can and will be improved. Hope  courage and patience are needed now perhaps more than at any time in the past  and with faith in the human spirit and in God  we can bring about the results that the world has every right to expect of us.

"145",7499,"YEM",38,1983,"ï»¿52.	Allow me at the outset to express to you  Sir  the warm congratulations of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic and myself on your election to the presidency of this session. I am confident of your ability to carry out the great task which has been entrusted to you  for your political expertise and wisdom are well-known.53.	I wish also to express our appreciation and thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai  who fulfilled his responsibilities brilliantly. I cannot fail to pay a tribute to the valuable and unstinting efforts made by the Secretary-General in the service of the Organization and its purposes. He has been discharging his complex duties with great skill and ability  and we wish him continued success.54.	My delegation and I are pleased to welcome Saint Christopher and Nevis to membership in the international Organization.55.	Each year when we ascend this rostrum we are filled with hope that we will be able to realize many of our aspirations for justice  stability and prosperity before the following session. Most regrettably  however  realities limit our legitimate aspirations to the realm of mere thinking and optimism.56.	The present international situation is grave  characterized by proliferating hotbeds of tension brought about by recourse to force in the settlement of international disputes and by the escalation of the cold war between the two super-Powers  with its attendant feverish and frightening arms race.57.	These developments constitute a retreat from the provisions and norms of international law  but at the same time they serve to emphasize the importance of the role of the United Nations and its growing value as the best framework for dialogue and discussion aimed at resolving the problems which affect the prosperity  security and stability of our peoples. When we review our individual and common concerns in these periodic meetings  we are reaffirming the soundness of the philosophy which serves as the foundation of the Organization  and we are embodying the firm desire of our peoples to achieve greater understanding and co-operation in our world which is marked both by growing interdependence and a diversity of outlook.58.	There is no doubt that the Organization's prestige will be tested severely if the United Nations is limited merely to adopting resolutions and recommendations without possessing the means to implement them.59.	My country esteems highly the numerous achievements of the United Nations in various fields  and it also realizes the importance of the role of the Organization in the present international circumstances.60.	We wish to express our support for the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [%%?.] in its entirety and for the stress it lays on enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations through co-operation among its bodies and Members  so that it will be enabled to play its role for maintaining and consolidating the peace that we seek and the justice we desire and the prosperity we are to achieve.61.	The question of the Palestinian people has been for more than three decades a blow to man's ethics and ideals  and it continues to be so. The situation in the Middle East is an embodiment of the ever-widening gap between our goals and aspirations on the one hand and the painful reality of international relations on the other hand.. There we see Israel escalating its aggression against the Arab States and occupying part of Lebanon by force  thanks to its having found in one of the super-Powers an ally which stands behind its aggressive expansionist designs and protects it from all international pressure and sanctions for its unceasing crimes.62.	The present design to divide Lebanon is but one in a series in the unceasing Zionist plot against the integrity and future of the Arab nation. The clear role now being played by the United States in support of Israel in the implementation of this aggressive design provides ample evidence that the Zionist invasion of Lebanon would not have happened without co-ordination with the White House and would not have continued had not the United States desired that it should.63.	While the Tel Aviv Government has decided to occupy the southern part of Lebanon without regard for international laws and norms or for the resolutions of this Organization  the intervention by force of the United States of America in the internal conflict in this helpless State in support of one part of its population against another represents  in our view  a serious development in the policy of Washington in the area  the consequences and implications of which should not be underestimated either for the security of the area or for the relationship between the United States and the States of the area.64.	It is clear that the United States is now moving from the position of supporter of Israel in its aggressive and expansionist approach to that of ally and accomplice in all the actions of the Zionist State. This is in complete contradiction with the responsibility of the United States as a permanent member of the Security Council and in direct opposition to the wider interests of Washington in the region.65.	We in the Yemen Arab Republic view with profound concern this position taken by the United States. We call on the American Administration to reconsider the strategic alliance that exists at present with the racist Tel Aviv Government  and to stop the unconditional military  economic and diplomatic support for that Government that has always played a major role in the implementation of the aggressive Zionist design.66.	We also call for the immediate  complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territory in implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. We proclaim our full support for the Lebanese people  which has displayed such steadfastness in resisting occupation and any agreement with the Zionist enemy that is detrimental to its sovereignty and independence  harms the security and stability of any Arab country  limits the role of Arab Lebanon and compromises its national commitments  as set forth in the relevant instruments  treaties and resolutions of +he Arab summit.67.	No one can doubt that the tragic situation in Lebanon and the emergence of other hotbeds of tensionin the area are but ramifications and side-effects of the lain question  that of Palestine  which is the core of what is known as the question of the Middle East.68.	The increasing Israeli aggressive expansion in the area confirms something we realized long ago and have warned against on more than one occasion  that the Zionist entity  in view of its aggressive and expansionist nature and the racist mentality of its leaders  represents the most serious source of tension and aggression in the area.69.	Experience proves this  because Israel has waged a succession of aggressive wars against its neighbours on the pretext of protecting the 1948 frontiers. Having occupied the remainder of Palestine by force in 1967  its forces last year ravaged Lebanon  in order to divert international public opinion from the reality of the Zionist occupation of the Palestinian territories and the Syrian Golan Heights to a new situation whereby Israel would be able to achieve its expansionist ambitions and impose its hegemony on the whole area.70.	Things have gone so far that the leaders of Tel Aviv can publicly state their intention to annex the West Bank and Gaza. This is because of the absolute support given by the United States to guarantee Israeli military superiority in the region.71.	There has recently been a stepping up of Israel's arbitrary practices against the population of the occupied Arab territories  where crimes of murder  torture  mass detention and confiscation of property are committed by the occupying forces with a view to depopulating those territories and establishing more Zionist settlements therein.72.	It is indeed regrettable that the United States recently opposed a draft resolution  otherwise unanimously accepted by the members of the Security Council  confirming the illegality of the Israeli settler practices in the Arab occupied territories. This demonstrates a blind bias in favour of the aggressive Tel Aviv Government which is in contradiction with the moral and political responsibilities of the United States  as well as with its previously declared position on the issue. It is clear that this is one of the chief factors encouraging the Government of Israel publicly to state its intention to establish more Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories and to launch a media campaign in preparation for the final annexation of those territories.73.	If the continuance of the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the denial of the rights of the Arab Palestinian people are the crux of the problem of the Middle East  the obstacles to the solution of this problem are in the intransigence of the leaders of Israel and their adherence to the policy of expansion and settlement  coupled with the inability of this Organization to ensure compliance with its resolutions and the will of the international community because of the position of the United States and its absolute support for Israel.74.	Despite that  scores of resolutions adopted by the Organization have reaffirmed the rights of the Arab Palestinian people  including its inalienable right to return to its territory  to exercise its right of self-determination and to establish its own State on its national soil under the leadership of the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Mo: cover  the continuous struggle of the people of Palestine under PLO leadership has proved the impossibility of establishing a lasting peace in the area without taking into account the rights and demands of the Palestinian Arab people.75.	The participation of the great majority of the Members of this Organization in the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held from 29 August to 7 September at Geneva  was a clear manifestation of solidarity with the struggling people of Palestine. The decisions of the Conference  expressed the general support for that people's inalienable and legitimate rights.76.	As an international rally advocating right and justice  the Conference revealed the isolation of those States that failed to shoulder their responsibilities and confined themselves to participating in the work of the Conference as observers. That position represents a denial of the noble principles of freedom  independence and justice which their peoples were the first to uphold and advocate in the march of mankind in this epoch.77.	Separate attempts to find a partial solution to the conflict in the Middle East have been futile. Similarly  attempts to prevent the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  from participating in these efforts are also futile and unjust and are not really aimed at reaching an equitable and authentic solution to the problem.78.	My country  which has genuinely supported the Palestinian people  as proved by the blood spilt by the Yemeni martyrs in that just cause  reaffirms that any settlement that ignores the PLO and does not confirm the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including its rights to return  to self-determination and to establish its own independent State on its national soil  would be unjust and doomed to failure  because these are the criteria on which the Arab position with regard to the Camp David agreements is based and they will determine our position concerning all future efforts.79.	The Arab States have left no stone unturned in the quest for peace in the Middle East. They proved their genuine desire for a peaceful settlement of the Arab- Israeli conflict when the Arab leaders unanimously agreed  at their summit conference at Fez last year  on a plan for a peaceful solution   which was welcomed by all States and all international and regional organizations that advocate law  justice  and peace.80.	The return by the great Powers to the policy of the cold war and rivalry in acquiring spheres of influence  intervention in the internal affairs of other States and the use of force for the settlement of international disputes are to us sources of both concern and sorrow. There is no doubt that the injection of elements of confrontation and dispute between the East and the West into the regional conflict entails serious risks that may have ominous consequences. Moreover  the failure so far to achieve any significant progress in the negotiations on curbing the arms race  and the intensification of that feverish and alarming race the expenditures on which are more than $800 billion per year  leads us to reiterate that this could bring humanity to the point of no return where its destiny might well depend on some accidental occurrence.81.	The Yemen Arab Republic  which like many other States views all this with profound concern  would welcome any initiative conducive to achieving international detente and curbing the arms race.82.	Proceeding from that premise  we associate ourselves with those who have appealed sincerely to the Soviet Union and the United States to continue their ongoing negotiations on curbing the arms race and to achieve specific results and adopt effective and practical measures in this regard as a prelude to the general and complete elimination of nuclear weapons  so that our people may have a secure future existence and in order to release the resources wasted on the manufacture and purchase of arms for the settlement of the pressing economic problems affecting many countries of the world.83.	The call by the General Assembly to convert the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace free from the rivalry and military presence of the great Powers is an authentic expression of the interest of the peoples of the region in security  prosperity and stability.84.	My country  which has consistently rejected the idea of any foreign military presence in the area of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea  whatever its source or form  fully supports the General Assembly resolution and looks forward to participating in a successful Conference on the Indian Ocean in Sri Lanka next year. We consider the preparations by the great Powers to participate in the proceedings of the Conference to be a positive indication that augurs well.85.	My country  which firmly believes in regional co-operation among neighbouring countries and has always called for continuous dialogue and understanding between the nations and peoples and for settling differences by peaceful means  is greatly concerned about the maintenance of security and stability in the Horn of Africa. It calls for the settlement of the problems among the States of the area through negotiation and dialogue so that they may apply themselves to dealing with questions of development  prevent any foreign intervention in their affairs and avoid being dragged into the conflict between the great Powers.86.	The Iraqi-Iranian war is entering its fourth year. This is a source of both worry and sorrow  especially after the efforts that have been made at mediation. We cannot fail to repeat our appeal for the immediate ending of this ill-fated war and a response by the neighbours and brothers in religion in Iran  to all the efforts made for reconciliation and a just settlement that safeguards the legitimate rights of the two parties to the conflict. 87.	We shall welcome all peace initiatives in response to the mediation efforts and we call on all States  especially those with influence  to continue these serious efforts in order to end this war  which is not in the interest of any of the parties to the conflict either now or in the long run.88.	We also regret that a solution has not yet been found for the question of Afghanistan. We feel that it is right for the Afghan people to have the opportunity to determine its own destiny and to choose the form of regime it will have according to its own will and in a manner acceptable to it without any outside pressure. As a first stage  all forms of intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan should cease  and the refugees should return to their homeland.89.	As regards the Korean question  my country supports the continuance of serious dialogue between the Governments of North and South Korea for the reunification of Korea on a sound democratic basis  free from outside intervention.90.	The development of the situation in Cyprus deepens our conviction concerning the need to work for a solution agreed upon by the two communities as a prelude to the reunification of the island in a manner that ensures for all equality of rights and duties  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.91.	Furthermore  the present developments in Central America affect not only the security and prosperity of the peoples of the Americas  but international peace and security as well. The Yemen Arab Republic views with concern what is taking place in that area. It believes that it is necessary to respect the sovereignty and independence of States of the d ea  not to interfere in their internal affairs and to give the peoples the opportunity to forge their own future in accordance with their will and ambitions  free from any foreign pressures or tutelage.92.	Man's achievements in this century in the efforts to eliminate all forms of colonialism and racism constitute a bright chapter in modern history  marred only by the continuing racist colonialism and foreign occupation in Namibia and Palestine. The alliance between the two racist Governments of Pretoria and Tel Aviv is clearly aimed at uniting their efforts to suppress the national liberation movements in Palestine and Namibia and to stifle the ambitions and aspirations of the peoples of the two countries and their right to freedom  independence and self-determination.93.	We also view with profound concern the increasing co-operation between the racist regimes of Pretoria and Tel Aviv in the manufacture of weapons  especially nuclear weapons  since this constitutes provocation and a threat to the stability and security of the Arab and African States. We call on the countries that provide those two regimes with the material and the potential for the manufacture of nuclear weapons to stop their dealings with those regimes  and at the same time we call on the Arab and African States to increase their vigilance and their co-operation and to close their ranks in order to frustrate the aggressive designs of the two racist regimes.94.	Our people  which is proud of its long-standing struggle and its rejection of all forms of foreign domination  oppression  and tutelage  has firmly and unconditionally supported the legitimate struggle of the people of Namibia for freedom and independence  under the leadership of SWAPO.95.	There is no other way to stamp out the racist occupation of Namibia except by imposing effective sanctions against the Government of Pretoria in order to compel it to implement Security Council resolution 433 (1978)  which constitutes the best framework for a settlement of the problem of Namibia. The prevarications of the Government of South Africa over withdrawing from Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolutions render the Western countries dealing with Pretoria especially accountable for not bringing effective pressure to bear on the Government of South Africa to compel it to end its illegal occupation of the Territory of Namibia.96.	Proud of being free from the polarization and rivalry between the big Powers  my country is committed to and adheres to the policy of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries and its principles and objectives. The success of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held from 7 to 12 March 1983 at New Delhi and in which my country was privileged to participate  has made a tangible contribution to consolidating the unity and solidarity of its members and co-ordinating their efforts to reduce international tension  protect the rights of peoples to sovereignty and national independence and to establish a new just and equitable system of international economic relations. The Non-Aligned Movement has proved to be one of the corner-stones of international stability and security.97.	Economically the international situation is no better than it is politically  with steady deterioration. The present crisis afflicting the world economy is not a cyclical phenomenon but the result of structural maladjustments underlying all aspects of the international economic system. The continuation of this situation will lead to more economic deterioration and directly affect the question of peace and stability in our interdependent world.98.	Our main goal should be the acceleration of the development of the developing countries  giving special attention to the least developed among them. The adoption by the General Assembly of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade has been of some help in improving the course of international economic co-operation and accelerating the development of the developing countries in the context of the international community's search for a new international economic order. However  the setbacks in international economic co-operation and the frustrating results with respect to the global negotiations are not a source of satisfaction.99.	We believe that the problems of development and economic co-operation require urgent action and the crystallization of a strong political will that can help to achieve effective progress that takes account of all sides and can produce abundantly prosperity and well-being for everyone. The position of certain countriesâforemost among them the developed countriesâand their failure to participate seriously in solving the world economic crisis  as well as their espousal of such short-sighted economic policies towards the developing countries as the reduction of official development assistance  the imposition of tariff and non-tariff barriers on the products of the developing countries and the raising of obstacles to the transfer of technology  coupled with the phenomena of inflation  fluctuating exchange rates and higher interest rates  have all helped to deepen the world economic crisis and aggravate its serious effects on the developing countries and their development plans.100.	The discouraging picture of our world today is a source of justified pessimism for many. The problems caused by the deterioration of the international economic crisis and the worsening economic situation of many developing countries are multiplying  with a resulting heightening of tension in international relations.101.	The results of the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held from 6 June to 2 July 1983 at Belgrade  are not adequate for the serious situation in the developing countries  which are suffering from lower growth rates  increasing foreign debts  a reduction in their terms of trade with developed countries and the record decline of earnings from their exports  which consist mainly of primary commodities. Although the results of the UNCTAD session did not measure up to the requirements of the international economy and the aspirations of the developing countries  in particular the least developed countries  the resolutions adopted at the session  and a serious commitment to implement them  could constitute important steps towards beginning to solve the problems of the developing countries and enabling them to take measures to achieve their economic and social development. The commitment of most developed countries to freeze protectionist measures and gradually reduce restrictions on imports from the developing countries will perhaps enable the latter to increase their participation in international production and trade. The consensus reached on a number of questions before the sixth session could also represent a useful step and an encouraging indicator for the continuation of dialogue.102.	In this respect we wish to recall the decisions of the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries/ which were reaffirmed at Belgrade. In these decisions most developed countries undertook to raise the level of their official development assistance to 0.7 per cent and made a commitment to allocate 15 per cent of their official development assistance to the least developed countries and to double that figure by 1985.103.	My country  the Yemen Arab Republic  which at this time is celebrating the twenty-first anniversary of the glorious September revolution  is now passing through a shining period of its history when democratic practices have become part of the daily life of everyone at all levels  through the People's General Congress and in pursuance of the spirit and the letter of the national charter  the intellectual inspiration for the march of our people towards reconstruction  progress and unity.104.	What is significant is that all the genuine national forces have taken part in drafting the charter in a democratic atmosphere unprecedented in our country. This would not have happened without the determination of the political leadership  led by Colonel Ali Abdullah Saleh  President of the Republic and Commander-in- Chief of the Armed Forces and Secretary-General of the People's General Congress  who embodied the true spirit of democracy and of the national charter when he stood before the representatives of the people and proclaimed that  in keeping with the provisions of the constitution  he would not stand for re-election for a second term at the end  of his first term of office. This deepened the great esteem of the people for him and their insistence on re-electing him to guide the march towards the next stage.105.	We consider that the broadening of the base of democratic participation and the adoption of the national charter  as well as the political programme of action  are the most important accomplishments of the past few years in our internal policy. In the economic Held  the attainment of the first five-year plan  and later the second five- year-plan  is a successful achievement in which we take pride and which is clearly reflected in the improved standard of living of our people.106.	In the same measure that our political leadership is interested in achieving more in the field of comprehensive development  it spares no effort  in co-operation with the political leadership in the southern part of the nation  to overcome the fragmentation and division left by British imperialism in the south and by the Imamate rule in the north  a matter which provides more propitious opportunities and greater and better potential for a united and prosperous Yemen to secure permanently security and stability in the area. The meetings of the Yemeni Council  under the chairmanship of the two leaders of the nation  held at the capital city of San'a in the middle of September  give a fresh and strong impetus for accomplishing the Yemeni unity which is the first goal of our people.107.	The foreign policy of our country proceeds from our understanding completely the unity of aim and destiny of the Arab nation. Therefore it makes painstaking and concerted efforts for the unity of the Arab ranks with a view to uniting potentials and abilities for the service of our common goals  with a genuine desire for non-intervention in the internal affairs of others and separating itself from blocs and axes whose effects are detrimental.108.	Moreover  the bonds of faith and the Islamic heritage that link us to the other Islamic countries impel us to contribute effectively to reinforcing collective action through our membership in the Organization of the Islamic Conference in such a way as to serve our common goals in fruitful co-operation in all fields and to defend things sacred to Islam and to participate in building the edifice of contemporary human civilization.109.	Our foreign policy is based on clear and principled foundations reflected by our constant position concerning various international issues. This is also embodied in our growing bilateral relations with friendly fraternal countries. Because of our commitment to the principle of non-alignment  our country has pursued an open-door policy with any country regardless of the social or economic philosophy of the regime of that country and on the basis of non-intervention and mutual respect.110.	We are truly proud of the widening of the circle of our friends and the good fruits that we picked through the relations of friendship  understanding and co-operation.116. My country was afflicted  as the Assembly knows  with an enormous earthquake in December of last year  which led to the destruction of many towns and villages and economic facilities. More than 300 000 people are living in tents. But because of the will of our people and the co-operation of our brothers and friends  we were able to rescue and find refuge  albeit temporary  for those people who were victims of the earthquake  and we have started reconstruction of the affected areas and to renew their economy.111.	However  this will require enormous expenditures that go beyond our own abilities. But we are sure that we will be able to reconstruct because of the resolve of our people and the co-operation of brothers and friends  despite the fact that directing a great part of our limited financial resources for this purpose will affect our development plan.112.	On this occasion we offer our profound thanks to the United Nations for its efforts  through many of the specialized agencies  in the relief operations after the earthquake catastrophe. We also offer special thanks and gratitude to all the friendly and fraternal countries and organizations that gave us a helping hand during the first phase of our continual efforts to overcome the effects of that disaster.113.	I have the great honour  in conclusion  to convey the greetings of the Yemen Arab Republic  both its leadership and people  to all the countries of the world which love peace and which are participating in this session  so that understanding  justice and peace may prevail for the happiness and good of mankind."
"146",7546,"YUG",38,1983,"ï»¿76.	 Mr. President  for me and for my country it is a source of genuine satisfaction to see you  the Vice-President of friendly  non-aligned Panama  with which Yugoslavia maintains-the best of relations  guiding the work of the General Assembly this year. Your rich experience and your high personal qualities give us ample assurance that the proceedings of the General Assembly will be conducted efficiently. I assure you that in this the delegation of Yugoslavia will give its full support.77.	At the same time  I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to the President of the thirty-seventh session  Mr. Imre Hollai of friendly  neighbouring Hungary  who has ably guided the Assembly's deliberations during the past year.78.	I wish also to express from this rostrum our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts in strengthening the role and effectiveness of the world Organization.79.	At the same time  I should like to congratulate the delegation of Saint Christopher and Nevis on the admission of its country to the United Nations.80.	We fully agree that there has been a serious deterioration in world political and economic relations. Contradictions in all fields of international relations have been sharply exacerbated. This is a great burden and threat to mankind today.81.	The present crisis in political and economic relations âperhaps the gravest since the Second World Warâis reaching the critical boundary of risk. This is the consequence of inequalities and disparities and is further aggravated by the policy of bloc rivalry and the arms race. The independence and social development of peoples and nations are increasingly threatened by the use of force and pressure. Interference in internal affairs of other States  military intervention and other forms of encroachment upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries are in the process of becoming common practice. The flaring up of the emergence of new foci of crisis  most frequently in the regions of non-aligned and developing countries  are among the most adverse consequences of such a development  threatening world peace and security.82.	None of us should acquiesce in the situation in which  almost 40 years after the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations  many peoples have not yet achieved freedom and independence and still find themselves under colonial and foreign domination. The prolonged plight of the peoples of Palestine and Namibia provides a striking example in this respect.83.	The economic situation in the world is characterized  above all  by the shifting of the bulk of the burden of the economic crisis on to the shoulders of developing countries  especially the least developed among them. The economic problems are of global proportions and can therefore be solved only by the joint effort of the entire international community. What is needed is comprehensive support on the part of developed countries and international institutions for the efforts of developing countries to overcome the stalemate in their economies  enormous debts and other problems.84.	The arms race is increasingly getting out of control âeven out of the control of its own proponentsâand is leading mankind to the verge of an abyss. Never before have so many resources and efforts and such know-how been invested in the production and development of armaments. All this creates an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear and fosters the use of force  thus jeopardizing democratic achievements and developments in the world. This is particularly evident in Europe  divided between the blocs  where the largest arsenals of nuclear and conventional weapons are already concentrated  and there are threats of new means of destruction as well.85.	It is encouraging that the awareness that exacerbations have reached the upper limitâa limit which it would be dangerous to overstepâis also increasing. Although the dialogue between the big Powers is being conducted on a narrow frontâand  first of all  I have in mind here the Geneva nuclear talksâwe are convinced that it could contribute to the alleviation of confrontation and to the relaxation of tensions. This is exemplified by the successful outcome of the Madrid meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  where the neutral and non-aligned countries of Europe played a significant and constructive role. We hope that these hints of positive development  coupled with the efforts of the largest number of countries  can lead to universal detente. This would constitute a significant step towards the establishment of confidence  equitable co-operation and the solution of key international issues.86.	The Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at New Delhi  launched numerous initiatives in this regard. It also proposed the gathering of world leaders at this session of the General Assembly; Mrs. Gandhi  the Prime Minister of India and Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement  spoke very convincingly about this.87.	Mankind is dramatically faced with the question: peace or war? The answer to the dilemma is found in the policy of peaceful coexistence and broadest international co-operation  which is also the essence of the policy of non-alignment. Therefore  at this critical hour our Movement is calling upon the international community  and upon the big Powers in particular  to prevent the world from sliding towards a nuclear catastrophe.88.	The non-aligned countries are ready to assume their share of responsibility and to co-operate with others with a view to improving the general international situation. As a movement of sovereign States and peoples from all continents  with different social systems  we are united in the efforts aimed at safeguarding peace and security  at the establishment of equitable international relations  the promotion of free economic and social development and the consistent implementation of the Charter of the United Nations. These are  at the same time  the aspirations of the majority of States and of the influential political forces of the world at large.89.	The peace that we advocate is not a state without war  nor is it peace at any cost. It is a peace in which all nations can freely enjoy the fruits of their independence and freedom of development in conditions of equal security. As an independent factor outside blocs  the non- aligned countries are making a substantial contribution to the attainment of that common goal. We expect that the constructive co-operation of all the Member States of the world Organization  particularly of the nuclear Powers and developed countries  will be displayed at this session with a view to finding acceptable ways out of the present crisis.90.	It is high time to adopt measures to halt the arms race  particularly the nuclear arms race  and to launch a process of genuine disarmament. The emphasis placed on nuclear disarmament should by no means cover up the fact that  in terms of destructive power  the distinction between nuclear and conventional weapons is becoming increasingly blurred. Millions of people all over the world demand that reason should prevail over arms and that the potential of mankind should be used for the purposes of peace and progress  since peace cannot be secured by a constant rise in the level of the balance of armament. So far  unfortunately  there has been no adequate response on the part of those most responsible for the present dangerous developments.91.	We consider that the solution of certain specific disarmament issues should be approached without delay. Here we have in mind primarily the conclusion of an agreement on strategic arms reduction and on medium- range missiles  as well as a treaty on a comprehensive nuclear-test ban and a convention on chemical weapons. Furthermore  we believe that comprehensive negotiations on nuclear and conventional disarmament  on the prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction and on measures to prevent nuclear or any other war should start as soon as possible. We welcome all constructive proposals to that end.92.	We attribute special importance to the decision of the Madrid meeting to convene a new conference on security- and confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe. This conference would  in our view  have wider international implications.93.	The United Nations can fulfil its mission of safeguarding international peace and security if it becomes a bulwark supporting the peoples in their struggle against colonial and any other foreign domination and protecting them against force and aggression. Therefore  the world Organization should engage itself more resolutely in the resolution of acute crises. There is today what is termed a ""crisis arc""  stretching from the Mediterranean and the Gulf across southern Africa and South-East and Southwest Asia to Central America. Just and lasting solutions of these crises require the elimination of the policy of faits accomplis and of positions acquired by force  the withdrawal of occupation troops  the cessation of all intervention and interference in the internal affairs of other States and  of course  the exercise by peoples of their right to free development. There can be no peace and security as long as there are oppressed peoples.94.	The Middle East crisis is a continuous cause of concern for us. The Israeli policy of aggression is constantly in the ascendant; the Palestinian people has now been suffering from it for decades. The latest victim of this expansionist policy is Lebanon. However  the recent cease-fire there  which should open up prospects for a solution  through an agreement among all national forces  aimed at preserving the independence  integrity and non- aligned status of Lebanon  is an encouraging sign. Peace in the Middle East can be secured only through a comprehensive and just solution which must ensure the withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab and Palestinian territories occupied since June 1967. There can be no peace without the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights to self-determination  to return to their homes  to independence and to their own State  or without the exercise by all countries of that region of their right to develop in safety and independence. The peace process in the Middle East is not possible without the equal and independent participation of the PLO  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held recently at Geneva  has reaffirmed once again these principles and the basis for the resolution of the Middle East crisis.95.	In view of the fact that security in the Mediterranean is inextricably linked to security in the Middle East  Africa and Europe  Yugoslavia has for a number of years pledged itself to the strengthening of all-round co-operation in eliminating the hotbeds of crisis in the region  as well as to the creation of an atmosphere of trust  in order to transform the Mediterranean into a region of peace  security and equitable co-operation.96.	The situation in southern Africa is becoming ever more explosive because of South Africa's aggressive policy towards the front-line States  its illegal occupation of Namibia and the racist policy of the Pretoria regime. The aggressive acts against Angola and Mozambique have assumed the proportions of a real war The broadest action is indispensable to achieve urgent implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia; it is indispensable in ensuring support for the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of SWAPO  its sole authentic representative  in eliminating the policy of apartheid  and in providing support for the front-line States in their resistance to aggression. The efforts of the OAU to that effect deserve our full recognition and assistance  as do the decisions of the Second World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination The people of Western Sahara should be permitted to exercise their right of self-determination  in compliance with the decisions of the OAU.97.	The United Nations has also laid a foundation for the resolution of the problems of Afghanistan and Kampuchea  as well as those of Cyprus and Korea. It has called for the withdrawal of foreign troops  for non-interference in the internal affairs of those countries  for full respect for their national unity  territorial integrity  sovereignty  independence and non-aligned status  and for respect for the right of peoples to decide their own destinies.98.	We pledge ourselves as well to promote the exercise by the peoples of Central America of their right to free development without any foreign interference or pressure. Full support for the initiative of the Contadora Group  aimed at checking further critical developments in the region and at seeking peaceful solutions  is of paramount importance.99.	It is with deep concern that we note the prolongation of the war between Iran and Iraq. This affects most seriously those two countries  but also peace and security in the region and elsewhere. We support the appeals and initiatives of the United Nations and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  and we call once again on those two non-aligned countries  with which we have friendly relations  to withdraw their troops to the internationally recognized borders and start negotiations.100.	The solution of economic problems is one of the priorities of the international community. Lasting answers can be found only through structural changes conducive to the establishment of the new international economic order based on equitable co-operation and for the benefit of all.101.	The sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development failed to fulfil the hopes and expectations of developing countries. No relevant conclusions were drawn from the broad agreement on difficulties in the world economy  growing interdependence and global responsibility for taking appropriate action towards changing inequitable economic relations  revitalizing economic activity and stimulating development  first and foremost of the developing countries. Furthermore  there is a desire to integrate the developing countries into the existing system.102.	It is high time to overcome narrow interests and really tackle world economic problems for the benefit of the entire world community and therefore of each individual country as well. That is why  more than ever before  we need today a political decision on launching the process of global negotiations within the framework of the United Nations which could be conducted in stages  proceeding from the relatively simpler problems to the more difficult ones. In this context we also attach particular importance to the initiative of the Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries concerning the convening of an international conference on money and finance for development.103.	Post-war developments have amply proved that the destiny of the world cannot be decided by a few States alone  regardless of their size or power. Bloc policy remains constrained and burdened by the outdated system of balance of power based on rivalry from a position of strength.104.	The United Nations has an irreplaceable role and obligations in the search for solutions to problems of peace  security  disarmament and development. Therefore the world Organization must be not only a forum for effective negotiations but also the initiator and the protagonist of the democratic transformation of international relations.105.	The aspiration of peoples to develop in peace  freedom and independence is the basic feature of our epoch. They are with ever greater resolve resisting domination  hegemony  occupation  interference and intervention. This shows that the situation  although very difficult  is not hopeless. The direction of future development will depend to a great extent on our common and continuous action. This implies active co-operation in the struggle against everything that usurps or denies the rights of nations and States and fundamental human rights and freedoms.106.	That is why the relations among the nuclear Powers and the most developed countries  as well as their relations with other countries  are not only their concern. The international community is vitally interested in the normalization of relations and in a substantive dialogue between the great Powers on the basis of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and active and peaceful coexistence.107.	The current session of the General Assembly offers us an opportunity for a constructive dialogue and an agreement to embark  through the broadest possible consensus  on the road leading out of the crisis  to make a turn away from confrontation towards universal detente  to the solution of acute crises  to halting the arms race and to the resolution of international economic problems. This is neither simple nor easy  but there is no other alternative for the maintenance of peace and security  as well as for the promotion of general development. Yugoslavia  pursuing the policy founded by President Tito  will do everything it can  together with all those striving towards the same objectives  to ensure that the spirit of mutual respect  co-operation and democratic dialogue prevails  thus opening up better prospects for the benefit of the international community.

"147",7612,"ZMB",38,1983,"ï»¿69.	 Mr. President  I wish to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that with your vast knowledge and experience in international relations you will ably steer this session towards a successful conclusion. I assure you of my delegation's full co-operation.70.	I wish also to commend your predecessor  Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  for having ably presided over the thirty-seventh session.71.	Let me also convey my delegation's appreciation to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts in the search for world peace and security. We commend him for his report on the work of the Organization  in which he has defined with candour some of the major problems that confront the world today.72.	My delegation is pleased to welcome into this great family of nations the newly independent State of Saint Christopher and Nevis  and we look forward to working and co-operating with this new State.73.	We meet once again against the backdrop of a serious deterioration in the international situation. The tension born of mutual suspicion and mistrust between the super-Powers has of late led to particularly virulent  bellicose and confrontational posturing and has thus gravely polluted the international atmosphere  thereby increasing the danger to international peace and security. There is an element of super-Power rivalry in practically every serious trouble-spot in the third world. We see this in regional conflicts such as those in Central America  Chad  .southern Africa  the Gulf and the Middle East. Even Namibia  a question that is concerned only with decolonization  has not escaped the injection of East- West rivalries.74.	The grave international situation is  moreover  reflected in the deadlock in the initiatives to find solutions in the areas of disarmament  international economic relations and general questions of peace and security in various parts of the world.75.	This disturbing global atmosphere prompted the heads of State or Government of non-aligned countries to issue the New Delhi Message at their conference last March. That was an earnest appeal on the part of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries for a genuine global dialogue to seek urgently practical  just and lasting solutions in the interest of our common humanity. It was an appeal for a spirit of give and take  indeed an appeal for political will on the part of world statesmen. The concern of the Non- Aligned Movement for world peace and security is indeed reflected in the presence of many heads of State or Government of non-aligned countries at this session of the General Assembly.76.	More than ever before  the arms race has become the greatest peril facing mankind. It has manifested itself in the qualitative and quantitative development of nuclear and conventional weapons. To these have been added new generations of lethal chemical weapons. There is also the danger of extending the arms race into outer space. AH these developments have greatly increased the danger to the survival of the human race. There is an urgent need to halt the nuclear-arms race  to reverse it and to begin a process of genuine nuclear disarmament.77.	No less urgent is the need to put a stop to the production and spread of conventional weapons. Conventional weapons are in everyday use in all the hotbeds of conflict which span the globe. Since the Second World War  conventional weapons have been used to cause millions of human deaths and incalculable destruction of property and infrastructures. They are  therefore  a more serious problem than we may be inclined to think.78.	The squandering of a large proportion of the world's Unite resources on the arms race  thereby depriving the world of much-needed means for development and human progress  is scandalous. The developed world spends more on the means of destruction than the over two billion of the World's poorest people have to spend on the means of survival. Thus at present nearly $800 billion is being spent on armaments  while social and economic development is lagging far behind acceptable levels in many parts of the third world.79.	The world is thus confronted with increasing turbulence  uncertainty and tension. The major Powers are unable to provide the one important thing that mankind badly needs  which is hope. We need some hope that the international environment can improve quickly so as to permit desirable co-operation and resolution of conflicts by peaceful means.80.	Zambia regrets lack of progress in disarmament negotiations. We reaffirm our support for the view that world peace and security can be guaranteed only through general and complete disarmament under effective international control.81.	In global affairs  politics and economics certainly do not divide easily into separate compartments; East- West discord is bound to affect North-South progress. It is therefore in the economic interest of the third world that there be a lessening of tension between the two power blocs of the world.82.	Let me now turn to the economic problems which our world is facing today. The latest issue of the WorldEconomic Survey  compiled by the Secretariat's Department of International Economic and Social Affairs  is yet another sad commentary on our inability to control and develop our economic and social environment in an orderly and harmonious manner. It conveys further a message which is more serious: we are slowly drifting from a crisis into a calamity  simply because we have allowed the perpetuation of systems that can no longer bear the stresses and strains imposed on them by our modern economic and social demands.83.	The structural imbalances and the inequalities of the present world economic system were recognized nearly two decades ago  not only by the developing countries but by the industrialized world as well. It is therefore distressing to note that at this time  despite the worsening international economic situation  the hoped-for North- South dialogue in all essential areas has now moved from stalemate to retrogression.84.	In the meantime  the plight of the millions of people in many parts of the world  particularly in the developing countries  who are now enveloped in a miasma of poverty  disease  hunger and ultimately starvation  continues unabated. The question which the developing countries ask is what is their prospect for development and what is their chance of becoming less poor? There can be no doubt that poverty  in its acuteness and its inequity  is an affront to human dignity. Therefore  we must all be concerned about it.85.	We should all recognize the current shortcomings of our present economic management. We can go further by acknowledging that each and every country is intricately integrated into the world-wide economy and  therefore  that measures adopted at the national level cannot by themselves suffice to rectify or remedy the situation even within national borders. That being the case  we should like to take note of measures being pursued by some industrialized countries in their bid to curb inflation within their borders. The strategy of reducing inflation  while much appreciated by all  should be accompanied by reduced interest rates if benefits are to accrue from such an approach  lest the well-orchestrated signs of recovery turn out to be a mirage.86.	The heads of State or Government of the non- aligned countries called for global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development  at their sixth conference  at Havana in 1979  and reiterated that call at the seventh conference at New Delhi this year. They expressed their firm conviction that global negotiations remained the most important and comprehensive endeavour of the international community for restructuring the international economic system  accelerating development of the economies of developing countries and strengthening multilateral economic co-operation on the basis of mutual benefit.87.	The impasse in working out measures to enhance international co-operation cannot be attributed to any lack of effort on our part. During the first six months of this year various important meetings devoted to economic issues were held at the highest political level. The heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries  at their seventh conference  adopted the Declaration on Collective Action for Global Prosperity That conference was closely followed by the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held from 28 March to 9 April at Buenos Aires  at which a message for dialogue and consensus was adopted and later submitted to the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at Belgrade/ The proposals agreed on at those meetings have been conveyed to our partners in the North  and the industrialized countries had ample opportunity to discuss and agree on these proposals at the Ministerial Meeting of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Summit of Industrialized Nations  at Williamsburg.88.	Despite those prior informal exchanges  no measure of consensus on essential areas was reached at that fateful session at Belgrade.89.	In today's world  where the interdependence of nations and the interrelatedness of issues have become facts of life  we need more than ever to discover those points of convergence where the interests of a wider humanity become those of its separate parts. Regrettably  in the words of Mr. Shridath Ramphal  the Commonwealth Secretary-General:""The expectation that North and South would jointly find a way to make the world economy both more fair and more secure has been belied. It has been easier to agree upon the growing interdependence of the world economy than to face up to its implications; easier to acknowledge that the recession is world-wide than to accept world-wide solutions; easier to recognize a global crisis than to accommodate the need for global approaches to its solution.""90.	It must be realized that economic recovery is not likely to be forthcoming if done piecemeal. However  international co-operation will be a reality only if we are able to formulate effective international policy measures which can be translated into concrete actions and coordinated national policies. Since the international policy measures have to be all-embracing  covering development  trade  industry  money and finance  transfer of technology and so on  it is fitting and proper that a consensus on all these issues be reached in a global forum; hence the urgent need to launch the global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development.91.	Disparities in the conditions of human existence cannot be redressed without of international action. However  as President Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania has said:""The problems of the third world will not wait until we have eventually managed to introduce big changes in the international economic institutions. In the meantime  we could help ourselves  and each other  if we worked more actively to promote South-South tradeâ that is trade among third world countries.""92.	The questions of peace and security  disarmament and international economic relations which I have addressed call urgently for solution.93.	I now wish to reiterate Zambia's position on a number of specific political issues which continue to trouble international relations and threaten world peace and security.94.	Zambia views with grave concern the prevailing tense situation in Central America  which is being aggravated by external interference in the internal affairs of the States in the region. This tension can be arrested only if all the States in the region can apply the maximum effort to resolve peacefully the issues involved. To this end  we applaud the initiative of the Contadora Group to bring about a negotiated settlement in the region.95.	The situation in Chad has taken a turn for the worse. We in Zambia are concerned about the internationalization of the conflict in that country. We call for an immediate end to all foreign intervention and interference in the internal affairs of Chad and for all concerned to co-operate with the Organization of African Unity in its efforts to find a just and lasting solution.96.	There is an urgent need to find a lasting solution to the problem of Western Sahara. The Saharan people should be enabled to determine their own destiny through a genuine referendum under the auspices of the OAU. Until such a referendum is held  Zambia will continue to support the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic under the leadership of the POLISARIO Front.97.	The question of Cyprus continues to concern us in Zambia. For this reason we urge the continuation of intercommunal talks and the good offices of the Secretary-General aimed at resolving the problem. We reaffirm our support for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus and demand the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces from the island.98.	The conflict between Iran and Iraq continues on its ruthless and bloody path  with no end in sight. Its cost in terms of human and material resources is immense and its threat to international peace and security is a matter of great international concern. We urge the two parties to put an immediate end to this fratricidal conflict.99.	The situations of conflict and tension in Afghanistan and Kampuchea continue to be of grave concern to my country. We believe that the problems of the two countries have arisen because of failure to respect the principles of non-interference and non-intervention in the affairs of States. We call for comprehensive political solutions to these problems which provide for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and ensure full respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries.100.	With regard to Korea  I wish to reiterate Zambia's position of support for the Korean people's desire to reunify their country peacefully in conformity with the principles set forth in the joint South-North Communique of 4 July 1972.S We believe that the achievement of reunification would be greatly facilitated by the withdrawal of all foreign forces from South Korea.101.	Zambia deplores the increase in great-Power presence and rivalry in and around the Indian Ocean  which is contrary to the aims and objectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We firmly believe that meaningful progress should be made in giving effect to that Declaration. To this end we urge all States to co-operate fully to ensure the convening of the long-delayed Conference on the Indian Ocean  now scheduled to take place in June 1984 at Colombo.102.	The Middle East remains one of the most volatile areas in the world. In spite of the efforts of the United Nations  no solution appears to be in sight. On the contrary  the situation in the area has worsened and assumed more and more alarming proportions  all because of the policies and practices of Israel. Last year  for instance  the international community witnessed the savage and revolting Israeli invasion of Lebanon  which wreaked havoc on innocent human life  as well as property. That invasion was aimed at the liquidation of the Palestinians.103.	Peace and security in the Middle East will remain elusive as long as Israel persists in its denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. As the General Assembly has repeatedly stated  and as was reaffirmed at the International Conference on the Question of Palestine  held at Geneva from 29 August to 7 September  the question of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people is at the core of the Middle East conflict. The solution to this problem lies in Israel's recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and not in their liquidation. The international community should therefore guard against diversionary manoeuvres by Israel and its collaborators on this central issue.104.	Zambia will continue to fully support the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the PLO  in their just struggle for the exercise of their inalienable rights and the establishment of a State of their own in Palestine. We shall also continue to demand immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967.105.	I now wish to deal with the situation in southern Africa  where we continue to confront three major problems whose impact on the region is of gigantic proportions and which pose a threat to international peace and security: namely  the liberation and genuine independence of Namibia; apartheid and minority rule in South Africa; and the destabilization of independent neighbouring States by South Africa. All these problems have been brought about and are kept alive by the apartheid regime of South Africa. Thus  the apartheid regime of South Africa is the rogue in southern Africa.106.	The question of Namibia's independence continues to arouse grave anxiety and frustration. As we meet today  the independence of Namibia is as remote as ever. There does not seem to be any end to the blocks that are constantly being set up on the road to Namibia's independence.107.	We are meeting in the aftermath of the Secretary- General's recent visit to southern Africa and the submission of his report on the visit  dated 29 August 1983. It is clear from his report that South Africa continues to predicate Namibia's independence on the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. This position of South Africa  engineered by the United States of America  is responsible for the failure to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  despite the fact that virtually all relevant issues have been resolved.108.	I should like to reiterate Zambia's position that the claimed linkage being insisted upon is unquestionably illegal  irrational  irrelevant  diversionary and  therefore  totally unacceptable. The question of the presence of Cuban forces in Angola is a bilateral matter between the Governments of the two sovereign States  that is  Angola and Cuba. It has nothing to do with South Africa's withdrawal from Namibia. Zambia rejects any attempt to shift responsibility for the delay in resolving the Namibian issue on to Angola. The introduction of the extraneous issue of linkage is also designed to turn the independence of Namibia into an East-West problem. Zambia insists that the question of Namibia should be seen in its proper perspective and must remain a purely decolonization matter.109.	It is the hope of my delegation that the Security Council will soon meet to take appropriate measures for the implementation of its resolution 435 (1978). The Council has a responsibility  indeed a duty  to take practical measures to ensure implementation of its own resolution without further delay.110.	It is evident that unless the implementation process begins immediately  the conflict in Namibia will escalate. The Namibian people will justifiably intensify their struggle for freedom and independence. Human life will continue to be lost  property to be destroyed. In these circumstances  it is incumbent upon all freedom-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples to increase their material and other forms of support to SWAPO  the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people  so that & quick end to the conflict can be secured through all means.111.	With regard to South Africa  let me state what we all know: there is in that country an open and continued gross violation of the basic human and democratic principles of justice  freedom  equality  respect for the human person  and majority rule. This is not a matter of failure in the implementation of accepted human and democratic principles. Those in power in South Africa are not struggling to attain these principles; they are deliberately and actively organizing South African society so as to destroy the hold of these principles on the minds of men. The abhorrent policy and practice of the dismemberment and bantustanization of South Africa  the current so-called constitutional reforms  South Africa's continued stranglehold on Namibia and the destabilization of neighbouring independent States are all geared towards this goal.112.	Justice  freedom  equality  human dignity  majority rule and national independence are values of life to be cherished; they are not mere political or philosophical concepts. When oppressed or colonized people struggle for justice  for their dignity  for their liberty and for their independence  they do so to uphold these values and to preserve them for mankind as a whole. This is precisely what the oppressed and colonized peoples of South Africa and Namibia are struggling for. It is against this background that we in Africa and in our region support the liberation struggles in South Africa and Namibia.113.	Under the prevailing circumstances  the oppressed people of South Africa have been left with no other alternative but to fight for their birthright  to regain their freedom  justice and human dignity. The recent spate of bombings in the land of apartheid is a living testimony to the determination of the oppressed people there to carry out the struggle to its logical conclusion.114.	In response to that challenge  the racist regime has intensified its suppression in the vain hope that it will subdue the oppressed masses. However  there can be no turning the clock back in South Africa. Apartheid will certainly be dismantled; freedom and majority rule will certainly be secured in South Africa  however long it may take to achieve that. The question is thus really one of the method of achieving these goals  through violence and armed struggle  or through peaceful change.115.	In recent times there have been a number of contacts and meetings between representatives of some frontline States and those of the South African regime. At the same time we have witnessed continuing and increasing aggressive activities being perpetrated by the South African regime and by bandits and dissident groups recruited  trained  financed and armed by it against other States in southern Africa  resulting in the destruction of human life and transport and economic infrastructures in these States. To this day  South African troops are illegally occupying part of Angola  while Mozambique and Lesotho  in particular  continue to be subjected to severe economic and military pressures by the South African regime. These are not the actions of a regime that wants to see peace and stability brought about quickly in our region or to see peaceful resolution of the problems we confront in it. Maybe the South African regime regards such contacts and meetings as nothing more than tactical opportunities to hoodwink the world into believing that it is prepared to participate in the quest for peaceful and constructive change in southern Africa in general and in South Africa in particular  whereas what it seeks is to consolidate the present unacceptable situation.116.	South Africa's acts of aggression and destabilization of neighbouring States	will not cow those States into submission. For its part  Zambia remains committed to the total eradication of apartheid and minority rule and to this end will continue to render support to the oppressed people of South Africa and the national liberation movement  the African National Congress of South Africa.117.	We in Zambia are distressed by the somewhat ambivalent posture of some Members of this Organization who are friends and allies of South Africa. On the one hand they profess abhorrence of	while on the other they pursue policies that are supportive of a regime whose policies are deeply rooted in that same diabolical system. Furthermore  when called upon to apply comprehensive sanctions against South Africa or to use other forms of the enormous leverage they undoubtedly have with that country to bring about desirable change by peaceful means  these countries continue to plead their preference for persuasion  but at the same time they disclaim effective power to persuade. The regime has in fact interpreted such a posture of its allies and friends as an endorsement and approval of its internal as well as its external policies and practices.118.	It is against this background that we call upon all those countries that have leverage with South Africa  whether through economic  military or other ties  to come out boldly and unambiguously and use their influence to persuade South Africa to cease all acts of aggression and destabilization against its neighbours and  above all  to abandon the system of119.	We appeal to the international community to give all possible material and humanitarian assistance to the oppressed peoples of Africa who are victims of the regime. In addition  we call upon the international community to come to the aid of such countries as Lesotho  Mozambique and Angola  which are constantly subjected to economic and political blackmail and sabotage as well as military incursions by the regime of South Africa.120.	Finally  I wish to reaffirm Zambia's faith in the United Nations. Although its conception was rooted in the past and its edifice erected subsequent to times of war  it remains the only appropriate international forum for finding solutions to major world problems today. It is  therefore  incumbent upon all of us as States Members of the Organization to reaffirm our continued commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations and to summon the necessary political will to make this institution work.

"148",7644,"ZWE",38,1983,"ï»¿100.	My first and most pleasant duty is to congratulate you  Mr. President  your Government and the people of Panama on the honour which this session of the General Assembly has bestowed upon you by electing you as its President. The General Assembly is also to be commended for its very good choice of a steward. Your now very well-known qualities of leadership and statesmanship  so amply tested and demonstrated during the period you served your Government and country in various capacities  including that of Vice-President  and your wide knowledge of international affairs qualify you most eminently for the elevated position which you now hold.101.	May I also add my own voice and that of my delegation to the many which have already paid tribute to Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary  the President of the thirty-seventh session  for the exemplary manner in which he fulfilled the duties and responsibilities of his office.102.	I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate and welcome to the Assembly the new Member  the sovereign State of Saint Christopher and Nevis  and to express our best wishes for its prosperity at home and for a most satisfying participation in the deliberations of the Assembly.103.	The thirty-eighth session is taking place against the background of a very dark and threatening international scene. Many speakers who have addressed the Assembly before me have made this point. Indeed  the annual report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization  submitted for our consideration  conveys the same warning:  1983 has  so far  been a frustrating year for the search for peace  stability and justice and for those who believe that the United Nations is the best available international instrumentality to achieve these ends .104.	I wish by way of prefacing my brief review of the international scene to recommit my own Government and country to the purposes and principles of the United Nations  as outlined in the Charter  and especially to the maintenance of international peace and security.105.	It was because of this commitment to the principle of collective international security that Zimbabwe rendered its modest contribution to the Security Council's consideration of the report on the work of the Organization submitted at the thirty-seventh session by the Secretary-General    searching for ways and means of enhancing the effectiveness of the Council as the body charged with the primary responsibility for ensuring international peace and security.106.	With the indulgence of the Assembly  I should like now to begin my brief observations on the international scene from the standpoint of my own region  southern Africa  one of the regions in which international peace  stability and security are very gravely threatened.107.	Today  the closely related and complementary systems of apartheid and Zionism are  understandably  the most spoken about and the most roundly condemned in all international forums. Indeed  in this very Assembly  speaker after speaker has drawn urgent attention to racist Pretoria's dangerous domestic and k /ional policies. Domestically  the racist regime continues its policy of politically discriminating against and relentlessly exploiting the masses of the black majority  economically and culturally.108.	Having been denied all possibilities of attaining political and social change by peaceful means  the oppressed South African masses are now  as would any people in similar circumstances  waging a war of liberation against the racist white minority regime. As we believe in the justice and legitimacy of their cause  we support their demand for international support  diplomatic  moral and material  and we call upon the international community  especially the United Nations  to intervene effectively in South Africa. The racist regime's archaic apartheid philosophy and policies are not only decidedly against the entire march of human history but are increasingly threatening stability  peace and security in our region. We must warn that such a threat to the stability of this vital region will produce vibrations and tremors  with dire consequences for international peace and security.109.	Feeling itself very much cornered by the escalating domestic liberation struggle  as well as by the Namibian struggle  and by the consolidation of true and genuine freedom and social justice in the neighbouring independent States  the apartheid Pretoria regime is espousing and practising a policy of confrontation and open conflict against the free nations in the region. Thus  no country  from the People's Republic of Angola in the West  to the Republic of Seychelles on the Indian Ocean  and from the Kingdom of Lesotho  in the regime's own hot belly  to Zambia in the North  is being spared from Pretoria's destabilizing campaigns. These campaigns assume all sorts of forms and shapes  including blatantly naked and unprovoked military aggression  as has been unleashed against Angola during the past two years  against Seychelles and Lesotho in 1982  and against Mozambique and Zimbabwe occasionally.110.	It is common knowledge that Pretoria also recruits  trains  equips and infiltrates into our countries unpatriotic and dissident elements  who harass  kill and maim innocent civilians engaged in productive development. Also taking effective advantage of geographical and historical economic links with its economically weak neighbours  the regime openly and brazenly sabotages their respective economies.111.	The catalogue of examples of Pretoria's acts of aggression  brutality  and political and economic destabilization  would be too long to read within the scope of an address of this nature. Suffice it to say  therefore  that military aggression and economic brute bullying and blackmail are causing great difficulty and suffering to the peoples of the region  including the slaughtering and massacring of many innocent souls.112.	As we have pointed out elsewhere  Pretoria's policy of regional destabilization has as some of its main objectives the following: first  the negation of the liberation struggle at home and in Namibia which  in arrogant defiance of the Namibian people and the entire international community  South Africa continues to occupy; secondly  the racist regime wants to intimidate and deter front-line and other States in the region from supporting the struggling masses in South Africa and Namibia; thirdly  the regime is also desperately battling to foil and frustrate our regional economic co-operation and endeavour within the context of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference.113.	While making it absolutely clear to South Africa that it will not succeed in any of its insidious and diabolic aims  we must also warn the Assembly that the lack of any appreciable progress on the question of Namibia's decolonization is now an international scandal and a great shame to the Organization. Equally disturbing and disconcerting is the apparent indifference of certain Members of the Organization  which are also permanent members of the Security Council  to the gravity of the threat which Pretoria's defiance of international demands for Namibian independence poses to the reputation and effective role of the United Nations. It is now four years since Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  embodying a realistic and internationally acceptable formula for the achievement of Namibian independence  was adopted. Yet not only do the resolution and the United Nations plan remain unimplemented  gathering thick layers of dust  but there is also real concern that some of their authors are  wittingly or otherwise  casting dark shadows of doubt upon the entire plan by encouraging South African intransigence.114.	Since the abortive pre-implementation Geneva meeting of 1981  the failure of which is entirely attributable to South African intransigence  which in turn was encouraged by mixed signals from certain capitals  we have been presented with a series of pretexts to delay the implementation of the United Nations plan on the independence of Namibia. South Africa was said to be harbouring reservations about the United Nations impartiality in supervising elections in Namibia  as provided for under the plan. Although we knew that such reservations were utterly unfounded  we took them into consideration  to the satisfaction of the Pretoria regime itself and to those among the Western contact group who seemed to be sympathetic to the regime's view.115.	In retrospect  however  the folly of making any concessions to that nonsense about United Nations impartiality is painfully obvious. For  when in August last year we were all agreed that every issue relevant to the plan was in place  and we were preparing to approach the Security Council to adopt an enabling resolution  setting in motion the process of implementing the United Nations plan  further issues were raised  at first by a Security Council member which also belongs to the Western contact group. The Pretoria regime  then desperately looking for excuses to delay further the independence of Namibia  was only too grateful when one was thrown into its lap by that country.116.	As the Assembly knows  since August of last year  South Africa and that member of the Western contact group have maintained that the Namibians should remain under Pretoria's illegal occupation until the Cuban forces that have been in Angola since 1975  when Angola invited them in to help defend that country against South African aggression  have been withdrawn. Members will recall that  in an effort to obtain South African co-operation in the immediate implementation of the United Nations plan  the Security Council adopted resolution 532 (1983) in May of this year  empowering the Secretary-General to hold consultations with the parties to the cease-fire agreement proposed under the plan. The Secretary- General has since published a report on his visit to South Africa  Namibia and Angola  in fulfilment of his mandate. The Secretary-General says that  although every outstanding issue relevant to resolution 435 (1978) has been resolved and we are tantalizingly close to finality on the modalities of implementing the plan   the position of South Africa regarding the issue of the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola as a precondition for the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) still makes it impossible to launch the United Nations plan. ?117.	I must reiterate here my Government's total condemnation and rejection of any attempt  from whatever quarter  to bring any new factors into the Namibian decolonization equation. This linkage  besides being obviously unfair  illogical  irrelevant  illegal and grossly immoral  is also a very serious breach of resolution 435 (1978). It must be borne in mind that this resolution  which was the result of painstaking consultations and negotiations  was and is still strictly meant to be the basis of a solution to the Namibian question only. It was never meant to be a prescription for a comprehensive solution of the problems of the southern African region as a whole  least of all to provide for the geopolitical concerns and preoccupations of any Power or group of Powers.118.	It is also becoming increasingly clear that linkage is nothing but a smoke-screen designed to conceal the fact that it is South Africa that must unconditionally withdraw its own troops which have been occupying parts of the Angolan territory for over two years now. When are those racist forces which have brought so much misery and death to Angola going to leave that country? Why should the international community be required to interfere in a matter that rightly concerns Angola and Cuba? Besides  have any of the Cuban soldiers been found on South African territory? Why should the Cuban forces in Angola be regarded as a stumbling-block to the independence of Namibia?119.	We also reject linkage because it is calculated to give the wrong impression that it is Angola which is responsible for the current deadlock on the Namibian question. We cannot accept this wicked view  which seeks to shift the blame and responsibility from the perpetrator to the victim of the injurious act. It is South African intransigence that has brought about the deadlock  and pressure must be brought to bear upon South Africa until that regime leaves Namibia and Angola. In this the role of the contact group members is critical. They must now stop pampering the regime and tell it that enough is enough. We call upon each of them  as a first step  to condemn and reject linkage categorically  and demand Pretoria's compliance with United Nations demands to make possible the immediate implementation of resolution 435 (1978). We must warn the members of the Western contact group that they cannot afford to equivocate regarding the need totally to reject linkage and to reaffirm their total commitment to the immediate and unconditional implementation of resolution 435 (1978). This immediate removal of ambiguities will help to arrest the rapid erosion of the little confidence in them that may still exist among front-line States and  indeed  in the entire African continent. They have an opportunity to do this now and at the forthcoming Security Council meeting  which will also consider the report of the Secretary- General.120.	If  however  South Africa refuses to co-operate  the Council should be asked to take appropriate action  in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.121.	Let me now explain our position on other troubled areas of Africa. Zimbabwe has always viewed the question of Western Sahara as that of a people yearning and fighting for self-determination. Consequently we support the demand of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic for self-determination and sovereignty  and sincerely hope that Morocco  a key member of the OAU  will soon reconcile itself to this reality. Such a step by Morocco would bring peace to the area  to the benefit of the peoples of Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic.122.	For about two decades Chad has known no peace. The people of Chad  like any people  have a right to peace and undisturbed economic and social development. It is our view that the fratricidal wars and strife which continue to bring death and misery to the people of Chad are to a very large extent the result of external interference in the affairs of that State. We therefore call upon the Assembly to demand the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Chad to enable the people of Chad to discuss their problems among themselves  under the auspices of the OAU.123.	The question of security in and around the Indian Ocean has been an item on the international agenda ever since the Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Lusaka in 1970  which called upon all States to respect the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. Zimbabwe fully endorses this demand. We call upon those that bring weapons of mass destruction to the region and those super-Powers involved in competition and rivalry for spheres of influence to end those activities  .which continue to threaten peace and security in the region. We equally condemn the maintenance of foreign military bases and call upon all concerned to respect fully General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) of 1971.124.	The situation in the Middle East continues to cause great concern to the international community. Zionist Israel's invasion of Lebanon last year and the subsequent slaughtering of hundreds of Palestinian refugees at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps are but two of the numerous ugly manifestations of the Zionist killer instinct and are reminiscent of Nazi barbarity. Surely the international community does not need other Sabras and Shatilas to jolt it into realizing that Zionism is one of the most deadly threats to international peace and security. The international community should demand of Israel unconditional withdrawal from all the Palestinian and Arab lands which it has been occupying since 1967. We believe that this would contribute greatly to the finding of a peaceful and lasting settlement in that region. We are convinced that no solution to the Middle East question can be just and lasting unless it recognizes and guarantees the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and an independent Palestinian State.125.	It is also a matter of deep regret that for over two years two very dear Members of the Organization have been involved in an internecine war. I am referring here to the very unfortunate war between Iran and Iraq  both of which are friends of Zimbabwe. We reiterate here our appeal to them to do their utmost to settle this conflict without delay by negotiation. The continuation of this war  which has already caused a great deal of suffering and misery  apart from costing each country very dear in material terms  is in no one's interest.126.	The question of Cyprus has been before the Assembly for a long time now  and we are deeply concerned that no solution to it seems to be in sight. Foreign intervention and occupation continue there  seriously threatening that country's sovereign independence  territorial integrity and the unity of its people. The President of Cyprus has proposed the total demilitarization of that country and Zimbabwe fully supports this proposal.127.	As a small country  holding very dear the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the affairs of sovereign States  Zimbabwe is greatly disturbed whenever and wherever there is evidence of their violation  even if the violators are our friends. Accordingly  we must record our deep concern about foreign intervention and interference in Afghanistan  Kampuchea  on the Korean peninsula and in East Timor. We must observe  with deep regret  that in most instances  though not necessarily in all  the perpetrators of intervention and interference in the affairs of other States are permanent members of the Security Council who  by their position  should be most aware of the heavy and special responsibility for international peace and security which the Charter has placed on them.128.	We call upon those concerned to leave the peoples of Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Korea and East Timor freely to exercise their right to determine their own social and political systems  and to choose their leaders without any intervention and interference. With particular reference to the Korean situation  we must warn that die perpetuation of the idea of  two Koreas  by foreign Powers not only destroys any prospects for a peaceful solution of this problem  but it also aggravates the tension which has existed on the peninsula for a long time now. It has been and continues to be our view that the continuing military build-up in the south of the peninsula militates against any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the South and the North. Accordingly the Assembly should  in our view  call for the immediate withdrawal of those foreign troops  so as to set a stage for the peaceful reunification of Korea.129.	In concluding my comments on the violations of the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the affairs of States  I now want to turn to the situation in Central America. There  tension  and sometimes even open conflict  continue gravely to threaten regional peace and stability  with very serious consequences for international peace and security. This tension is very largely attributable to foreign intervention and interference  aimed at destabilizing and undermining progressive Governments in the region and in the Caribbean area. Nicaragua is a typical example of one of the countries target ed for campaigns of destabilization and aggression from the outside. Cuba and Grenada have also been  and continue to be  targets and are subjected to all sorts of blackmail and intimidation by an external Power.130.	We have emphasized elsewhere that having waged a heroic and truly revolutionary struggle against the externally propped-up and supported Fascist dictatorship of Somoza  the hard-working Nicaraguans need to be left alone in peace and quiet to forge ahead with the challenging task of economic and social reconstruction and rehabilitation. For this formidable task  Nicaragua needy the maximum mobilization of its financial  material and manpower resources. Unfortunately  however  Nicaragua has been  and continues to be  compelled to divert most of these scarce resources towards the defence of its territorial integrity and sovereign independence from external aggression. Zimbabwe strongly condemns the activities of the criminal and counter-revolutionary elements that are being recruited  equipped and directed by foreign powers to destabilize Nicaragua. We shall continue to support fully the heroic people of Nicaragua in their struggle to defend their hard-won revolution131.	Similarly  we note with deep concern that a dispute exists between the two neighbouring countries of Guyana and Venezuela. We wish to call upon the two parties to strive for a peaceful and just settlement to this very unfortunate dispute. In our view  such a settlement can only be attained through the strict observance of United Nations and Non-Aligned Movement principles relating to the inadmissibility of the use or threat of force in the settlement of disputes. We further wish to point out that no settlement can be regarded as fair and just unless it respects and guarantees Guyana's independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty. Finally  Zimbabwe wishes to affirm the position taken at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting  held at Melbourne in 1981.132.	Members will recall that international peace and security were gravely threatened last year when tension between the United Kingdom and Argentina erupted into open military conflict. Our position is that the two parties should initiate earnest negotiations for a peaceful and just solution to the Falkland or Malvinas Islands question without delay  in order to avoid the recurrence of last year's dangerous events.133.	Our efforts to ensure respect for the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the affairs of States  as well as whatever endeavours we may undertake to improve social and economic conditions in our respective societies and world-wide  cannot by themselves inspire confidence in the future  as long as humanity continues to live under the spectre of a nuclear holocaust. We are most concerned that the more the nuclear Powers  especially the two super-Powers  talk about arms reduction and disarmament  the more they increase and perfect their respective military capabilities  including military nuclear power. For instance  the same countries have been carrying out many tests since 1963  when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  the United States and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water. Also  during the same period  the acquisition of military nuclear technology has spread to other countries.134.	Consequently  today  in spite of arms reduction and disarmament talks  the world has seen an unprecedented piling up of military weaponry  including nuclear arsenals of such deadly perfection that should their use ever be resorted to in any conflict the outcome will be total destruction of this planet. With one clear and loud voice  therefore  we must demand an immediate end to the arms race  for there can be no real peace and security as long as we live in constant fear that one day some mad person may pull the nuclear trigger and reduce us and the planet to ashes. True peace and security can be ensured only by general and complete disarmament  especially nuclear disarmament  under international control.135.	I wish now to comment on the current world economic situation  which is characterized by inequitable relations and a crisis unprecedented in modern times. There is a very serious decline in economic activity  which has had a particularly debilitating effect upon developing countries. The world economy's rate of growth has also seen and continues to experience a marked contraction  although we hear that there are signs of recovery. For instance  whereas the 1980-1981 output increased by 1 per cent  in 1981-1982 it tumbled even below that level. Similarly  for the first time in almost half a century  world trade declined by 6 per cent in 1982.136.	This unprecedented malaise in the world economy has also been accompanied by very disturbing stagnation. In response to this  some industrialized countries made the combating of inflation a primary objective of macro- economic policy. In most cases  however  this produced no satisfactory results or  where relative success was achieved  it was at the risk of a downward movement of aggregate economic activity and unemployment. This  therefore  largely contributed to the staggering number of 30 million unemployed people in the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The upward movement of commodity prices  symptomatic of this accelerated inflation  has also had a devastatingly adverse effect on developing countries. In particular it has limited imports of food and capital goods which are vital to programmes of economic development.137.	Also  for the first time in 35 years  prices of commodity exports from developing countries have plummeted  and have now reached their lowest levels. Added to that  developing countries find it increasingly difficult to gain access to markets in the developed countries  largely on account of protectionism. There is  therefore  a serious decline in the foreign exchange earnings of developing countries  causing a corresponding contraction in their import capacity  amounting to $85 billion during the past two years. This has also led to a decline in their exports to industrialized countries  which in turn threatens the world with the disruption and cumulative decline of global economic activity. The liquidity problems of the developed countries have been further aggravated by the unprecedented increase in interest rates  which makes external borrowing very difficult. Added to that are difficulties in gaining access to international capital markets. 138.	In sub-Saharan Africa the current economic crisis has been aggravated also by the deteriorating food security situation resulting from drought. Although many developing countries in other regions have recorded marginal increases in food production  food production has not matched population growth in most of those areas.139.	The sooner we come to grips with the practical realities of the economic interdependence of the North and the South  the better for us all. This interdependence makes economic recovery in the North dependent upon the activation of development processes in the South. The view that economic prosperity in the North will have a trickle-down effect upon the South  thus generating growth  must  therefore  be rejected. We are faced here with a global crisis the solution of which demands a global approach. It is our strong opinion that the first step towards the discovery of the solution to this crisis lies in the realization that  whether we belong to the poor South or the richly endowed North  whether we are a superpower or a small Power  whether we espouse a capitalist or a socialist social and economic system  there are in fact many common international economic interests and goals whose attainment is possible only through a united approach and action by all of us. Perhaps this realization already exists and what is lacking is agreement on what steps we should take to attain the common goals. We of the South have invested our hopes in global negotiations as the most effective and most realistic instrumentality through which solutions to world poverty can be found. Unfortunately  however  the process of global negotiations has now stagnated for some time  partly because some leaders of the North have not yet come to perceive poverty in a global context and partly because some of those who see it as a world phenomenon still lack the necessary political will and courage to join hands with us.140.	We had also hoped that the sixth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development would provide a golden opportunity in the various areas of trade and development and in the monetary and financial dimensions of development and payment arrangements. Similarly  we had also viewed that session  and especially its decisions on the issues of trade  raw materials  commodities  money and finance  as providing new impetus and an important contribution to the global negotiations. Unfortunately  however  the sixth session  like the deadlocked global negotiations  also proved to be a huge disappointment to us of the South. Again  this is one of the several opportunities to solve the present global economic crisis which  sadly  have been allowed to slip through our fingers  to our common detriment  whether we are poor Southerners or rich Northerners.141.	Let me end this statement with a question which is bothering me  as it must  I believe  be bothering all members. When are we going to grasp the magnitude or seriousness of the economic crisis facing the international community  which is now threatening the very fabric of our societies? Is time really on our side  as some seem to suggest?"
